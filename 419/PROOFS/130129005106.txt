Dear Friend. Thanks a lot for your willingness to partner with me on my business proposal offer to you. Firstly=2C I must solicit your confidence in this transaction=3B this is by virtue of its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried=2C but I am assuring you that all will be well at the end of the day. Prior to my explaining further=2C I am conscious that this is certainly not a predictable way of approach to foster a relationship of trust but because of the circumstances and urgency surrounding this claim I decided to reach you via this medium to join me to put claims on this deposited consignment/fund before it is seized or confiscated by the Spanish authorities. The sum in question is US$7.4M (seven Million=2CFour Hundred Thousand United State Dollars Only) is as a result of an abandoned deposit by my late client. It is absolutely necessary for me to make it take the resemblance of an actual next of kin=3B this is where I need your assistance=2C as my duty is to provide the necessary documents to back up our claim. You see=2C Next of Kinship is not limited to relations of the deceased=2C nor is it confided to the circuit of parental relationship=2C rather it is by choice of the benefactor as regards to whom he wish to WILL it to (Beneficiary) either formally by write up=2C or informally by secret information disclosure to beneficiary be him/her business partner=2C relation=2C kinsmen=2C or friends or well wishers. My late client did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit company. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit with the bank. So the above mentioned amount is still lying with the bank and no one has ever or will ever lay claim on it. What bothers me is that according to the Spanish laws=2C i was given an ultimatum to look for some relative to come for the claim the deposit consignment/funds or will revert to the ownership of the Spanish Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Be informed that the fact that you are a foreigner gives you the privilege to stand in as my deceased client's beneficiary as my deceased client had no relation as all his family died with him during the incident and I cannot use my relation because it=92s not accepted here in Spain. Also I am very confident that we will be able to establish the trust that is needed to complete this deal and all that I need for the time being is your willingness and commitment so that we can end this in the next couple of days. What you need to understand about this transaction is that I will make sure that it  will be executed under a Legitimate banking arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law. Your obligation in this transaction is to accept to stand in as the only existing relative (Next of Kin) of my deceased client. I expect to receive your opinion on the issue of investing in your economy. Kindly send to me your full details as stated below to enable me forward same to the bank where the deposited consignment will be re-profiled to your name as the new beneficiary: 1. Your Full Names:2. Contact Address:3. Marital Status:4. Area of Specialization:5. Direct Tel And Fax Numbers6. Occupation:7. Nationality:8. Age:9. Scan a copy of your identification (such as international passport=2C driver's license or any proof of your identification. Once I receive the above required information details and also your acceptance to assist in finalizing this transaction=2C I will then have the courage to tender a presentation letter to depository bank to introduce you as the next of kin to my late client to proceed with the claim. Once the deposited fund is released to you=2C we shall divide the content in the ratio of 45% and 55% respectively (45% for you and 55% for me)  for me as our benefit. Each ($3=2C330=2C000 Million for you) and ($4=2C070=2C000 Million for me).However=2C I implore you to follow my guidelines and instructions to avoid any mistake from your side=2C also be informed to forward to me whatever response you may be receiving from the depository bank for my advice and guidelines to avoid any mistake from your side=2C because they might try to throw heavy questions across to you. I shall advise you on what to do for legal purposes. I am anticipating to reading from you soonest.
