Hello Mr. Leonard,
=20
I know you might be a bit surprise to receive a personal email from me as I=E2=80=99m sure you may have seen me on TV as one of the former ABC TV weather forecaster and some times Good Morning America show anchor.
=20
I assume you already know that my name is Heidi Jones; I  feel that you may have read in the news of my present predicament in my career due to the rape case I falsified and filed and then later pleaded guilty. I am  presently facing the three years=E2=80=99 probation sentence because I=E2=80=99m done performing the sentence of 350 hours of community service.  If by chance you haven=E2=80=99t heard of me, you can easily do a search on your computer by going to Google for more details.  I recommend you search for "Heidi Jones 350 hours of community service".
=20
Please don=E2=80=99t judge me for I have already been judged and sentenced and I will appreciate if you sincerely understand that this is not my reason for contacting you but for a very crucial project that I want us to execute as a family project. I believe that I can trust you base on the information I've personally gathered about you prior contacting you with the intention of this project which is going to be of mutual benefits to us. You should also understand why I cannot talk with you on the phone as I wouldn't want this information which is highly classified to get into a wrong hand or involve a third party which is why my communication with you will strictly be based on email.
=20
As you well know that I'm a journalist by profession, during one of the coverage and interview I personally conducted on the BP oil disaster in the gulf of Mexico on April 20th 2010 that killed 11 men, I was privileged to meet the late US Ambassador to Libya who was killed in US Embassy in Benghazi, late Ambassador Christopher Steven.

Without any dispute or argument, I believe you will agree with me that the Late Ambassador Christopher Steven was a very influential man. Through his source, an investment cash deposit was discovered and the deposit was in the name of one of the victims of the 20th April 2010 explosion of the BP Deepwater Horizon oil rig that killed 11 men. It was also discovered that the funds originally belong to the late President of Libya which was only in the name of late Eng. Blair Manuel as their usual ways of moving funds for a period of time and the terms of the deposit is for a period of five years.
=20
With the strong contact of the late ambassador, he also discovered that after the death of late Blair Manuel and the calamity that happened to the family of the late president of Libya, the investment cash deposit has been with the financial institution which was actually why the late Ambassador brought me in so I can retrieve the funds as a business partner to Late Blair Manuel with a US Ambassador claims backing. According to the late Ambassador, he want the funds to be utilized for charity projects under my supervision.

To be very sincere and honest with you, I was a mistress to the late Ambassador Christopher Steven and our affair was a secret one as I'm sure you understand what I'm talking about because he didn't want to put his political career in jeopardy. These funds are part of his compensation for me but we didn't know he was going to be killed in his office in Libya.
=20
Now the basis of which I'm contacting you is that I want you to represent me and act as the appointed business partner to late Blair Manuel in retrieving the funds and it will also be considerable if you can handle the charity project as soon as the funds are procured and released to you which should not exceed more than a week. If you would agree with me, its quite a complex project but I want you to know that there's absolutely nothing you should be worried about because the late Ambassador gave me some contacts as though he knew he was going to be killed. Its absolutely 100% risk free project if only you will strictly adhere to my instructions.
=20
Kindly assure me that I can trust you to handle this project for me and that you will not betray the trust I'm bestowing on you and please if you know you are not willing to stick to my instructions, kindly decline from responding.
=20
Peace and blessings,
Heidi Jones
