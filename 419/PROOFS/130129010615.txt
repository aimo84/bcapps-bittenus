Dear friend

Thanks for your reply and also sorry for my late reply too. I was out of
the country to China for an exhibition and which I came back last night. My
business proposal to you is all about an awarded contact by my ministry to
a Korea construction company; which we made an over invoiced of 25 million
U.S. Dollars and I want to present you as one of the subcontractors that
participated on the contract to receive the  25 million U.S. Dollars also
you should provide your information as been requested on my first mail to
enable us commence on the project and if you have any questions do not
hesitate to ask me.

I wait for your hearing...

Best regards,
Smith
