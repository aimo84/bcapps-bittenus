Dear Friend,=A0 =0A=A0=0AI must thank you very much for sparing your good time to respond to the business proposal that will benefit both parties at the end. Be assured, this transaction is risk free and a very genuine business.=A0 =0A=A0=0AOnce again, I am Mr Wang Shu, Director of Operations Hang Seng Bank Ltd, Sai Wan Ho Branch, Hong Kong and I am 58 years old looking forward to retirement with an intention of investing in a profitable venture in your country like real estate and estate properties.=A0 =0A=A0=0ASOURCE OF FUNDS...=A0 =0A=A0=0ABefore the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Mr Abd el-Oun Hassan who was a TOP Political party official and an Iraqi business man, made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of $6,500,000 (Six million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) only in my branch. Upon maturity, several notices were sent to him, even during the war in Iraq. Again after the war, another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that our client had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. Please visit the links below for further verification;=A0 =0A=A0=A0=A0=A0 =0Ahttp://www.iraqbodycount.org/database/individuals=0A=A0=0AAfter further investigation, it was also discovered that Mr Abd el-Oun Hassan did had a next of kin which was his wife and it was discorvered that she died alongside with her husband. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office, which no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, $6,500,000 (Six million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) is lying in my bank, and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country, at the expiration of 8 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government, if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr Abd el-Oun Hassan=A0 so that you will be able to receive his funds.=A0 =0A=A0=0AWHAT IS TO BE DONE?=A0 =0A=A0=0AI want you to know that I have everything planned out so that we can come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr Abd el-Oun Hassan, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names, contact Address and a valid copy of your identification documents (International passport or driver=B4s license) so that the attorney can commence his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account which you will be setting up in Europe. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method, and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.=A0 =0A=A0=0AMeanwhile, for the assistance you shall render me I will offer you 50% of total amount.
