/DEAR Leonard Zeptowitz,

 I thank you for taking your time to respond to my email,

 I know this is a bit strange to receive an email without prior knowledge or notification, but I respectfully request that you keep the content of our communication confidential for now and also beg your indulgence to hear me out.

 I have gotten across to you because in line with our internal process for Account Holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigation in good faith to determine who should have right of claim to his estate.

 This investigation has for the past months been unfruitful. Knowing full well failure to put forward a next of kin would result in the funds been reverted back to the treasury of the USB Corporation, I immediately instituted the services of a Private investigative team to assist me scanned the major continent of the world before we finally got to you. From our investigation, we found out the deceased ALFRED Leonard Zeptowitz has distant relatives in United Kingdom , USA AND CANADA , hence our quick communication to you.

 If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous.

 The bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin.

 It is against this backdrop we are formally approaching you to stand as the next of kin to the estate rather than allowing the funds be tagged as unclaimed.

 Please do not be alarmed as this would be a routine procedure as any other claims and with my official capacity (holding vital documents that will necessitate the release of the claim) on the estate claim, I will provide you with all the necessary documents that will enable release of the estate into your account.

 I will refer you to a lawyer in Spain that has represented clients in retrieving their inheritance with UBS in the past and he will work on your behalf from the beginning of claim to the end in ensuring the claim gets to you. As you’re inside person with UBS who will facilitate the claim in your favor, we request 50% of the claim once the funds hit your account.

 I want to reiterate the proceedings would be 100% risk free and you will not be breaking the law because we intend to use a professional legal team to legalize all document of claim and with your support we would complete this claim within 2 weeks.

 I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy. Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a family man; I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing　gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold.

 This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, send me your response on this email immediately to enable us commence the next line of action.

 I await your quick response to this email.
 Best regard.
 Mr. Patrick Forte./
