=C2=A0
=C2=A0I want to let you know that I have choose only you to assist me for this transfer, and I want you to understand that I choose you because God wants me to choose you, as I fasted and prayed to God to provide a God fearing person, a honest person that will help me in this transfer.=20
=C2=A0
A person that will take care of me, A person that will invest my money very well, A person that will manage my money well and a person that will not kill me to take my money, this is why I have contacted you, and I am very happy for your good response and I pray that we will live like family when I come to your country.=20

Before I will go on to make the transfer to your account, I will like to know you fully and very well so that I will have much information of whom I am dealing with. You know I can't just transfer my money to your account like that because I have not known you very well. This is why I have decided to build our relationship first, build trust and know ourselves much before we go on with the transfer, I am doing this because I want to be careful since this money is my only hope of future and survival as I plan to come down to your country to continue my staying.

Please give me more information about life in your country. I want to tell you that it is the bank where my late father deposited this money that will do the transfer. The bank knows the best way. My only duty is to tell them to transfer my money to your account in your country and they will do it because they are bank. Meanwhile, as we go ahead with the transfer, I will give you the opportunity to contact the bank and speak with them, so that you will get all information you want about the transfer from them.
