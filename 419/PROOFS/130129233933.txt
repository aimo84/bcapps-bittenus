Dear=C2=A0=C2=A0Partne,=C2=A0

Thanks=0A for your kind reply in respect of my business proposal. As regards to =0Athis transaction, I stand to assure you=0A that there is no problem in this transaction for it is 100% legal and =0Ayou only have to comply to my instructions so that you will not make any=0A mistake when we start the transaction.

My personal data is as follows:

1. NAME: Mr. James Williams
2. AGE: 42 Years
3. MARITAL STATUS: Married with three children
4. OCCUPATION: Banker
5. YEARS OF EXPERIENCE: 20 Years
6 STATE OF ORIGIN: Bobo Dioulaso
7. COUNTRY: Burkina Faso

BACKGROUND OF TRANSACTION;

The=0A Name of the deceased Customer was Mr. Park Jun-Yung, a foreigner from =0ASeoul Korea. He nationalized here for years before he died in 2000 in =0AAsian Tsunami Disaster. He was a contractor and the major supplier of =0Aagricultural equipments in West Africa. He had an account with our bank =0Aand I was his account officer for many years before his death.

Four=0A years after his death, I spent time, made all the necessary enquires to=0A find out if I can get anyone related to him, to come forward and claim =0Ahis fund left behind in our branch, but all my efforts proved abortive. =0AThis search lasted for over=C2=A06=C2=A0years but all to no avail. It was =0Aduring this search that I found out that the person that he used as his =0ANext of Kin died along with him in the in Asian Tsunami Disaster leaving=0A no one to claim his fund left in our bank for 12 years now.

=C2=A0The=0A banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than 13 =0Ayears, because the bank will send it to the bank's treasury as an =0Aabandoned or unclaimed fund.

Truly,=0A it was after this discovery and unsuccessful search to get any of his =0Arelation that I decided to contact you so that I can use your name for =0Athe claim of this fund. Consequence upon the fact that I do not want the=0A fund to be transferred into our bank=E2=80=99s treasury as an abandoned or =0Aunclaimed fund, I got this opportunity and decided to=0A contact you for the mutual benefit of our both families.

More so, I wish to point out that the total fund will be shared 60-40 between me and you.

=C2=A0As=0A I stated above, this transaction is risk free, legal and has no =0Anegative implication. I have perfected everything to guarantee success, =0Ayou should not be afraid of anything. Nevertheless, you must try to keep=0A it secret in order not to tarnish my image as a senior staff of this =0Abank. Most Importantly, I will like you to assure me that you will not =0Abetray this trust and confidence that am about to repose on you.

I have worked very hard in my life and I have always maintained high level of discipline and integrity. This is an=0A opportunity, which I must strive relentlessly to accomplish. Besides, in a no distant time, I will be leaving for retirement.

Finally,=0A if you wish to achieve this goal with me, kindly get back to me to =0Aenable me open a file with your name here in my office as the true next =0Aof kin to the deceased, and I will send you an Application Form which =0Ayou will fill and send to our Bank here to inform them that you have =0Acome to have your deceased partner=E2=80=99s fund.

Please indicate your willingness by sending the below information for more clarification and easy communication.
