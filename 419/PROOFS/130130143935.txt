Dear=A0Leonard Zeptowitz
=A0=20
=A0Thanks for your prompt response to my quest for a trust-worthy partner,=20

Nothing in live can be so more=A0 important to me more than this transaction which i have jealously guarding it for almost a decade now.

I therefore want to urge you to let us work together with oneness of mind in order for us to achieve success.

As you have read from my previous mail, the reason why i sent you this mail is because i need a foreign partner who i can present to the bank as the=A0 owner of the said fund (7.5 Million Euro) Therefore, to start with the processing, I will need the following information from you:
=A0
1). Your full name (as it is written on your id card or passport)

2). Your contact address with phone and fax number.

3). Your age. (Date of Birth)

4). Your Occupation.

5). Marital status (Married or Single)

Immediately i received those listed above information from you, i will proceed to programmed it on our computer central data-base files to inscribed your name and address as the real owner of the fund (7.5 Million Euro) lying fallow in the transit deposit account of our bank.

After i have successfully done this, I will then send you a drafted letter to officially apply for the claiming of your fund with our bank to be transferred into any bank account of yours in any country of your choice.

The entire bank management will look into it and grant me as the Foreign Remittance Department Director the authorization to release and remit the fund into your nominated bank account.=A0

Once again please bear in mind that this transaction is highly confidential !!!=A0

I await your quick and prompt reply.0022674565852
