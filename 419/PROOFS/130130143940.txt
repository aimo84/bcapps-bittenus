Assalamu Alaikum Warahamatulla Wabarakatuh

Dear Leonard,

Thank you for the response to my email, I decided to reply your email from
a different email address because I want us to have absolute
confidentiality when communicating regarding this transaction, I want to
begin by assuring you that we can consummate this transaction within 15
working days from the date of commencement. As the procedures relating to
the transaction mentioned is not a complex one. And good enough it's going
to be a bank-to-bank transfer therefore inherent risks are negated.

All it will take for you to commence this transaction is to write a letter
accompanied by your details in the form as i will stated it as soon as i
hear from you, this you will forward to my Bank's Legal Adviser/Attorney.
It will serve to introduce you to the bank, and of course trigger the
processing of your transfer request.

The bank will then carry out some verification procedures; example, they
will demand for the deposit and death certificate of the deceased every
document that the bank attorney shall demand from you. I shall provide.
Therefore, after making the request through the Bank Attorney by completing
and forwarding the form which i will send to you, he would naturally be
expected to contact you via you email or phone. Please ensure you utilize
an email that only you have access to, and I will also need to stress the
fact that the foregoing must be kept strictly between the two of us.

Your email to the Attorney should also serve to request from the department
the procedure(s) involved in claiming the funds entitled to you vis-=E0-vis
the documents I shall make available to you to forward to him when he
demands for such. I need to again stress the need for the two of us to work
together to achieve success.

I want you to assure me that you will only take the percentage that I have
already put forward to you which is 60/40 and nothing more. Humans tend to
always have a change of heart in issues relating to money. And since it is
going to be your account the funds will be transferred to, I need to be
able to trust you, and have a complete feel of confidence that my share
will also accrue to me when we conclude this transaction

The attorney that is representing the bank will take care of
everything.Therefore, once I hear from you, I will send to you a form and
the bank's attorney contact.

Thanks for your understanding.

Ahmed
