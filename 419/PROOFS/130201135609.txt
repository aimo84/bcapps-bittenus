Attn:Mr.Leonard Zeptowit ,

Thanks for your swift response. I think i have giving you enough details
you need about your inheritance payment of $8.3m ( EIGHT MILLION THREE
HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS) I want you to know that this
transaction is LEGITIMATE AND 100% RISK FREE.  All the documents i sent to
you in my previous email is part of your legal documents to confirm
legitimacy of this transaction.

This transaction is real and legitimate. We have all legal documents that
back up this transaction. More so, the FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION (
FBI )  is aware of this transaction because they have their intelligence
network at all corners and we made sure they are giving any copy of
letter that was sent to any of our beneficiaries.

 Your  name  Leonard Zeptowitz  and your email was found  in our CENTRAL
COMPUTER DATA BASE. The Federal Government of Nigeria and Federal Ministry
of Finance forward your name and approval documents that Central Bank of
Nigeria should release this payment of $8.3m to you as an award inheritance
funds.

The delivery man arrive since yesterday and he is now on TRANSIT i
Baltimore airport,Mary Land. He is not happy because he said he has been
calling your phone and its not going through. He is already stranded and he
is not happy about that.  He told me that the customs officers in the
airport are demanding for a DELIVERY PERMIT Payment of $1,300 before they
will allow him to deliver the consignment to you house in TEXAS.

Please contact him now and ask him how you can pay the money immediately so
that he will not remain in the airport , it is not good if he continue to
stay there because i don't want the customs to open the consignment and
discover the funds, that was the reason i instructed him to clear the
consignment on NON-INSPECTION BASICS.

  PLEASE REMEMBER that i did not disclose the content of the consignment to
the diplomatic officer , i only told him that the consignment contain
SENSITIVE MATERIALS,I was afraid to tell him because i don't want him to
run away with your funds.. DO NOT LET HIM KNOW WHEN CALLS YOU THAT THE
CONSIGNMENT IS CONTAINING US DOLLARS, Otherwise, he will disappear with
your funds. Further more, i want you to keep this delivery of your funds
stricly confidential till the diplomat  meet you and hand you over the 2
boxes, then i will give you the security code to UNLOCK the keys.

kindly contact him now and find out how you can pay the DELIVERY PERMIT to
the customs so they can allow him to board flight to TEXAS.. His name is
George Lambert, His email is :agentgeorgelambert1@gmail.com , Phone
7174354041.

Please keep me informed as soon as you pay the fee as he instructed you to
do.

Waiting for your update.

Mr.Lamido Sanusi
GOVERNOR,CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA
