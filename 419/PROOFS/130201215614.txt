You see she had no issue (child) and so she gave her funds to her brother and sister, she actually gave a rather large amount as a gift to her relatives and requested that they use some funds for charity, they thought she would die soon so they confiscated everything for their selfish use, this led her to will her remaining funds to someone else, I had often asked her about this someone else, all she told me was God will show her. I guess you are that someone.=0A=0A=0ANote that the details you received from her(Gil/Lee/678/4567/sfti/uk) was a probing move to establish contact, because I am sure you know as well as I do that most people would snatch at the offer considering the large amount involved considering the fact that the disbursement of this fund would be entirely in the hands of the claimant/beneficiary. For this reason she felt that after our initial communication I should be able to determine if we can proceed based on certain indices as well as intuitive feeling I would deduce. I shall undertake to collate relevant details with regards to the funds withdrawal process.( this will include the original deposit certificate issued by the finance house where her funds were deposited,{you will need to present this at the financial institute where the funds are presently lodged, and I will find it not imposition to assist you when that time comes.=0A=0AThe relevant information will be required from you as they will be used to prepare all legal documents which will put you in place as the next of kin to your benefactor,=0A=0AFull names:=0AResidential Address:=0ACountry of origin:=0ASex:=0ADate of birth:=0ADirect telephone(Mobile) & fax numbers:=0AOccupation:=0AAlternate Email Address:=0A=0AOnce you send the above details, the power of attorney will be drafted and further update on the next step in claiming your inheritance fund will be sent to you to enable you establish contact with the finance/security firm's.=0A=0APlease note that all paper works to gain you access to her funds which you are specifically to put to charitable use will be given you by me and all monies to do this paper work has already been offset, It is very important you keep this CONFIDENTIAL as Mrs.Leela Kidwell has requested your utmost confidentiality in this matter due to REACTIONS which could arise from her RELATIVES who has plundered her wealth to their selfish interest.
