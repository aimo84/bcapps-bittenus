Dear Beloved =2C

How are you today? Hope fine. i am very impressed with your response concerning this issue. Attached to this mail are photos of my home in NJ USA. Meanwhile when my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of GBP =A314.3Million with a Bank in London and this money is still in the Bank in London.

I have informed my attorney about this and i made it very clear to her that these funds should be transferred into any bank account nominated by you as the next of kin. Please I want you to assure me that my funds will be safe in your account since my ill health and old age doesn't permit me to stress myself anymore.

I have been in the hospital for six months because of breast cancer and i will be going for my operation any time from now=2C I pray that God will see me through in this operation. You and your family should pray for me to survive the operation and i know that God that has chosen you to carry out this charity project will guild you all through the project. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to any charity organization or good person that will utilize this money the way that will give glory to God. I want you to donate 30% of the total sum to any orphanage home=2C you decide what to do with the house sell it or leave in it.
