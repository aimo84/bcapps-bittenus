Dear Leonard.Zeptowitz,

Thanks for your feedback I do appreciate it.

The issue I want to bring to your knowledge is a very sensitive and highly
classified one. It may be very difficult for you to comprehend and accept,
but it is the very truth. If you are capable of handling it, you will see
with your very eyes.

I am providing you this information in confidence. Please find the details
below and do share your reservations with me if any.

I could not give you details in my first email because I want to be certain
we can work together. My name is Mr. Muhammad Musyafa Wiryanto, an
Indonesian citizen resident in the United Kingdom. I have lived in the
United Kingdom for 35 years where I received my basic education in life. I
am married with three kid=92s two girls and a boy.

Presently I am an account officer in a finance and brokerage house in the
UK, Lloyds TSB. I handle huge funds management and investment among other
services for our clients which comprises of individuals, companies,
celebrities, organizations etcetera.

For some years now, I have been painstakingly trying to reach the families
of one of my late client Mr. Canvin Edwin Maurice, who died in August 14th
2005 after a long battle with cancer.

He died leaving behind the sum of =A323,450,730.00 GBP (Twenty Three Million
Four Hundred and Fifty Thousand Seven Hundred and Thirty GBP).

I hired a private investigator who found out that there is no next of kin
that we can make the payment to.

I was very close to Mr. Edwin and can authoritative say he was a very
reserved and conservative person. Several times when I asked him to tender
his WILL to me for documentation, He always declined. I know he was married
once but divorced and never re-marry. He never had a biological child
neither an adopted one.

From the information I gathered about him when he was alive, its was
confirmed that he was homosexual which was what his wife found out after
five years of marriage hence the breakup.

I was Mr. Edwin=92s account officer for many years and most of the
information I have about him, were revealed to me as we discussed on a
personal basis and not documented officially. My office is not aware that
he has no next of kin because I have not mentioned it. If the management
were aware that there is no next of kin to Mr. Edwin=92s funds, it will be
disbursed among top management here, which will be a top secret.

Now with the constant outbreak of earthquakes in my country, I deem it
morally right to move this fund with the help of an outsider.  I can
actualize this easily without any legal complications to facilitate that
you are made the new beneficiary for the money and to see to it that it is
processed and released to you.

I intend to use 50% of the fund to help as much of the earthquake displaced
victims as possible. You will spearhead this project and my name will not
be mentioned. You will receive twenty percent (20%) as your commission for
your assistance and I will take the remaining thirty percent (30%) as my
share.

This transaction is not all about the money, but a passionate desire to
assist those many children and parents who have lost their loved ones
because of the earthquake and are still displaced right now without proper
shelter, clothing and food.

If I don=92t  move this fund with your help, top management here have a way
of disbursing unclaimed funds among themselves when it has been left for
many years. They can set up fictitious documentation to divert such fund. I
only recently discovered this practice, which is top secret.

So why allow them to selfishly continue to enrich themselves when we can
use such fund to assist humanity.

This is my driving force. The question is can you receive this huge sum of
money? This is a once in a lifetime chance, with no risk whatsoever
involved. With my position, everything can be worked out within the
shortest possible time to make you the bona-fide owner of the funds. I
cannot use anyone within my immediate sphere of contact as this could
jeopardize the transaction.

I will be waiting to hear from you, if you are willing and capable of
partnering with me for us to mutually benefit from this deal. The highest
level of confidentiality will be appreciated.
