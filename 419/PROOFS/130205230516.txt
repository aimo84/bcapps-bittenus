 Dear Sir,

Thank you very much for your swift response.  As I said in my first mail,
I'm the Director in charge of audit and account unit department of my bank,
Cambodian Commercial Bank Plc. I got your contact from internet directory. It's
necessary for me to seek your assistance, and I will appreciate it if your
ready to execute this project with me.

I will do everything legally required to ensure that the project
goes smoothly, it shall pass through all Laws of International
Banking Regulations.  I want to remind you that, it needs your commitment
and diligent follow up. If we work seriously, the entire transaction should
be over within two weeks.

Firstly, I want to know the type of occupation that you do and how old you
are. You should note that this project is highly capital intensive.
I need your total devotion and trust to see this through. I know we have
not met before, but I am very confident that we will be able to establish
the necessary trust that we need to execute this project. The amount
involve is US$13,400,000.00 with interest rate of US$3,485,000.00 totaling
US$16,885,000.00.

As I said in my proposal, it's 100% risk free, because I'm the
account manager to the deceased customer, and I am also the Audit Director
and I have the right to provide a Next Of Kin to our Late Customer. So, all
you need to do is to follow my instruction perfectly, and provide every
details necessary to transfer the fund to you then we proceed for the
sharing. The fund is unclaimed since 2006 because Nobody knows about the
fund, and the deceased Customer did not mention any Next of Kin.

So, this is how everything will be done:

I will edit the deceased customer details in our system, and attach your
details to it as next of kin to him,then I will look for a good reputable
lawyer here and send his contact details to you, so that you can contact
the lawyer to represent you to the Bank.

I will send account details of the deceased Customer to you and the deposit
Document which you will use to contact the Lawyer. You will contact the
Lawyer and tell him that your the next of kin to a fund belonging to your
late partner, and you will tell the Lawyer to represent you as your
attorney and make sure that the fund in the account of your late relative
is transferred to your account in your country. You will tell the attorney
that you need the fund urgently for a project.

Everything will be done through the Lawyer for our own security. You don't
have to worry about anything. I am the audit and account Unit Director, and
I will sign that your the true next of kin to the deceased Customer and
also sign for the transfer to any account you may provide.

I also want us to reach an agreement on how to share the fund before we
proceed. In my own Suggestion, I will appreciate if the sharing ratio could
be 60%/40% that is: 40% of the US$16,8850,000.00 for you, then 60% for me.
My retirement is coming closer, and this fund is my only hope for future,
my Salary is very Low and you know the poverty level here in Cambodia.

Send the Following details to me in your next mail so that I will know you
better and also attach the details in our system as the official next of
kin to the deceased.

1. Your Full Name
2. Your telephone Numbers
3. Your address
4. A copy of your international passport or driving license.

As soon as I receive the above mentioned details, I will send all
the deposit proof of the fund to you along with my ID card. Please,  ensure
that you keep this project confidential, do not discuss it with anybody,
because of the confidential nature of this transaction and my work. Keep
whatever your transacting with me with yourself alone for our future
security.

Please reply with your private e-mail address.

sincerely,
Mr Somrith
