Leonard,

Thanks for the swift reply. For immediate commencement, The first
installment payment of $25% will be remitted to you by Monday to facilitate
the basic renovation and home cleaning services as we have finalize the
necessary rent agreement. You will be required to take total control of
payment and cash disbursement for the various maintenance and renovation
measures for this apartment so the Supervisor in charge of the field
supervision will be directly in contact with you for funding and data
collection. Immediately after the renovation, you will be required to
consult and employ a home cleaning agency within you region for cleaning of
the entire apartment.

For a direct fund deposit, we required the following details:

I await your swift response to furnish the required details to the clients
for fund crediting. Other arrangements will be given by our renovation
