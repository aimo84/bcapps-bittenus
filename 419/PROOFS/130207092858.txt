Dear Friend

This is a life time opportunity and 100% legitimate. My fiance and I have
decided to make sure this is put on the internet for the world to see. You
see after taken care of the needs of our immediate family members and
friends, we decided to donate =A31 million pound each to other unknown 5
individuals around the world in need, the local fire department, the Red
Cross, and some other organizations in Asia, Europe and Africa. Your Cheque
is  been deposited with the  British Airways World Cargo Courier Company ,
the distributor of this donation scheme. We have kept some of the entire
lottery sum to ourselves for the raining day.

To speed up the disbursement process of the funds =A31 Million Pound [$1.56
million] which have been donated solely to you, please send us your contact
address and a valid identification of yourself so that we can forward your
details over to the British Airways World Cargo Courier Company
immediately. We are hoping that you will be able to use the money wisely
and judiciously over there in your country. You are advise to change your
password to your email for security reasons, to avoid double claims.
