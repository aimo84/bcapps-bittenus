Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,
 
I have seen your reply and noted, and if you sincerely agreed with my conditions all I need now is your corporation and sincerity not to disappoint me when you receive this fund in your account.

Before we proceed I must assure you that with my position in the government and my reputation as a person you will surely receive this fund if you will only keep this deal as top secret and confidential and also work accordingly by my guidelines and instruction with due process because i will not want my co-government officials to suspect me and also query my interest over your claim which will not be in our favor and that of the transaction in question, I hope you will understand the circumstances surrounding my office in the government.

Meanwhile i will make sure that everything will go through legal procedure, also you must maintain the confidentiality attached to this transaction.

However I must assure you once again that your interest will highly be protected here by me  and mutual understanding to work with me in one spirit to actualize our goal.

Before we now commence on the project i will need you to send the following details to enable me file your data on the payment  approval.

Your name:

Waiting for your reply soon.

Yours Sincerely.
