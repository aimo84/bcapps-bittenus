Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,=C2=A0

Thanks for your good interest to assist me, I will be happy to work with you, in order to finalize the transaction, I hope you understand my problem and the help needed from you. The only way we can realize good end of the project, just for you to keep any information you receive from me private and confidential. I will like you to understand the following things. Right now the box is still in the security vault for storage, without letting the security official to know that we are storing cash with them. Just for our security reasons. Rather I told them that I am having, stones and diamonds. Worth $17.2million in the box, because I don=E2=80=99t want them to know the real content of the box. ( for Security reasons).

At this moment we need to have meetings together with a financial business consultant here in South Africa, I have contacted this person and he promise to help us move the fund out of South Africa to your over seas account. But you need to travel down to South Africa, in order for you to open a non-resident account, in your name were the money will be longed before moving to your over seas account. All this arrangement will be made between you, financial business consultant personnel, and myself.

Please I ask you to make your urgent plan to come down to South Africa, because I am staying in South Africa as asylum seeker (refugee) which made me not to have right to operate bank account. This are the reason why the financial adviser told me to look for foreign business partner who will represent me as the beneficiary of the fund, remember I am paying for the security storage charges monthly, and I don=E2=80=99t want to delay so much time to avoid high security charges and them discovering the content of the consignment.

The most important is for us to know each other and have good table talk and build trust to each other, because if I loose this money, that is the end of my life try and reconsider your position to be here as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Best regards to your family.J. Katsande
