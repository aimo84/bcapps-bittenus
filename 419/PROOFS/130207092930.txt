Hello Dearest Leonard,

I have really been touched by your message, since when i sent my life
history message to you, i have been wondering high what your reaction will
be, because we have never meet or known each other before, but despite that
you replied me with sympathetic and courageous words.

I have choose you to assist me not by own doing my dear, through my late
fathers WILL it is compulsory that i must execute this transaction with a
foreigner and for this reason i have taken my time to pray about this
communication before i ever contacted you for this transaction and for your
help to make me come and complete my education in your country. I just
believe after prayers that i will meet someone like you, now by my mere
trust i have found you, I am sure you will not let me down.

Firstly i thank you for your indication of helping me now, because i so
muchly love to complete my education in your country, you will be managing
the funds for me while i will go back to school, i want to go straight to
the point, I am mailing you from the office of the Reverend Father who is
pastoring in the camp, i have confide on him, i did explained a bit about
my situation to him but not everything, he gave me the access to his
computer twice a day just to help me because i told him that i want to get
out from Africa as soon as possible, but firstly i must get the fund
transferred into an account abroad, since i don't have any body abroad i
decided to contact you, only if you will be honest and kind to my situation
and assist me with all sincerity in your heart.

This is Rev.Fathers telephone number: +226 79-78-98-09 When you call, tell
the Rev.Father that you will like to speak with Miss zilda Thomas Hanson,
From Female-Hostel 0048, he will send for me to come and answer your call.

I will like you to send to me your full data such as:

1. Your full names
2. Your contact address
3  Your Age
4  Your phone numbers, these information's will enable me to write to the
bank and submit to them your details introducing you as my partner and
trustee.

On receipt of this information i will forward to you all the account
information and the contact of this bank were this money is deposited and
the information covering this deposit with the bank, I am looking forward
to read from you soonest.

Please note that after the transaction we will work for my coming to your
country within 1 or 2 weeks time, Please my most importantly i will like
you to assure me that you will keep this very transaction and myself secret
pending the confirmation of the money in your bank account. I will be
expecting your immediate reply and your assurance to keep this very
transaction secret without involving or disclosing it to a third party.
