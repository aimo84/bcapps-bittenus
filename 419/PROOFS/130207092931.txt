Dear friend

Thanks for your mail and may the almighty God bless you for your positive response. With due respect and humble i appeal you give attention and read through my story.

I am the only son of my father=2C the Late President of Ghana. President John Evans Fiifi Atta Mills=2C who died on Tuesday July 24th 2012 at the 37th Military Hospital in Accra. Before the death of my father my step mother never wanted to set her eyes on me=2C she wanted me wiped off in my fathers house=2C and during the time my father was in position as President of Republic of Ghana i never for once visited home till his untimely death.

My father send me to the UK at the age of 11years for my education! due to threat to life by my step mother. I am a student of Anglia Ruskin University United Kingdom=2C now presently in my country Ghana.

After the burial of my father=2C my step mother conspired with my father lawyer's as they have left me with nothing from my father's properties=2C am in a deep pain/sorrow=2C i can't stop crying...... i miss my dad so much=2C i never stop dreaming of him=2C please if you want to help me=2C help me from the deepest of your heart and the almighty God will bless you for helping the helpless.

So while going through my father's briefcase where he use to store his personal document's i did found out some document's which indicate that he have deposited some amount of money/gold with  Ghana ministry of finance in corporation with Anchor Atlantic Security Company on my name as the next of kin=2C i have contacted Ghana ministry of finance general manager Dr. Francis Kwaku Ampetey=2C to my greatest surprise i was being informed by the manager that my father instructed them not to release the fund/gold to me not until I am married or present a trustee who will help me invest the money wisely.

I'm searching for only humble reliable honest and God fearing person who will help me with passion/love so that i introduce you to the Ghana ministry of finance as my legible trustee.

I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating your ability and willingness to handle this deal.

Sincerely

Samuel Kofi Mills
