Hello,
Before we go further it is most pertinent that I explain to
you the source of this funds. In July 2011 we bought a debt instrument
(Bank Guarantee) of 500 Million Euro issued by Crédit Agricole Corporate
& Investment Bank France in favor of an Importer with a discount
(interest) rate of 87 % (2% mark up).The deal was offered by Crédit
Agricole Securities (USA) Inc here in New York with the Principal Paying
Agent as CACEIS Bank Luxemburg. We perfected the deal and the exporter
signed the commercial contract with the importer and delivered the
goods. We paid the exporter and 15 months later the Instrument matured.
HSBC bank (US) is taking their principal and interest and CACEIS Bank
has just requested our account for remittance of our commission. The
commission has a 2% mark up calculated at 10 Million Euro which is
actually the amount we are remitting to your account. This profit is for
the entire group but Rule 144A of US Securities Act of 1933 throws in
some limitations against us, we therefore required the services of a
Commission Agent to front for the payment hence I contacted you. So I
would like to know if you have an account so we can submit your name to
the bank as beneficiary and the bank will remit to you. At this time it
is also expedient that we agree on the terms of this cooperation. So
lets have you terms so I can discus it with my colleagues and if we all
agree we proceed. I will only advice that you keep your terms down as it
is not a one off payment and you stand the chance to benefit more with a
turnover. 
I will send you the Base Prospectus of the bank guarantee for
your perusal.
With warm regards,
John Sullivan
