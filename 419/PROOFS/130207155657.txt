Dear:Leonard Zeptowitz,

Sir,

It is with the greatest pleasure and providence that I received your
email against my business proposition.

Given the fact that time is now of essence as we require to move
faster as a result of the short time given to conclude this.

It is important that we begin the filing process immediately to stop
any further cancellation as planed by the Holding House.

Do immediately send to me, copy of your ID, such as Int. Passport or
Drivers license, I also need your telephone number incouding your address.

As soon as I receive the above as detailed, my protocol officer at the
chamber will immediately make contact with the notary public for the
filing of claimed to obtain an affidavit in your favor as the legal
Next of Kin to my late client.

Please, can you get this right away so we can begin on Monday.

Thanks,

Paul Smith (Esq)
