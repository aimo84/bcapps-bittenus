Good day Leonard

Thank you so much for taking time
to get back concerning my proposal to you. I am Peter Wong=2C Non
Executive Director of Hang Seng Bank Ltd=2C Hong Kong. An Iraqi named
Haider Hanoo. A business man made a numbered fixed deposit of Forty
Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my
branch. Upon maturity several notice was sent to him=2C even during the
war=2C Five years ago (2008). Again after the war another notification
was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that
Haider Hanoon and his family had been killed during the war in Gunfire
that hit their home at Mukaradeeb where his personal oil well was.

After
further investigation it was also discovered that Haider Hanoon did not
declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work
of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at
my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So=2C
Forty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still
lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What
bothers me is that according to the laws of my country at the
expiration seven years six months the funds will revert to the
ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds.

Be informed that the fact that you are a foreigner gives
you the privilege to stand in as my deceased client beneficiary as my
deceased had no relation=2C all his family died with him during the war
and i can not use my relation because it's not accepted here in Hong
Kong. Also I am very confident that we will be able to establish the
trust that is needed to complete this deal and all that I need for the
time been is your willingness and commitment so that we can end this in
the next one week.You may not know this but people like myself who have
made tidy sums out of comparable situations run the whole private
banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do=2C I do not find
against good conscience=2C this may be hard for you to understand=2C but
the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such
opportunities only comes one way once in a life time. I cannot let this
chance pass me by=2C for once I find myself in total control of my
destiny. These chances won't pass me by.

I ask that you do not
destroy my chance=2C if you will not work with me let me know and let me
move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man I have
wife and children and this is an opportunity to provide them with new
opportunities=2C I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to
what the consequences=2C but I know within me that nothing ventured is
nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a
platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private
banking clients. Do not betray my confidence.There is a reward for this
project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the
risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with
me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation=2C
good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the
center of relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing.

What
you need to understand about this transaction is that I will make sure
that it passes through all international banking laws regards to this I
will take care of all the expenses and the cost of retaining the
service of my Attorney to give the transaction the proper documentation
that is required to perfect the finishing.Your only obligation in this
transaction is to accept to stand in as the only existing relative of
my deceased client and you will have to set up offshore account that
can accommodate these funds with a Finance bank which I will give you
information later once we finalize this deal.

Further more I sending you my personal information.. below=3B
Name: Mr.Peter Wong
Address:39A Morrison Hill Road=2CHong Kong
