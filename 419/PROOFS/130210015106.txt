Thanks for your mail my dear Leonard; i have heard what you said in your
mail to me, i want to use this opportunity to let you know that i have
spent some lot of money already over this fund before contacting you, by
doing some secret underground work as the personal accountant to late Mrs.
Nina Wang making sure that i safe guide the fund from been confiscated by
our federal government here since the death of Mrs. Nina Wang. I have the
record of all the money i have spent so far, over $30, 000 dollars. I am
not counting on that because i know what i am pursing.

The most important thing that i needed from you is your maximum
cooperation working with trust and honesty to enable us have a successful
conclusion of this great opportunity and achieve our aim in it.

Attach in this mail is a text of application form which you are to fill
and send to the foreign remittance department of my bank for their
recognition and approval, but please before you send the application
letter to the bank you must first of all send a copy of the filled
application to me so that I will go through it and advice you if needed.

I have given you my words as the personal accountant to late Mrs. Nina
Wang that this transaction will not involve you into any problem now and
in future as I will be guiding you as we proceed.

Thanks and I will be waiting to receive the filled application form.

Sincerely yours
Isaac John.
