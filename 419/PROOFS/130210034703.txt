Dear Leonard,=0A=0AHow was your weekend? I am convinced within me that we shall conclude this transaction sincerely. It is a risk free transaction. I work for the ministry as informed you on the proposal and the Amount involved is US$4,500,000.00 M (Four million five hundred thousand united states dollars). Like I said in my very first email, this amount accrued as access money realized from over invoiced contract money over some considerable time. To achieve this deal, I have mapped out the underneath steps for the successful transfer of this money to you.=0A=A0=0A(1) I will program your names into our computer data base as the owner of the money=0A=A0=0A(2) With your names duly programmed on our database, I will then issue backdated documents showing your name as a contractor whose money is yet unpaid. The backdated documents would also indicate that the money in question in the bank account is yours.=0A=A0=0A(3) I will then provide you with a draft application with which you shall fill and email same to the bank, requesting Closure of the Escrow Account/wire transfer of the proceeds to your designated bank account.=0A=A0=0A(4) You will have 40% of the total sum of money for your assistance.=0A=A0=0AWith the above structures, you practically become a contractor and the owner of the money. When you therefore apply to the bank for closure of the account/transfer of the funds to your designated bank account, the scenario would wear the context of a foreign contractor who wants his or her account closed and the funds transferred to him abroad.
