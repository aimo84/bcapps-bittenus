Dear Sir, 

The compensation program is for scammed victims and individuals who are yet to receive their compensation payment. USD550,000 has been set aside as compensation to individuals who have lost money as a result of impostors from Africa duping them of valuable sums.

If you are not one of such people, then the email shouldn't have been sent to you.

Regards,
Ted Anderson
