 Dear Friend=2C=20
        Thank you for your response. There is no risk what so ever=2C as regards to this money. But the most important thing is that I do not want this money to go through the bank around here=2C It will not be safe for us=2C I have a very good=2C trusted and reliable diplomatic courier contact used mostly by our forces in Jordan=2C that can send goods easily through diplomatic and private military way=2C to anywhere in the world=2C without them being checked at any port of entry.They can deliver this money for you easily=2C to any address of your choice.

The baggage will be tagged as personal effects and covered with a diplomatic coverage consignment trunk box=2C and the courier company will not know the contents of the boxes. A few friends have used this means to convey goods=2C without being checked because of the diplomatic coverage system. Their charges are very high=2C but I will negotiate a way out from this end=2C till it gets to your door step anywhere and I will follow up immediately and meet with you for disbursement after you have received it.

I am very sure you will know the best way to handle this money for us=2C when it gets to your base. Please let me have an address where you want them to deliver the goods to you. It could be a bank address or your Company address. As soon as I get it=2C I will start making arrangements as to sending the merchandise to you.

Your Direct Phone number is needed=2C so you can be contacted as soon as Shipment is in Motion. I will send the total funds since I can not take any chances by keeping cash on me. Your percentage still stands at 30%. Meanwhile' I will like to know What you do for a living? Are you married with kids? Can you handle these funds? I will also want to see your passport copy or id/=2C driver=92s License=2C so I can know who I am dealing with .We need to build trust okay? The only people that knew about this is just me and my partners . Please if you know that you are not capable of handling this huge sum=2C please don=92t allow me to send it=2C I can always find other means of dealing with this.You can also see this link below for you to have a clue of what I am talking about.

You know that the security is very important=2C you can not trust anybody therefore note that this transaction is not safe on the phone=2C remember to keep it secret. I cannot call you on the phone or receive fax. The total sum amount in the box is $15=2C000=2C000 MILLIONS US DOLLARS and I hope that you can handle it? I hope you are okay with this?Everything must be done by email until the funds get's to your possession.I hope you understand me ? I need your urgent reply in this regard.

Yours Friend=2C
