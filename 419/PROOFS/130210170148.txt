I will give you=A0 =0ASeven Hundred Thousand United States dollars ($700.000), in which you =0Aare only allowed to take out 20% from the money for your private use, =0Awhile the rest of the money should be using in God`s work. I hope I have=0A make=0A myself clear to you?=0A=0AYou have to make sure the 80% left would be=0A properly applied to the Christian works because the bible tells us in =0AProverbs. 21: 6 that the getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a =0Avanity tossed to and from them that seek death. As a servant of the =0Aliving God, I will want you to take your time and pray about this and =0Are-assure me that you will use the fund as instructed, because using =0Athis fund accordingly will be the only way my spirit will be at rest. =0APlease, I want you to understand that this benevolence is in fulfillment=0A of my desire and decision, which I am persuaded to actualize just like I=0A have done to many people: I have designated this fund for humanitarian =0Aand Charity services with special emphasis and must be disbursed with =0Aevery appropriation, accountability and prudence to the glory of God.
