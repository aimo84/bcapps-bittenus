Dear beloved

Thank you for your response=20
and I must first of all show my appreciation over the fact that you have
 heard to the entreaty of a dying woman.  Like I mentioned in my=20
previous mail=2C I lived a very reckless life but When I discovered this=20
ailment=2C it dawned on me that I had been living a very vain life. The=20
need to affect the lives of those in need became very paramount in my=20
thoughts. This appears to be a case of mercy after death as I no longer=20
have the strength to do those things I used to do when I was still very=20
full of life.
=20
My dear=2C in my resolve to actualize my dying wish=2C
 I have been able to support charity to a very large extent around the=20
Middle East=2C Europe and Africa before my health became a sorry tale that
 I now have to live at the mercy of drugs and operations. This certainly
 can not remedy anything but it will make a dying woman go to grave=20
happy but my family members are however not happy with the way I have=20
disbursed things and alms to charity. They held for themselves the funds
 I made available for some charity organizations and went as far as even
 trying to terminate my life. All my relations have been severed and=20
they are of the opinion that the last of my money goes to them for their
 selfish desires.

However=2C I have the sum of Eight Million Two=20
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($8=2C200=2C000.00USD) in a BANK IN NIGERIA=2C I kept
 that money as secured deposit in case I face any mishap in life and=20
that was from the last of my years in the stock market starting as far=20
back as 1980's. You will be given 20% of the total amount as=20
compensation to help me propagate the works of charity where you reside=20
and to the extent of the balance after deducting your own=2C I would need=20
your utmost sincerity=2C devotion and honesty to carry the venture along=20
successfully.

 If you agree to work with me=2C I would like you to=20
tell me a little about yourself so I have a clear image of who I am=20
working with=2C are you married=2C do you have children=2C what is your=20
occupation=2C where are you from and most importantly are you trust=20
worthy? I find it hard to trust especially now that my family is after=20
me and with the amount of money I will be entrusting to you=2C but I just=20
believe this is how God wants me to affect the world in my own little=20
way. I am sure you are a very sincere person and I don't want to rush or
 force you into this=2C but I may not be around for long=2C as my doctors=20
say my time is very close=2C so I want you to find a place in your heart=20
of hearts to fulfill the entreaty of a dying man. Are you willing to=20
give your 100% devotion to the actualization of my wish? If your answer=20
is yes=2C then God bless you and you will never regret your actions.

I
 ask of you to deal with me honestly and render me your assistance to=20
the fullest of your capacity knowing whatever you do for me is to the=20
glory of the good lord and You would be helping a dying woman and most=20
importantly you would be touching the lives of a huge number of people=20
because My bones are slowly cleaving to my skin and I hope I would be=20
able to count on you in my last hours.

I hope to hear from you sooner than later.

Warmest Regards=2C
Mrs Joy Peters
