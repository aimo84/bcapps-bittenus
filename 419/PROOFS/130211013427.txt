Dear Beloved=2C

Greetings in the name of the Lord! As I said in my e-mail before=2C my name is Mrs. Janet Obeid. I have decided to donate my cash inheritance from my late husband (Mr. Richard Harold Obeid) for charity projects because of my terminal illness. You may wonder how I got your contact and what informed my decision to donate my inheritance to you=2C when I have lots of people I know better and could trust for this kind of project=2C my dear=2C let these questions not bother you=2C for I mean well.=20
As per your contact=2C I got it online according to the direction of my spirit. Recall I said in my previous e-mail that I was led by my spirit to choose you for this assignment. I decided to use my cash inheritance for this noble charity project because my marriage with my husband ended childless. I was 50 years old=2C 2 years ago=2C when I was first diagnosed of this cancer=2C which occurred shortly after my husband=92s death=2C a situation that plunged me into hypertension and eventual partial stroke. In my present state of health=2C life is meaningless and hope dims every passing moment for me. At the thought of my battered and shattered existence=2C I am usually overwhelmed by despair and gloom.=20
It is mainly my hopeless and helpless situation that prompted me to decide on this project to better the lives of the less privileged or disadvantaged out there=2C as my own last token of contribution to humanity. I must confess that I was really touched by God to do this.  I decided not to donate this money to anyone I know around=2C because if I did=2C upon my death=2C my husband's relatives will engage such beneficiary in legal battle=2C claiming  my action was without their consent  and as such 'null and void=92. They may attempt to use their influence to pervert the course of justice and recover the donation=3B a thing I hate to imagine! My husband's people are vicious and wicked such that it'll amount to betrayal of my late husband if I let them access and enjoy the fruits of his hard labor after all their misdeeds against their late brother. God forbid that I will do a thing as cowardly as that. You can now see the combination of factors that prompted the donation/charity initiative.=20
What I want you to do is to invest the money in any area of business you have relevant experience and knowledge to manage=2C which is viable and profitable=2C and at the end of each year=2C you should disburse 50% of the profit for charity purposes and put 30% back in the business for expansion=2C leaving 20% for yourself as compensation. This way=2C the charity funds will not only be sustainable to serve many generations but will generate employment and empower jobless persons around. This is my vision and that is the way I want you to handle this project without fail. I want you to guarantee me that you will commit and devote yourself for this task and sincerely and honestly disburse the resources I am giving you to accomplish it. For no reason should you given in to the temptation to divert the funds into self-serving purposes. As you discharge this assignment with sincerity and honesty=2C God will surely reward you His own way. Please=2C because I do not want my husband's relatives=2C who spy over me=2C to know of my latest decision/action (at this stage) and for health reason(s)=2CI shall not entertain phone calls and Conversations. If you are sure  that you will use the donation as I have directed=2C please provide me the following requirements for onward delivery to my bank with letter of introduction and authorization letter to my bank to pay you the amount I need scan of ether your driving license or international passport:-
