Beloved Leonard Zeptowitz,

Praise thy Lord and greetings in the name of our lord and savior Jesus
Christ. Brief introduction about my self.  I am Man of God and a Reverend.
I have served as a social worker many years ago while I was still
undergoing training as a Reverend. I have strong passion for the orphanage
and the downtrodden apart from my calling as a minister of Christ.

I worked as an estate developer before I was called into full time ministry
and I have supported few humanitarians agencies and orphanages around and
has donated money for schools etc but right now, I have a serious case of
Severe Esophageal Cancer which I am trust the lord for his miracle.  I have
prayed about it and some brethren have prayed with me also and after I have
waited long to receive healing from the lord and it seems nothing is
happening then I decided to use my seed money to challenge God by donating
to Charity. This is few attempts I have made but I believe with time you
will get to know more about me by the time I introduce you to my personal
attorney whom you will meet very soon.

Already, I am experiencing a whole lot of pains and tiredness as I am
writing this message but I had to encourage my self to ensure I stay in
touch with you. The medical expert monitoring my case have declared that I
have few more weeks to live before I die since it is now obvious that the
cancer had eaten deep into my blood and there is no alternative but that is
the report of the doctors but for God with him everything is possible and I
am believing and trusting God for the miraculous.

However, the year is fast running out and we really need to move fast to
ensure the fund is wired into your account for the humanitarian service. I
am optimist that the experienced you have put together in the various field
of endeavor would be useful to expand the humanitarian service and at the
end, all of us who participated will be richly blessed. Hence, it is my
desire to donate the fund as my contribution and total submission to the
Will of God and to humanity  and in case you are still  willing to handle
this project solely  please reply back so that I can recommend you to
lawyer and my bankers as the person appointed to receive my donation.

We will keep in contact for a while until you have established sufficient
knowledge about me as the amount involved in this program is substantial.
If God willing my wishes will be accomplished. Do this prayerfully in
Christ.

Remain blessed,

Rev.Oliver Peters.
