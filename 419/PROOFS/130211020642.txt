MY GOOD COMPANION,

THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUICK RESPONSE, MEANWHILE 
MY LATE HUSBAND WAS KILLED DURING THE U.S. RAID AGAINST TERRORISM IN 
AFGHANISTAN, AND DURING THE PERIOD OF OUR MARRIAGE WE WERE UNABLE TO 
PRODUCE A CHILD. AFTER HIS DEATH, I INHERITED ALL HIS BUSINESS AND 
WEALTH. THE DOCTORS HAS ADVISED ME THAT I MAY NOT LIVE FOR MORE THAN SIX
 MONTHS, SO I NOW DECIDED TO DIVIDE THE PART OF THIS WEALTH, TO DONATE 
TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHURCH IN AFRICA, AMERICA ASIA, AND EUROPE, I 
PRAYED OVER IT.

I AM WILLING TO GIVE THE $8.6MILLION DOLLARS, TO THE LESS PRIVILEGED.

RIGHT
 NOW THE FUND IS DEPOSITED WITH A BANK IN USA. I AM OF AWARE THAT THERE 
ARE LOTS OF SCAM IN INTERNET, I SWEAR TO YOU WITH THE NAME OF OUR LORD 
THAT THIS IS NEVER A SCAM. YOUR HELP WILL SAFE MANY LIFE IN THE WORLD, 
LET GOD TOUCH YOUR HEART TO HEAR MY CRY. LASTLY, I ALSO WANT
 YOU TO ASSURE ME THAT WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE FUND IT WILL BE USED FOR THE
 SAID PURPOSE. MAY THE GRACE OF OUR LORD JESUS THE LOVE OF GOD AND THE 
FELLOWSHIP OF GOD BE WITH YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

I AWAIT YOUR URGENT REPLY.

YOUR'S IN CHRIST.

SONIA WILSON
