Thank you very much for your response, and your interest in this
transaction.
Like I said before, due to this issue on my hands now, it became necessary
for me to seek your assistance, I appreciate the fact that you are ready to
assist me in executing this project, and also you will help me in investing
my money in your country, I am quite certain about that.

You should not have anything to worry about, I will do everything legally
required to ensure that the project goes smoothly, it shall pass through
all Laws of International Banking, and you have my word.

The attorney will prepare the necessary Affidavits which shall put you in
place as next of kin; he will obtain the necessary clearances from the
authorities which will cover all the aspects involved in this transaction.
This attorney shall be handling all matters of probate on your behalf, he
will have all the documents perfected, and with these documents he shall
come forward to my bank to apply for the immediate release and transfer of
the funds to the account you shall open. I have been a banker for many
years and I know perfectly how the system works.

Having resolved to entrust this transaction into your hands, I want to
remind you that, it needs your commitment and diligent follow up.
If you work seriously, the entire transaction should be over in a couple of
days.

READ THE FOLLOWING AND GET BACK TO ME:

Firstly, I will want to know precisely your full names, current address and
telephone and fax numbers, I have to be very careful, I need your total
devotion and trust to see this through. I know we have not met before, but
I am very confident that we will be able to establish the necessary trust
that we need to execute this project.

I am now in contact with a foreign online bank; I now intend that you open
an account in your name in this foreign bank. The money would be
transferred to your account which you will open in the bank for both of us,
this is the best way, I have found, it will protect us from my bank.
I want us to enjoy this money in peace when we conclude. So you should
listen to my instructions and follow them religiously. Also You have to
know that I cannot transfer this money in my name as my bank will be aware
that it is from me, this is where I need you.

As result of this, you will have to open an account in the corresponding
bank. I will obtain a certificate of deposit from my bank, it will be
issued in your name, and this will make you the bonafide owner of the
funds. After this, the money will be banked online for both of us. We can
then instruct the bank to transfer our various shares into our respective
home bank accounts. I will also perfect the documentations with the
assistance of my attorney to give the transaction the legal right.

Before I commence, I will need you to send me a copy of any form of your
identification (Driver's license, Work ID or International passport) I will
need to have your current address but I want to be sure that I am
transacting with the correct person. As soon as I get these from you, I
will commence the paper work.
I hope you will understand why I need all these; I want to ensure that I
know you well before I proceed to give you all the details to commence the
project, my curiosity can be justified considering the money in question,
besides, it is this copy of your Driver's License, work ID or International
Passport that will be used by the Attorney to have all the necessary
documentations perfected.

Upon receipt of your identification, I will send the name and contact
details of the bank and their website to you so that you can commence
communication with them.
Ensure that you keep this project confidential; do not discuss it with
anybody, because of the confidential nature of this transaction and my work.

Please reply soonest
Regards

Mr. Pairat Phansuwan
