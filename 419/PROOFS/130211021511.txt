Dearest in christ
God will grant you the willingness and interest to digest this humble narrations though it might be so surprise and strange to believe my story but I knew by the reason of the almighty you will humbly understood and accept to proceed with my proposal though we have not met or seen each other before. I am Mrs. Rose=C2=A0 a widow to Mr. Thomas who was a competent business man here in Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso, we were married for many years without any child till his death in October 2005 after a brief illness. Due to the promise which I revered to him on the alter at the day of our church wedding I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which is against the holy bible.
My happiness is that my late husband lived a life of a true & worthy Christian and he has this plan before his death which he pleaded with me to appropriate it to accomplishment. He took this decision with me to use this fund in building an orphanage in his name that will accommodate thousands of children, and also to use part of this fund in helping the less fortunate and to spread the gospel of the lord to the remote places of the world. He made this deposit of the sum of 5.9 Million dollars in a Finance Security Company here in Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 3 weeks due to cancer & stroke illness.
Having known my condition I decided to seek for a competent and reliable individual, organization, company, NGOs or churches to entrust this fund to utilize this fund the way I narrated above as my late husband desired. The Bible made us to understand that =C2=ABBlessed is the hand that gives". I took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my late husband's relatives are not Christians and I don't want my late husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know where i am going. I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health hence the presences of my husband=E2=80=99s relatives are around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.
As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the relevant Information=E2=80=99s that will legalize you to have access over this fund. I will also issue an Authorization to the Finance Security Company that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund. I want you to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd. My happiness is that I and my late husband lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life and pray to God to forgive me my sins. Contact me Immediately, any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for another=C2=A0 cooperate individual that is honest, trustworthy and very conscious of needs of less fortunate. Who would be much honored to work for humanity for this same purpose?
Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to receive your reply.
Yours Sister in Christ,
Mrs.Rose Thomas
