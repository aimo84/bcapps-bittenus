Good Day my dearest,

Thanks a lot for your prompt respond and also for accepting to help me
and my only daughter out of this heartbreaking situation. I'm mostly
concern that you help me in this transaction and my contact was based
on the information I gathered regarding this transaction to enable us
achieve our aim in having this fund been transferred into your
bank account in your country as a fund manager to my family.

I want you to know that this transaction needs absolutely a Foreigner
to put claim to the said amount as a ''fund manager'' to my family.
This transaction will be successfully executed to your bank account as
the agreed fund manager of my family without any query from your state
government or private bodies, However with all the necessary
information which I have gathered regarding this transaction to ensure
a smooth and successful transfer.

Note: This transaction will follow legal modalities and all the needed
documents will be obtained. These documents will back up the transfer direct to your bank account in your country.

Be aware that I will come over to your country with my daughter for
sharing of the fund and possible investment into any profitable
venture under your kind control as soon as the transaction is
completed.

If possible I will love to invest in real estate management or set up
a company with you in your country or any other place of your choice,
I trust you and that was why I contacted you as the only capable
person to champion this transaction.

Please I beg you in the name of God not to betray or cheat me after
the transaction is completed because the hope and future of me and my only child depends on this fund.

Meanwhile you are required to send me the following information which
will be used to prepare some backup documents that will confirm you as
our family agreed and approved fund manager

1. Your name.
2. Address.
3. Country of Origin.
4. Country of resident.
5. Your private telephone number.
6. Your occupation.
7. Sex.
8. Age.

On the receipt of this information, we shall forge ahead for good. You
can easily reach me at any time. Should in case I am not around when
you call, please feel free to discuss with my daughter Sonia on 00226
66375242 for she is in position of the cell phone most times.

My best Regards,

Yours faithfully
Mrs. Naser Habib.
