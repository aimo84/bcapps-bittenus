Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thanks for your reply, Can you please confirm to me that you will
really make use of the fund as i said that you should take 30% of the
fund and share the rest to orphanage homes/the needy once to fulfill
my wish to enable me forward you all the information=92s about the fund
now that i have access to internet before it will be too late as I
don't know what the next day will bring forth, Like I said in my
previous mail that it will only cost you for change of ownership fee
according to the bank. Just to change the fund to your own name
because the bank made it clear to me when I informed them about my
decision over the fund that following their rules and regulation the
cannot transfer such fund from the depositor's account to another
account without conducting a change of ownership, So please don't be
discouraged because of the change of ownership as the change of
ownership doesn't cost much money.

Remain bless,
Mrs C Melly
