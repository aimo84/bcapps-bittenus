My Dearest one

May you be blessed in the name of the LORD.

Thank you so much for your quick reply to my mail, may God be with you always.
I know that my mail have surprised you but I got your contact after my 
prayers to God and i honestly believe it was God who really works in 
mysterious ways that directed me to you trusting you will not fail me. I
 wish you to secure and invest this money which i shall cause to be 
transferred to you,We have not actually met before but I have no choice 
than to contact you believing that by virtue of your status and 
religious position you will not disappoint me in this situation.

After this fund is transferred to you,you will donate 50% to charity 
homes and orphanages and 20% for the advancement of evangelizing work of
 God and retain the remaining 30% for your inconveniences, efforts and 
any expenses that could arise from the transfer.
I am too weak and down and afraid that i might not survive my situation 
but God knows the best and i pray that whatever happens to me, you 
should take care of this project which I want to do for the work of the 
Lord.

I shall be going in for a surgery operations soonest and desire this 
money to be transferred to you sooner before my surgery I do not wish to
 leave this money in the bank because the bankers might misuse it.My 
late husband`s relatives who should have assisted me in this situation 
are greedy and worldly; since my ill- health they have stolen and 
diverted most of my late husband`s properties to their private use. By 
God's grace, I will submit your name to this bank where my late husband 
deposited this money and confirm you as our family friend whom i wish 
this money to be transferred to.I will like you to forward this 
information below to enable introduce to the bank as the new beneficiary
 of the fund

1: Your Full Names

2: Your Contact address

3: Your Personal Contact Mobile

4: Marital Status

5: Age

6.; Occupation

I look forward to your quick reply and approval so that I will give you 
the contact of this bank and other necessary information for the 
transfer and I pray that God will give you health and courage to 
undertake this for me.

Thank you.

Yours truly,
Mrs. Vanessa Hernandez.
