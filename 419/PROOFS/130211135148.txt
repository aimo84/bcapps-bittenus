Dear Leanard=2C
Thank you for your interest in assisting me retrieve my money and disburse it to charity. I was married to my husband in 1985 and we never had any children. He died in an auto crash in Peru while on vacation in 1998 and ever since=2C I have not come to terms with his demise.  Because of the stage of the cancerous cells in me=2C I have been on chemotherapy for the past week and only returned yesterday to the Intensive Care Unit in Houston=2C Texas where I was able to quickly respond to your email and be placed on bed rest. The money to be retrieved from a UK based bank is $9=2C865=2C000.00 (Nine Million=2C Eight Hundred & Sixty-Five Thousand United States Dollars Only). Before we will proceed=2C I want you to send me your: 1.) Full name:2.) Address:3.) Telephone Number/Cell Number/ Fax With these information=2C my family lawyer can prepare the necessary paperwork that will enable the bank release the funds without any hitch. I would have been able to do this by myself but the doctors has advised that I be put to bed rest for God knows how long. I am attaching a picture of myself after the chemotherapy. Thank you and expecting a swift response from you=2CRegards=2CJulie Yolanda Witts.
