Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

My name is Mr Michael Osei . I am a manager in a financial institution. I
got your contact from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and The Ministry of
International Trade and Industry. I need your help to transfer US$12.5
Million dollars.

The money is part of the profits from our bank last year (2012). I have
already submitted annual report for last year to my bank headquarters in
Accra-Ghana, and they did not notice the excess profits. I deposited the
US$12.5 Million dollars in an escrow account without a beneficiary
(Anonymous) to avoid any trace.

I cannot be directly connected to this money because I still work with the
bank. So, I need your help to transfer this money to your country for me
and you to share. I offer you 45% of this money as my foreign partner and
55% would be for me. There is no risk involved because it will be a
bank-to-bank transfer.

All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this transaction
through. Should you be interested and willing to help Kindly complete your
detail below:

1. Your full name:..........................
2. Your occupation/position in office:..........................
3. Your date of birth:........
4. Marital status:.............
5. Nationality:.............
6. Your full contact addresses (Home/office):
7. Your International passport photo ID :.............
8. Your private telephone/fax:...............

Please for further information and enquiries feel free to contact me back
immediately for more explanation and better understanding through this
number +233246645667

Sincerely,

Mr Michael Osei
