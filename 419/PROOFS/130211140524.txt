Dear Brother,=20
=C2=A0=20
Greetings!=20
I must thank you first for your response. Please be contacting me through this my private box for security reasons.=20
The time frame is the best time to do the transaction because after the long years of absence, the bank has decided to transfer the fund to the treasury if unclaimed at the end of the fiscal year which will elapse around the end of this month, 2013 that is why everything has to be done speedily if you wish that we make a success in this transaction.=20
The owner of the said fund was a gold merchant from Germany and he got the money from the proceeds he made while he was mining in Sierra Leone before the war broke out there. I will give you further information about him later. My concern is for you to keep absolute secret. I have given you the details of the transaction hereunder to enable you know whether you can run the transaction with me.=20
Sorry that I did not respond immediately as you expected because I was putting things in order before getting back to you and also I was praying over the transaction because I do not want to get in to any wrong hand.=20
I do not know you before but your carefulness in responding to my mail interested me that is why I decided to give you all the details to know whether you can make the transaction with me. You do not need to worry on how to be the next of kin because it is what will be used in filling the application that matters. You can either be a next of kin or partner or anything depending on what I decide. No one is aware of this fund and again the deceased has no one coming again for the fund.=20
I want you to know that if you are serious towards this transaction, we are going to make a success.=20
You have to know whether you have the capacity to receive this money when transferred to your account but my concern is for you to maintain absolute=C2=A0 confidentiality.=20
The percentage is subject to review depending on your committment to help me with full devotion. I am also ready to do charity works with part of the fund after we have succeeded.=20
Be sure that you have no risks to fear about.=20
The guarantee is that I am working in the same bank and will also serve as an insider on your behalf.=20
I am sure also that no one is coming later to ask you whether you are the real next of kin or not because I studied every thing before contacting you and moreover, I cannot involve myself to danger in the same bank where I am working.=20
I see this as an opportunity for me to be great and I want you=C2=A0 also to be honest with me after the fund has been transferred to your account.=20
I want you to know that you were not the person I had in mind before sending out my message but another person that bears similar name like yours who was formerly living in my country but I couldn't get his email address when I searched for it and in place I got yours from the public sector information book through search.=20
=C2=A0 Don=E2=80=99t be afraid because I am here to give you all the guidelines required.=20
