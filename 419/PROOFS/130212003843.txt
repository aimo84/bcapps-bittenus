Dear Friend,

Many thanks for responding to my proposal.well,I must say that I have
enormous respect for you considering the manner in which I have made
contact with you.  I would go straight to the proposal at hand without
wasting much of your time. It is left for you to make up your mind if you
would go along with me in accomplishing this or not. If you do wish, then
please act as I have instructed. If not, please keep these details to
yourself and I promise to compensate you all the same as soon as the
transaction is concluded, as far as you stay in touch. I would respectfully
request that you keep the contents of this email confidential and respect
the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this email. I
contact you independently and no one is informed of this communication.

In 2008, the subject matter; (Late Alfred) came to our bank to engage in
business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that
he had a financial portfolio of $42 million United States dollars, which he
wished to have us invest on his behalf and I was appointed his private
banker/portfolio manager at the time.  I then provided numerous suggestions
and advise in line with my duties. Given the volume of funds he wished to
put into our bank, we met on numerous occasions prior to any investment
being placed. I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime
ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start by
assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternative
investments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various
opportunities and made very attractive profits margins during our first few
months of operation. The accrued profit and capital at this point stood at
over US$46 Million. He desired low risk and guaranteed returns on
investments, and as such we could not utilise the full potential of the
funds

In October 2008, he instructed that the portfolio be liquidated because he
needed to make urgent real estate investments requiring cash payments in
United Kingdom. We got in touch with a specialist bank who agreed to
receive this money for a fee and make cash available to Alfred.

Last month, I received a notice from the specialist bank notifying me that
as a policy, their bank was obliged to notify the originator of a transfer
in the event of such remaining dormant/unclaimed after 4 years. The $46
Million we had transferred on behalf of Alfred had sat in the bank for over
3 years untouched, without any instructions from him.

This was indeed shocking news for me considering the urgency he had
requested we make the transfer at the time.  Upon enquiry I found out that
he was involved in an accident in Mainland China and passed away only a few
weeks after the transfer was made to the specialist bank on his behalf.

As his personal banker, I used all information available to me from his
files and upon further enquiries discovered that the deceased died
intestate =96 In fact, he died without nominating a next of kin, or a
beneficiary for his estate in the event of the inevitable.

His records with us too show no next of kin and the reason I am writing you
is because you bear the same last name with him.

What I wish to relate to you may smack of unethical practice but I want you
to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who
finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of
private banking especially here in China, is fraught with huge rewards for
those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. What I
propose is that since you are a foreigner and I have exclusive access to
his file and the specialist bank was given instructions by me to receive
funds when we sought their assistance, you will be made the beneficiary of
these funds and the specialist/holding bank subsequently instructed to make
payment of the monies in their custody to you.

Nobody is getting hurt in this. As a banker here in China, we see so much
cash and funds being re-assigned daily. The alternative to this would be
that when my bank is notified, the Specialist Bank would be instructed and
the money reverts back to the state or embezzled by a corrupt top official
which is more likely to happen. I know that this may be hard for you to
understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move.
Such opportunities only come once in a lifetime and as personal banker to
the DECEASED and custodian to his files and all his information here, I
hold the KEY to these funds.  I want us to keep communication for now
strictly by the above  details.  Please, again, note I am a family man; I
have a wife and children. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one
accord, we should act swiftly on this.

I propose that upon successful completion of this deal, we will split the
proceeds according to a ratio to be agreed in subsequent communication
between us.

Finally, I thank you for taking the time to read this and look forward to
receiving a swift response from you (hoping you accept my offer to
participate in this once in a lifetime opportunity).

Yours Sincerely,

Mao Chen
