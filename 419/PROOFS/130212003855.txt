Dear Friend=2C

Let me start by introducing myself.I am Dr Liu Tang director of operations of the State Bank Of India.I have an obscured business suggestion for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman=2C made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months=2C with a value of( $16 million=2C Sixteen million US dollars) only in my branch.Upon maturity several notices was sent to him=2Ceven during the war which began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no  response came from him. We later found out that the General along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit their home. After further investigation it was also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So=2C( $16 million=2CSixteen million US dollars ) is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 15 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Indian Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop=2C my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that you will be able to receive his funds.

After you have been made the next of kin=2C the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in this matter=2C as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall then share in the ratio of 70% for me=2C 30% for you.
