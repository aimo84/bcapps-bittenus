Attn: Mr. Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thank you for your email response to this transaction i have brought to
your notice. Like i said i am newly posted to this office and during my
investigation i discovered that so official initially handling your
transaction has connived with a business man named Mr. Remy Bouzard to
claim your fund without your knowledge due to the fact that United Nations
and World Bank has decided to step in and resolve some of the financial
problems facing the world today.

As it is now, 7.1 Million British pound has been approved and mapped out to
be transferred to your nominated bank account anywhere in the world, but we
have problem because Mr. Remy Bouzard submitted a power of attorney and a
sown affidavits claiming to be acting on your behalf. After looking at the
process of which Mr. Bouzard has used to submit the legal documents i
became doubtful of his claim and decided to contact you directly.

Mr. Zeptowitz, as it is now there is urgent need for you to forward your
full details to me so that we can start the procedure to stop their claims
otherwise they will claim your rightful inherited fund which has been in
the UK bank for sometime. I will do everything within my power to make sure
i help in this regards, all i need is your sincerity and honesty.

As soon as i have your details i shall proceed with the legal requirements
to secure this fund to your bank account

Please feel free to call me and also ask any further questions
+447700067842

Best Regards
Griffin Philip
