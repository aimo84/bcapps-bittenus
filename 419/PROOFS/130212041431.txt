Attention: Leonard Zeptowitz,
=A0

Thanks for your feedback, I would like to confirm good receipt of your email In order to proceed in full confidence and complete trust, would you be so kind to provide me with your full account detail where you would like the fund to be transferred, it can be an EMPTY account provided its active and you are the only signatory to the account. I will also like you to assure me that you will not let me down either now or in the future as I strongly hope to establish a strong long lasting business relationship with you. On this ground we can proceed in complete trust. From here I can then, on your instructions, process the transfer of the fund to any destination you requested. Further more I would like you to assist us in areas of investment. I would like to invest my own share of the fund on real estate or any viable project.
=A0

I would also like to stress that in this kind of transaction one must possess the ability to start and close deal very fast. Hence you should give priority attention to this transaction. The fund for transfer is of non drug, terrorist or criminal related. As such this transaction is 100% free of risk and trouble.
=A0

Until his death he was the Manager of GOLDRIDGE INVESTMENT [UK] He held this account with a prime bank were I work. I work with this bank, ANGLO IRISH BANK PLC.
=A0

State your account details as follows:
=A0

Bank Name:......
Bank Address:.....
A/C No:...............
A/C Holder:........
Home Address:......
Phone Number:......
=A0

On receipt of the above information and a strong assurance from you that my trust and confidence in you is not misplaced, I will then start to process the transfer of the fund to your account without further delay. I will forward an application for the release of the said amount on your behalf to the bank. I will also forward your account detail to the bank and to the Ministry of Finance for Foreign Transfer Approval in your favor. So as soon as the fund is approved for transfer to your account.

After the Approval from the bank the fund will be transferred to your account and you will call your bank to confirm receipt of the fund in your account. On confirmation of the successful transfer of the fund to your account, I will fly over with the next available flight to meet you up so that I can go back with you to your Bank for sharing and investment as I stated in my first letter of proposal.
=A0

After the proper sharing of the first transfer of =A36 Million without any dissappointment on your side, we will be together in your country and I will have the remaining balance of =A3100 Million transferred to your account and we will also share the same as I stated earlier.
=A0

At moment you should not tell your bank that large amount is to be transferred into your account until after we have gotten all the documents to back up the transfer as a legitimate fund which does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act will be ready in your name and will accompany the fund to your account so that your bank or your government will not question the transfer.
=A0

I would like to receive in return your acceptance to proceed as suggested. Urgency is indeed needed. Looking forward to a mutual beneficial partnership and welcome you to England would be my great pleasure.
=A0

NOTE: This information is highly confidential and you should keep it only to yourself.
=A0

Yours faithfully,
Mr. Stephen Alvin.
