Re: Investment with S. L. International.

Dear Partner=2C
=20
Greetings
 to you and your family=2C thank you for your email. First of all=2C let me=20
introduce my company more elaborately. As you already known=2C I am Mr=20
Keith Skeoch=2C Chief Executive Director=2C Distribution and Client Service=20
of Standard Life International. Standard Life International is a=20
subsidiary of HST Investments and our contact details are provided=20
below. We offer investment consultation and advisory services. We are=20
based in Ireland and London=2C and we work in collaboration with companies
 in Europe and the Middle East to provide consultation to clients. I am=20
presently in London. Be advised to understand that this funds are not=20
yet in any bank account due to the fact that its has not yet been=20
approved for any investor.

Standard Life International is a=20
business consulting firm=2C offering business advisory services worldwide.
 We are not a very big company but we have recently been confronted with
 the task of investing funds exceeding our capacity and have decided to=20
seek partners to cooperate with us in investing the available funds=20
because we have never done business of this nature and huge amount.

We
 have suddenly be confronted with a huge investment of Twenty Five=20
Million pounds which has exceeded our capacity=2C that's why we are in=20
search of companies and individual investors=2C who are willing to help us
 in our search for a suitable environment to manage such funds. Our plan
 is to invest in fields such as Tourism=2C Real Estate=2C Establishing of=20
Factories=2C Transportation=2C Health care and Educational Centres. This is=20
because the investment funds are Twenty Five Million British Pounds and=20
can be spread into several fields. We would therefore need to receive=20
your advice about which of these fields will be lucrative in your=20
country.

Whatever investments we engage in=2C we want you to bear=20
in mind that we want the investments to be minimum-risk long-term=20
investments. The profit margin should be between 10 and 30% per annum.=20
We also intend to establish a company in your country after we have=20
agreed to the fields in which we can invest the funds=2C and with your=20
permission=2C we could appoint you as Managing Partner and Local Advisory=20
of the company whereas on behalf of my client I shall be Managing=20
Principal.

For this=2C I am aware that I need to visit your=20
country=2C but I can only visit your country and establish a company when=20
you have given us information about the investment climate in your=20
country and also confirmed the funds under your full control and also=20
ready for further investment purposes. Upon agreement as to how the=20
funds will be invested=2C I shall meet with you in your country to=20
establish a company=2C and after the company has been established=2C we=20
shall transfer the funds into your country in bits. Once the transfer=20
process is completed you shall be paid an initial commission of 10% of=20
the value of the investment funds=2C and it is the amount after you have=20
been paid your commission that will be considered as the investment=20
funds.

Bear in mind that our primary aims are to have a contact=20
or agent in your country that would guide and advise us as to the=20
markets that will be profitable=2C and help us to secure or receive the=20
investment funds in your country because you will be required to go to=20
any of the company Offshore Payment Offices to process the required=20
endorsement purpose before the transfer of the funds to your nominated=20
bank account for further investment purposes as I have informed you.

It
 is for this task that you shall be paid a commission and once this task
 is completed and a company formed=2C you shall be placed on a standard=20
salary with appropriate allowances from the income of the established=20
company. I want you therefore to consider the above and let me know the=20
capacity in which you deem possible to cooperate with us. Please note=20
