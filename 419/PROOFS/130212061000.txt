Dear Partner,

Good day to you partner, I am so glad that we are going to be doing this
together so please at all the times, I want you to believe and know that
this is a very serious issue. I am starting the process by getting a lawyer
to prepare documents in your name. What he will be doing is that he has to
prepare documents that make you the beneficiary of Late Mr. Alfred estate
regarding the said amount. This document will be backdated and signed as if
the late Alfred did it years ago when he came to my bank to invest money,
that in the event of anything happening to him, you be paid as his
beneficiary. It is this document I will include in the file as I submit it
to the board of my bank. When this is in file and submission is made to
board, meeting will then be held and board of my bank will now determine
how payment will be made. They will then instruct the specialist bank to
commence payment and then that is when the specialist bank will be getting
in touch with you.

Also at that stage, I will be relying on you to update me daily as access
to file and procedures will be out of my hand. I will be guiding you all
the way to make sure there are no delays whatsoever. I am sure we can
conclude everything within 2weeks.

Please note that as I said earlier the specialist bank will be getting in
touch with you without knowledge of communication between us. Please never
mention that we have communicated.

When the specialist bank begins contact with you, with the help of my
partner there, the process will be very easy and then the funds will be
paid to any account you choose to use. Do you have an account that can
receive that amount of money? How long have you run the account for? Has
that amount of funds gone in through that account before? Anyways,when the
transfer is done, the bank will be sending all the necessary original
inheritance and probate documents directly to your bank alongside the
transfer. You do not need to tell your bank anything. It is your bank that
will inform you when they have received the funds and all the covering
documents.

We will leave the funds in your account for at least 10 working days and
then I will come to your country and meet with you and your family. We
discuss and then we share money as agreed. I will then give you an account
where you will transfer our share into. What is your profession? I have
been working  at the bank for the last 20 years in investment sector. How
old are you.? I AM 67 YEARS. How large is your family? Do you have any
grandchildren? I have 4 sons, 2 daughters and seven grandchildren. Big
family. Please my friend I want us to work together. I want us to work as a
team.

I have been working on this for over a year now and I have checked that if
we do everything as planned without any enquiries, we will scale through.
The china economy is bursting up with so many investments that people do
high deals daily and scale through. I am very positive this will work but
only if you do as I say and obey instructions.

We will be communicating day to day till we get this to fruition so I will
be keeping you informed on what I do here on a daily basis so you can have
a clear picture. I have to start by getting a good private and reliable
solicitor who has been in practice for at least 20 years to do the
paperwork. I am happy to work with you and please respond to all
communications. What you do for hobby? I play golf. The late Alfred was a
golfer too. There is a Chinese saying that goes "Over long distance you
learn about the strength of horse and over time you learn about the
character of a friend" . My friend please know that i am following my chi
(mind) on this, I have no choice but to trust you,

Please know that my whole life, family and hope is on this. When the money
is paid to you, I am trusting that everything will be as we have agreed. I
will keep you informed with my progress in trying to find a solicitor.

I have decided to attach a copy of my staff ID to show my honesty and I
expect you to send me yours in your next correspondence to enable me have a
first-hand knowledge of whom I am dealing with.

Take care and my greetings to your family.

N.B:Please provide me with your cell phone number in your next
correspondence for a brief discussion on further relevant information.

Regards,

Mao Chen
