Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

I hope you would know the essence of my =0Acontact with you, and I sincerely promise that this deal is 100% =0Arisk-free to both sides; hence our top powers to execute it as =0Astipulated by the Inheritance Law; all I required from you is your full =0Aco-operation in all obligations and exhibition of a binding trust to the=0A accomplishment of this project and also to follow my instruction and =0Adirectives for the successful completion of this project as stipulated =0Aby the Law guiding Inheritance Estate Funds. The success of this =0Abusiness depends on our collective effort which may not be achieved =0Awithout our active support, participation and contributions and trust; I=0A hope that both of us will be able to work together in truth, sincerity,=0A trust and with one spirit.

Actually, the money was originally =0Adeposited by One of your nationality who=0A resided here in West Africa as an Engineer and a Contractor, and he =0Aexecuted a lot of contract down here in West Africa. So he made you the =0Abeneficiary of his Estate Legacy Fund that is why I communicated with =0Ayou to inform you about this issue so that you can receive this money =0Afrom the deposited Bank. The amount which is Eighteen Million, Seven =0AHundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars only (US$18.750,000.00) is now =0Adeposited in Republic of Togo with the Bank for safe keeping since your =0Alate relative had died with his family member.

You are to apply =0Afor the release and transfer of your Inheritance amount by following my =0Ainstruction and directive as I specified, let me introduce myself to =0Ayou, my name as you know already is Gaskin Hillary Appiah, the President=0A General and Senior Attorney to Jurisdiction Law Firm and Associate =0AChamber. I work as a Legal Adviser for a large French company operating =0Ain the distribution sector, and as a Council within an=0A audit financial firm in Togo so below are my personal and contact =0Ainformation:

Having=0A said this, I will now give you more comprehensive details as regards to=0A this project; the Inheritance Law as laid out in section 46 of the =0AAdministration of Estate Act of 1925/1999, states that Parents, =0Asiblings, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews brothers=0A and others are heirs for the purpose of distributing the estate of the =0Adeceased if he died intestate and if the deceased had no spouse or =0Achildren. So when a person dies without leaving a valid testament or =0Awill, the property (the estate) must be shared out according to certain =0Arules which are called the rules of intestacy. With this reason I =0Acontacted you to ensure that these funds shall be transferred into your =0Aaccount as the beneficiary of my late client since you are the only =0Aspecified relative attached to his properties as the the next of kin.

Understand=0A that if an applicant was not apply for the transfer of the Fund in a =0Aspecified period of time, the Bank will be compelled by the Law to hand =0Aover the Funds (as unclaimed deposit) to the Government of such Country.=0A Remember that the late client had no brother or sister who resided with=0A him all his life except His Wife and only Son who also died along with =0Ahim in the accident. The Funds will=0A be transfer to your family name; it's legally yours on positive proof =0Aof your identity. Understand that this transaction involves a huge =0Aamount of money and we have to do everything possible to save this fund =0Afrom the Federal Government, and we have a specified period of time to =0Acomplete this transaction.

In compliance with standard =0Arequirements of the federal disclosure and privacy laws which prohibit =0Aus from revealing certain privileged information without due process, we=0A intentionally left out certain information which we deemed proprietary =0Aat this point and to enable us double-check our record and ensure that =0Ayou are indeed the addressee of this letter. So forward to me your =0Apersonal information immediately for submission to the authorities =0Ainvolves, as we need you to reconfirm your information by providing us =0Awith the following information below about yourself:

1. Your full name
2. Your home or office address
3. Your correct=0A telephone number
4. Your age and Sex
5. Your occupation
6. Your passport or id card scan copy

All=0A these information are urgently needed to present you to the authorities=0A concerns and also to enable me swear an Affidavit of Claim in your name=0A with the Letter of Administration; so endeavor to sending it to me as =0Asoon as possible. Your information will be taken to the probate division=0A of the International Court of Justice for verification, after which I =0Awill submit your information to the Bank where the fund was deposited by=0A my late client.

Once I reconfirm your information and endorse =0Asame appropriately, we shall provide you with all the privileged =0Ainformation/legal documents relating to the deceased customer and his =0Aterm-deposit account, and also will give you guidelines on how we intend=0A to realize this goal without any bridge of the law.
