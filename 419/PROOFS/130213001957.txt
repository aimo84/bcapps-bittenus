Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

I hope you would know the essence of my contact with you, and I sincerely promise that this deal is 100% risk-free to both sides; hence our top powers to execute it as stipulated by the Inheritance Law; all I required from you is your full co-operation in all obligations and exhibition of a binding trust to the accomplishment of this project and also to follow my instruction and directives for the successful completion of this project as stipulated by the Law guiding Inheritance Estate Funds. The success of this business depends on our collective effort which may not be achieved without our active support, participation and contributions and trust; I hope that both of us will be able to work together in truth, sincerity, trust and with one spirit.

Actually, the money was originally deposited by One of your nationality who resided here in West Africa as an Engineer and a Contractor, and he executed a lot of contract down here in West Africa. So he made you the beneficiary of his Estate Legacy Fund that is why I communicated with you to inform you about this issue so that you can receive this money from the deposited Bank. The amount which is Eighteen Million, Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars only (US$18.750,000.00) is now deposited in Republic of Togo with the Bank for safe keeping since your late relative had died with his family member.

You are to apply for the release and transfer of your Inheritance amount by following my instruction and directive as I specified, let me introduce myself to you, my name as you know already is Gaskin Hillary Appiah, the President General and Senior Attorney to Jurisdiction Law Firm and Associate Chamber. I work as a Legal Adviser for a large French company operating in the distribution sector, and as a Council within an audit financial firm in Togo so below are my personal and contact information:

1. My Name: ====== HONORABLE BARRISTER GASKIN HILLARY APPIAH
2. My Position: ====== BARRISTER-AT-LAW (CDF, LLM. BL)
3. My Chamber's name: ====== JURISDICTION LAW FIRM AND ASSOCIATE CHAMBER
4. My Chamber Registration Number: ====== GA092413/TG

9. Private email address: ======g.hillary.appiah@lawyer.com

Having said this, I will now give you more comprehensive details as regards to this project; the Inheritance Law as laid out in section 46 of the Administration of Estate Act of 1925/1999, states that Parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews brothers and others are heirs for the purpose of distributing the estate of the deceased if he died intestate and if the deceased had no spouse or children. So when a person dies without leaving a valid testament or will, the property (the estate) must be shared out according to certain rules which are called the rules of intestacy. With this reason I contacted you to ensure that these funds shall be transferred into your account as the beneficiary of my late client since you are the only specified relative attached to his properties as the the next of kin.

Understand that if an applicant was not apply for the transfer of the Fund in a specified period of time, the Bank will be compelled by the Law to hand over the Funds (as unclaimed deposit) to the Government of such Country. Remember that the late client had no brother or sister who resided with him all his life except His Wife and only Son who also died along with him in the accident. The Funds will be transfer to your family name; it's legally yours on positive proof of your identity. Understand that this transaction involves a huge amount of money and we have to do everything possible to save this fund from the Federal Government, and we have a specified period of time to complete this transaction.

In compliance with standard requirements of the federal disclosure and privacy laws which prohibit us from revealing certain privileged information without due process, we intentionally left out certain information which we deemed proprietary at this point and to enable us double-check our record and ensure that you are indeed the addressee of this letter.

Your information will be taken to the probate division of the International Court of Justice for verification, after which I will submit your information to the Bank where the fund was deposited by my late client.

Once I reconfirm your information and endorse same appropriately, we shall provide you with all the privileged information/legal documents relating to the deceased customer and his term-deposit account, and also will give you guidelines on how we intend to realize this goal without any bridge of the law.
