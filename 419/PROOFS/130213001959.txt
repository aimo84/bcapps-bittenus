Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

I can understand that you have been taken by surprise, but this is not the first time we have dealt with something similar.It is true that we do not know each other=20
before, I found myself in this opportunity and had no option than to give out this blind trust by contacting you for this transaction.I want you to know that I did not=20
just wake up and decide to do this, I did my proper home work before contacting you and I want to assure you that this is not a joke.I have worked with this bank=20
for over 15yrs now so if I am not sure that this transfer will work, I would not have thought of doing it.

With your co operation,I am going to ensure that all adequate measures are in place to ensure the speedy transfer of this funds Euro16,500,000 million in the=20
custody of Groupe Bank of Africa CI. (BOA) Cote D'ivoire to your account.I would want to re affirm that my intentions are in the right places.

I see this as an alluring opportunity for us to get this funds rather than having the bank officials confiscate and share it if no ones comes for it.All i have to do is=20
to remain at the background and be directing you on what to do.You will be reaching the bank as the said beneficiary without me and without mentioning my=20
name to avoid any eyebrows since i am a staff.

This late customer died leaving no WILL behind and as i mentioned above,what is going to happen now is that the bank may possibly confiscate the fund he=20
deposited if nobody comes up to claim it. In fact my branch has been served a notice to this effect.Since you share the same name with this depositor,what i am=20
going to do is present you to the bank here as his next of kin because in his account file there is no next of kin.The fund is held in a coded suspense account=20
and I have all the access information which I will give to you thereafter.When the money will be transferred, it will be labeled as inheritance so there will not be=20
any problem with any government authorities.

This transfer will be done under the legitimate (BOA) Bank Transfer Order of my country and are going to be coordinated by me and shall conform to all the laws=20
and principles of international bank to bank wire transfer.All I want from you is your honesty and to be steadfast all through.I am proposing a 50:50 sharing ratio=20
between us. After the transfer, I will come over to your country to take my own share of the money and invest with you in any good profitable ventures.

Please I need you to send me immediately details of your full names,date of birth and your address,there are provisions where it will be filled here in the account=20
form to make changes of the initial ownership of the account in your own name to enable the fund remittance in your favor.

Upon receiving this information from you, I will change all the ownership guarantees of the Account in your name as the fund beneficiary to enable you contact=20
the holding bank here with the application i will forward to you which you will copy and return to the bank here requesting them to transfer the funds to your=20
account. In fact this will be mere formality as i would have arranged all the necessary back ups to ensure that the funds is released to you.

However please because of the short time ,i want to re emphasis on the need for us to try and speed up the process and also to keep every information relating=20
to the transaction strictly between us until the whole process is completed.

As soon as I have confirmation from you that the funds are in your account ,I will make arrangements for my travel to meet you for disbursement.For all=20
concern, I will prefer we communicate only through this particular email address for security reasons.As i wrote earlier,I cannot in any way handle this=20
transaction by myself since i am a staff of the bank so this has to remain strictly confidential between us to avoid raise of eyebrow or necessary exposure=20
when the funds is remitted to you.

All correspondence regarding this transaction between both of us should only be through this particular email address (steven.banny2012@yahoo.fr).For any=20
urgent concern, call me on my Telephone number; +225 44 04 93 34

Once more thank you and I hope I really can count on you.

Sincerely yours,

Steven Banny
