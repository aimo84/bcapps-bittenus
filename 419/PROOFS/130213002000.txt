Good day=2C

My Beloved sorry for my late response it was due to my present health conduction=2C I am Mrs. Sabah Halif a citizen of Kuwait but currently residing in the United Kingdom. I was married to late Mamuod Halif of blessed memory who was an Oil Explorer in Kuwait & Russia for twelve years before he died in the year 2000. We were married for twelve years without a child=3B he died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Since his death=2C I too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid problems. When my late Husband was alive he deposited a substantial amount of money worth $19.5Million with a bank in the United Kingdom which I inherited after his death.

Recently=2C my doctor told me that I have only 3 months to live due to my ailment. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a charity/orphanage home or devoted God fearing individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct therein. I want this organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund charity homes (Motherless Homes)=2C orphanages=2C and widows.

I took this decision because I don=92t have any child that will inherit this money and my husbands relatives are into radical organization as an unbeliever=92s which I don=92t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner=2C hence the reasons for this bold decision. Please=2C pray for me to recover as your prayers will go a long way in uplifting my spirit.

I don=92t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health condition which has seriously affected my speech and also because of the presence of my husband=92s relatives around me always. I don=92t want them to know about this development.

As soon as I receive your reply=2C I shall give you further directives on what to do and how to go about actualizing this project. I will also instruct my lawyer to file an application on your behalf to the bank where the funds were deposited for the transfer of the money to you for this purpose. I want you to always pray for me.

Any delay in your reply will give room in sourcing for an organization or a devoted Individual for this same purpose.

Until I hear from you by email=3B my dreams will squarely rest on your shoulders. Remain Blessed.

Yours truly=2C
Mrs. Sabah Halif.
