As i said early, =0Athe approval legal documents of the said fund will be secured/obtained =0Ain your name as the true beneficiary receiver. I have instructed my =0Aattorney to prepare a power of attorney and sworn affidavit of change of=0A ownership in your favor to enable a hitch free transfer of the funds =0Adirect into your bank account which you will provide.

As a matter=0A of fact, the said fund has=0A been approved by the Federal Government of Nigeria only awaiting to =0Areceive the=0A beneficiary's full data to enable them commence process on the said =0Afund transfer, therefore, you have nothing to worry about, as everything=0A will go under legal process but all i need from you is your maximum =0Asupport and financial assistance as i have spent all my money to make =0Athis transaction came up to this stage of approval for transfer.
