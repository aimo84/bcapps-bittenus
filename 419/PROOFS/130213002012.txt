Hello Leonard,=0AThanks for your response.=0AMy letter to you was written as a matter of last resort because of the circumstances surrounding this claim. Mr. Andrew=C2=A0Zeptowitz=C2=A0was a wine farmer and he was exporting wine around Europe and Asia. He died in 2007 at the age of 54, alongside with his wife and their only daughter.I am not too sure you are actually related to him because we have since carried out numerous searches on his actual extended family ties and which efforts have been to no avail.I am contacting you to solicit your honest assistance in getting these funds belonging to my late client.I want you to consider the details so you could understand the full reasons I need your co-operation. Mr. Andrew=C2=A0Zeptowitz=C2=A0lived most of his years here in Capetown. I served as his private Investment Manager in the last eight years preceding his death and I had known the family a little while before then.Mr. Andrew migrated to South Africa long time ago and I never knew or met his father. He is
 referred to as the Late Mr. Antonio who died in Scotland long time ago. I contacted you because after the death of my late client, I was informed by the Bank to search for any member of his extended family to put up a claim, or whom could be so represented as Charterer=E2=80=99s/ Trustees for his deposited funds with them (BANK) which stands at over ($22M) Twenty Two Million Dollars plus accrued interest this is owing to the fact that he died with his immediate family members.=0A=0AI was given an ultimatum in August 2012 to look for his beneficiary to come for the claim or have the funds liquidated in accordance with existing laws because it will be assumed that no member of his family is alive. However, it might interest you to know that,I am not able to locate any of my late clients beneficiary to make the claim, the fund will be reverting to the Government as unclaimed Inheritance. Upon discovery of this plan couple with professional consideration on my part, I decided to look for someone credible, with the same last name as my late client, to apply for this claim. I have in my possession legal documents which are vital to this claim. I want you to be rest assured that this project is legal and risk free, all legal documents that will enable you to make the claim is available at my disposal.This is a life changing project that I am offering you and I want you to know that it requires a great mind to understand this project I
 believe you are mature enough which is the reason I am going further. I am taking my time to explain all these for you to understand and decide if you are still interested.This transaction has to be kept really confidential in order for us to be able to achieve our goals.=0A=0ANOTE When we proceed , if they( Bank) request to know how you came to know that your family member Andrew=C2=A0Zeptowitz=C2=A0had such an amount of funds with them and who contacted you, which I am not sure they will ask, but in order to be on the safe-side, if you are asked, be confident to tell them that your extended family discovered some documents in his archives showing that Mr. Andrew lodged such funds with them and that is why you have been sent by the paternal family to contact the bank. Anyway, further deliberations will be held on this as we proceed.=C2=A0=0AI want you to know I am in possession of the death certificate of Mr. Andrew=C2=A0Zeptowitz=C2=A0including some other document as proof and I will release them to you as soon as I have attained your confidence, maybe after we speak on phone.
