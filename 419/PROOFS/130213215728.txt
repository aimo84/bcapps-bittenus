My Dear Friend=2C
I want you inform that what i mean by my email is that i won cash prize and BMW Car and was deliver to me after i sent the Tax Payment okay.
 I paid 855pounds through western union and a receipt was sent to me later which i use to confirm my car on point of delivery.So if you are scared they are scam=2CMy advise is that they are not and they are Legit Lottery Board.If they have ask you for Tax payment hurry and send to them so they start processing your prizes.They transfer my cash to my account within 36hrs and car came to me within 12 days.
Once again i'm so happy because my life has change for good and if you are a winner like me then Congratulations to you too.
Once again i advise you comply with their Rules and be a happy man.
Thanks=2CJames Kings
