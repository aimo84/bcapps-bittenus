Hello Dear Friend ,=0A=0A=0AThanks for your mail .=0A=0APardon me for not having the pleasure of knowing your mindset before making you this offer and it is utterly confidential and genuine by virtue of its nature. I cannot imagine the surprise this will bring to you, but please be rest assured that it is with good faith and intentions from a friend in dare need of your assistance.=0A=0AAs you already know, I am Mr. Edmund Poon, director of the operations of operations of CITIC Bank International, Hong Kong.I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication. I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.=0A=0AI have a secured business proposal for you;=0A=0ABefore the plane crash of Macedonia 's President and his aides on February 26th, 2004, our client, Mr. Dimka Ilkovska-Boskovic, who was a member of President Boris Trajkovski's cabinet advisers, and also a business man, made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of 105,000,000.00 EUR (One Hundred & Five Million Euros Only) in my branch.=0A=0A=C2=A0=0AAfter further investigation, it was discovered that Mr. Dimka Ilkovska-Boskovic did not declare any next of kin in his official documentations including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one knew of his deposit in my bank. So, 105,000,000.00 EUR is still lying in my bank, and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of this country at the expiration of Eleven (11) years, the funds will be reverted to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody comes forward to claim the funds.=0A=0AIf you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died intestate.=0A=0AWhat I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. You should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose.=0AAgainst this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Dimka Ilkovska-Boskovic, so that you will be able to claim the funds in question.=0A=0AOur bank is simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward. This is the situation.=0A=0AI will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you.=0AI want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful.=0A=0AThere is no risk involved at all in the matter, as we are going to adopt a legalized method and an attorney will prepare all necessary legal documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account, we shall share in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you.=0A=0AI would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you within a few days. I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer I will then officially communicate with firm and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder.=0A=0AShould you be interested, please send me the following information below:=0A=0A(i) Full Names=0A(ii) Current Residential Address=0A(iii) Country of Origin=0A(iv ) Telephone Number=0A( v ) Present Occupation=0A( vi ) Age=0A=0A=0AI am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. If my offer is of no appeal to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you.=0A=0A=0ASuch opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by, for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.=0A=0A=0AIf you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through this email address.
