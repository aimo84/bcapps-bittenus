Dearest  Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thanks for your mail and your understanding I here with in receipt of your
response and as you rightly know I contacted you in this matter base on the
fact that you bear the same surname with my late client and of the same
nationality since I had sought for the relatives without success and
instead of this fund being confiscated by the Finance Firm as I did
mentioned in my previous letter or being claimed by some unscrupulous
person as well. I however, apologize for my interference into your privacy
as this was done out of my desire to locate a sincere and trustworthy
individual who can guarantee the confidence needed in this matter and with
due respect and honor.

As a matter of fact, you should note that all the original documents that
will be needed in a transaction of this nature ascertaining you as the
confide beneficiary and next of kin to my late client will duly and legally
be obtained and issued in your name and favor. I do not know you but I feel
you will be human enough to be honest to me at least for bringing you into
a deal capable of fetching something tangible to both parties. I have done
everything possible to trace the relatives of my late client without any
luck, most of his properties here were vandalized by hoodlums and some over
grown by weeds as there is no one to look after them.

It was until the finance firm with the said deposit invited me to their
office and mandated me as his personal attorney here in Republic of Togo to
locate and present to them his next of kin for the release of his
outstanding fund with them, the total sum of Seven Million Five Hundred
Thousand United States Dollars only (US$7,500,000.00). It's upon this that
I decided to contact you as bearing the same surname in order to assist me
in putting claims to this fund for the release and transfer of this fund.
Of course, I know that you might not be related or even know the late
client but as I really made a thorough inquiry and was convinced that he
had non known living relative as I understood that he came to Togo sometime
in 1950s as an orphan through the help of the missionary.

Note that the next of kinship as stated by the inheritance law, is not
limited to relations of the deceased nor is it confided to the circuit of
parental relationship, rather it is by choice of the benefactor as regards
to whom he wish to will it to as beneficiary, either formally by write up,
or informally by secret information disclosure to beneficiary, be him / her
business partner, relation, kinsmen, friends or well wisher, therefore by
virtue of the above stated, I seek consent to present you as the next of
kin to my late client since the supposed next of kin also died along with
him which is his only son and wife.

In a situation of this kind, it's not published and the respective
financial institution only informs the customer's attorney as the case may
be and then only wait for the real heir to show up as the availability of
such funds are expected to be in he late "customer's will " which would be
the only source of knowledge of it by anybody who is entitle to such estate
but the real heir was also involved in the accident as noted. If this fund
is not claimed, it will be re-deposited into the treasury of the finance
firm as unclaimed bill which will be shared among the board of directors or
return back to the government of such country due to high level of
corruption here and that will become history.

There is nothing to worry about as everything is legal with documentations,
it is my duty to provide the next of kin and whosoever I approve as the
next of kin will become the beneficiary and receive the fund. The most
important issue to be considered now is trust and confidence in this matter
hence I plead this should be our watch word throughout this transaction and
I can fully assure you on my own part that as much as I work this with you,
I will always remain the same. You have to furnish me with your full
information as I requested below such as:

1. Your full name
2. Your home or office address
3. Your correct telephone number
4. Your age and Sex
5. Your occupation (profession) and Position
6. Your passport or id card scan copy

This will enable me go to the concerned Authority to legally and officially
present you as the sole next of kin to my deceased client in order to
expedite the necessities for the immediate release of the deposit amount
into your account in your country as the beneficiary. I would also advise
that you call me immediately upon the receipt of this mail on my direct
telephone number (+228-98406805) for further clarification regarding the
above.

Contact this law office immediately with your full information as requested
for more information and to begin the legal process of redeeming your
lawful entitlement before the Bank is compelled by law to hand over the
money to the government of this Country as we waiting for your urgent reply.

Best regards.

Yours faithfully,
Honorable Gabby Lucky
