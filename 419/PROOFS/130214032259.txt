THE TRUTH NEEDED IS SINCERITY

Thanks for your response to my e-mail and I am willing to do what I stated
in my mail to you.Well let me tell you, I am a man of honor, God fearing
and respect for human dignity. I have never disappointed anybody before
both in my chosen career as a Government Official and in my community as
one of the main leaders. I am really sure of what I will do to get this
payment approved, we have come to notice the loop holes from the contract
attestation report document and fund ownership certificate which were not
in your name, but I will work on all these and perfect them to your name
before I will send my report to the president for him to raise an
irrevocable payment approval on the payment to your favorite perfection of
the whole documents which will take me at list 2 days to get it done.

I will like you to send me your banking details and your mailing address to
enable me start the process of the vital document on your name.Immediately
your banking details. I will start now by going to the various ministries
as I told you because your name has to appear in all the departments and I
have to get the documents back dated. And I will be sending you by
attachments all the documents procured on your behalf for your perusal.

Meanwhile, I will backdate some of the document procure, like Attestation
report letter which will give us opportunity for the presidential security
transfer form. I quite believe that what should matter between us is just
matter of understanding only.

I Wait for your quick respond

Best Regards
Dr. Usman  Hassan
