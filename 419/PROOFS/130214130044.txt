Dear Friend,

I received your email and assure you once more about the legitimacy of this
transaction as we are going to follow all the official and legal procedures
to get all approvals in your favour as the beneficiary.

During our auditing in the bank, I discovered that the account has been
dormant and the bank recommended that after this fiscal year, the fund will
be transferred to the apex bank as unclaimed bills and this warranted my
search for a honest person who will apply for the fund and claim it so that
we share it together as I indicated in my previous mail.

I have worked here in the bank for a period of time now without achieving
anything that is why when I saw this opportunity, I decided to utilize it.
I contacted you to champion this project on my search for a reliable
partner and my secretary, Miss Megg, gave me your email as I instructed her
to give an email of a reliable foreigner for these important transaction
and I am sure she got it from the computer.

However, this transaction will be strictly based on the following terms and
conditions as I have stated below:

(a)  My conviction of your transparent honesty and diligence.

(b) That you would treat this transaction with utmost secrecy and
confidentiality it deserves.

(c) That you will not ask for more percentage or try to sit on the funds
once it is under your custody, or any form of blackmail to allow you take
the money alone.

(d) That upon receipt of the funds you will release the funds as instructed
by me after you have removed your share from the total amount before my
arrival in your country as it might take me little time to retire and get
my travel documents ready before arriving in your country.

This transaction is 100% legal and risk free and we hope to conclude it
deal within 7-14 working days if you accord me your unalloyed support and
co-operation. I give you my word that you are completely safe in doing
business with me.

After the processing of all Foreign Payment documents, and when the money
is ready to be paid into your A/C, after the final Approval in your favour
by the finance ministry, you be required to come in person to sign the
change of beneficiary documents. We can as well engage an attorney if you
are unable to come, but I will appreciate if you make it possible to be
here as that will also be an opportunity for us to know each other and
build more confidence before the fund enters your account. You should know
that this opportunity can hardly come my way again in life so I have
planned everything very well so be rest assured that everything will work
out fine.

Frankly speaking from the bottom of my heart, my fear now is the security
of this money in your custody once transferred into your A/C because I
don't know you nor your capability and facilities to handle this large
amount. What is your age and profession? I will really like to know more of
you and I will want you to keep it very confidential at all times and also
to be maintaining constant communications with me knowing that this
transaction should take precedence over any other for the mean time.

Now I need the A/C information and your private telephone numbers as a need
may arise either to call you in the day or night as occasion warrants. Pls
follow this chart;
Your Name:
Bank Name:
Bank Address:
A\c Nos.:Swift Code(if any):

Personal information:
Contact Address:
Phone:
Fax:

Pls respond as quickly as possible with your account information to enable
us put an application to the bank for the approval processes in your favour
as the beneficiary.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,
Mr. Sawadougou Compaore.
