Hello, leonard

How are you today?  Am Glad you indicated interest in this joint venture and I know that we are going to make a very good partners as time goes on if your project plan is good.=20

My name is Moses Martins, an Algerian living in England, am also a financial consultant by profession, married to my beautiful wife and also blessed with three kids as well, my client is also an Algerian politician, a very successful man and I have known him for 18 years, he is seeking to invest in your country since the turmoil in our country early last year made it unsafe for him, due to the level of uncertainty and unpredictability in that region since last year. Actually he wanted to invest in United Kingdom which is where I am now, but I advised him against that, because investment here at the moment does not yield good profit, although the economy is somehow stable and predictable.

He is interested in a Joint Venture partnership with you acting as the manager and sole controller of the investment while he remain a silent investor for a period of ten years though he is only looking at investment opportunities within the range of =C2=A35.2M and above for a start.

I will be working closely with my investment manager to supervise every step, so please could you provide me with a workable business/project plan on the available amount, to enable my investment manager and I, study it before we take our final decision.

Further more, I will require the following information from you.

1-Introduction and description of your company.

1.1-Your Full name

1.2-Your Home/Office address

1.3-Your phone/mobile numbers

1.4-The Type of business that you are running and sector of activities

1.5-The exact amount you require for the stated/intended projects.

2-Investment Concern.
Please Specify the sector of investment of your interest (indicate if you have more than one choice in mind)=20

3-Budget and volume of investment projected by your company.
Please specify the volume budget that you require for this investment in GBP currency.
