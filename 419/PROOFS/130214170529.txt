Dear Beloved=2C
=20
=20
May=0A Almighty God blessing be with you and your family=2C He will give you =0Agrace to do his work with wisdom. My name is Mrs. Bahira Mohammed Mahdi =0Aand I am married to Late MR MOHAMMED MAHDI who worked with the AMERICAN =0AEMBASSY in Lome for 14 years and also the owner of MAHDI'S Oil company =0Ahere in Republic of Togo before He died in the year 2011.We have married=0A for 37 good years before my late husband sudden death without any child=0A as God have it.

I want to go straight to the point =0Abecause I am becoming weaker a very day. I am mailing you from the =0Aoffice of my Medical Doctor {Dr. Mark Anthony}=2C I have confide on him=2C I=0A did explained a bit about my situation to him but not everything=2C He =0Agave me the access to his office computer when he is less-busy just to =0Ahelp me communicate with you because I told him I want to get out from =0Athis hospital to abroad for more better medical treatment.

We=0A were in marriage for many years without any child and after the Death =0Aof my husband=2C I lost every of our properties even our MAHDI'S Oil =0Acompany was sold to Italian Businessman without my notice by my husband =0Arelationship=2C all because i have no child for my late husband. Before =0Athe death of my husband he deposited the $6.7 million USD in bank with =0Amy name as the next of Kin. Now i want you to help me stand as my =0Abusiness associate to claim this money to your country bank account and =0Ainvite me to your country for better medical treatment after the money =0Ais transferred because i need a better health care. Be informed that =0Anobody knows about this money except me alone and for security reason i =0Aadvise you to keep this transaction between me and you because this =0Amoney is my last hope on earth and i don't want my late husband brothers=0A to know about this money as their eyes is on my husband wealth.

Last=0A two weeks my doctor  confirmed to me during my last medical =0Aexaminations that I will not live more than 2 year from now and this is =0Awhy I have to take this bold step of transferring the fund to you now i =0Aam still a life so that I can fly abroad to consult a specialist for my =0Ahealth. I have promise my God Almighty that part of the money will be =0Agiven Orphanage Center and for the Helping of Widows and the Less =0APrivileged in the society. Before the death of my husband=2C we were both =0Aphilanthropist and we have been engaged in helping Orphanage Center and =0AWidows around the world. So=2C if you are willing to receive the fund as =0Ahas been specified above=2C you should use it in helping orphanage =0Acenters=2C Helping Widows and the less privileged around the world. As =0Asoon as you receive the fund in your account=2C you are only required to =0Atake 30% out of the fund as a token gift for your efforts and 30% will =0Abe my medical treatment while the remaining 40% for the purpose as I =0Ahave explained to you above for the help of humanity and finally to =0Afulfill the good wishes of my Late Husband.

If you need to speak =0Awith me on phone=2C you can let me know so that I will give you my =0Adoctor=92s telephone number but I do not need telephone conversation all =0Athe time because of the presence of my late husband's relatives around =0Ame always even here in the hospital and I do not want them to know =0Aanything about the existence of this fund because I do not want my =0Ahusband's hard earned money to be misused without using it for the =0Apurpose he instructed me before his death. Although the Doctor has =0Aconfirm that i have less than 2 more years to live on earth but i still =0Abelieved in my God that I will not die and i pray that our knowing =0Atogether will bring brighter future. Even though marriage will come out =0Aof this relationship as God desire=2C no problem.

Please i need=0A your assurance after reading this mail that you will not betray me =0Aafter this transfer and also assure me that you will not disclose this =0Atransaction to any other third party because i am afraid of people may =0Atell this transaction to my husband relative=2C remember that this money =0Ais the only thing i have benefited from my marriage after 37 years of =0Amarriage. Although my husband blessed memory will never be happy with =0Ahis brother's behavior towards me even at my sick bed.
