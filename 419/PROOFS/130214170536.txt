Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

I am glad with your honest reply and may the Almighty bless you as you read this letter.

I have carefully read your email note and need you to know that I have not contacted you with any foul intentions or plans to hurt you or any members of your family as I do have very strong feeling that you will sincerely carry out the charity mission with a genuine heart to help poor homeless children and needy to. I have always asked God in my prayers to lead me to the chosen one for this mission and I have decided to make this donation.=20

Presently, I'm on bed rest for over two weeks in a hospital, where I'm receiving medical treatment and a particular nurse here has been of tremendous help with the assistance of emailing you. Getting a cancer diagnosis is probably one of the most devastating things a person has to experience in life and my condition has really deteriorated. The stage mine has attained is worse because it has affected my speech and vocal ability. I am gradually becoming weaker as each day passes by and all what I desire to do now is to donate this fund to you by giving authorization to the bank where the funds are deposited through my lawyer, this would enable the bank identify you as the beneficiary of my deposits in their custody.=20

I am being checked frequently by physicians who monitor my health progress and response to treatment. My ailment was diagnosed very lately but I still pray for miracle to happen so that I can live. Nevertheless, I ask that you take 30% from the principal amount of the donation for your family upkeep and willingness to achieve my desire for me, and you should use the remaining 70% for the intended charity work. I need you to assure me that you will make judicious use of these funds to establish a charity legacy that will be forever cherished and remembered by people who benefit from it through you. This has been my dream ever since I was told that I have not much time to stay here until I go to meet my Heavenly Father in Heaven, I am not afraid of death because I know where I am going after here so I truly want my dreams to be accomplished. Another request that I wish to make is that you set up a charity foundation under the umbrella name of GOD=92s UNLIMITED LOVE or under your desired charity name since you=92ll oversee its affairs and build a small charity home for it in my memory as I will desire this so much.

Attached is a photo of me, I will be delighted to see the picture of you as well. I ask that you please keep this quite confidential because of the kind of the world we live in today and I do not want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner, in case any thing happens to me tomorrow as well, what I require of you is your honesty, trust and sincerity because God has been faithful to me.

God bless you and your family.

Yours Sincerely,

Marianne Mays
