Dear Partner,=20
=C2=A0=20
Thanks for your kind reply and also as regards to my proposition, be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free , All you need to do is to comply with my instructions so that you will not make any mistake when we start. Beside I have all the vital information=E2=80=99s concerning this transaction as well.=20
=C2=A0=20
Firstly, let me introduce myself briefly to you. I am 54 years old, married with four children. I have been working with this Bank for over twenty-five years now. I strongly believe that with my experience, nothing can stop us from achieving our desired to end within 10 working days immediately we start.=20
=C2=A0=20
However, the name of the deceased customer is Mr, Rudi Harmanto, an Indonesia nationality, but nationalized here for years before he died in the Indonesia/India Tsunami Disaster on 26th December 2004.=20
=C2=A0=20
I was his account officer for many years before his death. The man was a contractor and the major supplier of agricultural equipments in West Africa then. I have spent my time, made all the necessary inquires to find out if I can get his Next of Kin or any of his relative to come forward and claim his fund left behind in our Branch for many years, but all efforts proved abortive.=20
=C2=A0=20
It was during this search that I found out that his Next of Kin died along with him in the Indonesia/India Tsunami Disaster incident, leaving no one to claim his fund left in our branch. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than (9) years because the Bank will transfer it to the Bank's treasury as an abandoned or unclaimed fund.=20
=C2=A0=20
Truly, it was after this discovery, that I decided to contact you and use your name for the claim of this fund, consequence upon the fact that I do not want the fund to be transferred into our Bank=E2=80=99s treasury as an abandoned or unclaimed fund.=20
=C2=A0=20
Many Banks in Africa, confiscates lots of fund amounting to millions yearly and 95% of it, belongs to foreigners. These funds are been shared among the top shareholders and CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS of the Bank. We Poor employees do not gain anything out of these confiscated funds.=20
=C2=A0=20
I got this opportunity and decided to contact you, for the mutual benefit of our both families and for the fact that I do not want the money to go into the Bank=E2=80=99s treasury as usual. Because it will later be shared among these greedy CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS and top shareholders of the Bank. Normally, this transaction has to undergo normal Banking procedures of transferring inheritance fund.=20
=C2=A0=20
I will draft an application letter, which you will fill detailed information and apply as his business associate. I will be here as your partner in the business to guide you on what to do until the Bank transfers the money into your account.=20
