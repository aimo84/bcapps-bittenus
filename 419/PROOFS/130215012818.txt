Dear Friend,

Thanks for your email, I was happy to receive your mail, I appreciate your
willingness to help me get out of this hell called Syria.

I want to ask you this question.

1. Can you be trusted?

2. Can you handle this business?

3. Can you be able to travel were you will go and claim this money

I want to promise you that this business is 100% risk free, all I need from
you is trust and your promise that my share of the fund will be intact in
your care until i arrived your country for sharing and investment.

You have to help me invest my own share and help me and my family settled
well in your country.

As for the phone call, I don't want you to call me, my calls are been
monitored here, i can only write email as of now.

Can you be able to travel to Dubai or Malaysia as i am working on how to
move the fund out of Syria before 10th of this month through a diplomatic
way.

I will be waiting for your reply before giving you more information.

Regards ,

Eman
