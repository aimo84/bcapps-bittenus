Dear respected
Leonard Zeptowitz=2C

=20

  Thank
you for your mail and many thanks for your interest to assist me transfer my
money to your country for investment. I wished to use this medium to tell
you about myself which I find it very important in a transaction of
this nature. It is true that you don=92t know me but in life coincidence and fate
bring two people together for the purpose of achieving happiness and greatness.
I thank you for your advices and wish for me to have a better future in life=2C
according to your statement and open mind I can see that you are an honest
person and I believe God that our relationship will be profitable.

I am Miss Daniella NESTER born to the family of my parents. My mother
name is Mrs Marina NESTER and my father=92s name is Eng. KOHUT NESTER

I am from  Aboubo =2CSan Pedro Abidjan the capital city of cote
d'ivoire.Resident address lot 104 Rue 12 Benson avenue Abidjan cote d'ivoire
 .I attended Quissvile  primary and nursery school after
graduation=2C I enrolled in ALPHRED  academy one of the best private
college.

=20

My parents
loved me so much and showed great care on me that made me great among my
pears during my tender and school days. I never knew what suffering was as
I have abundance of all life required was really born with golden spoon in my
mouth.

My Mother was a renowned industrialist and exporter of farm produce and
importer of farm imputs.My father died just when I was 5 years. I was
fatherless at a very tender age=3B I can say I had no father because I
never knew who my father was.

My mother tooked care of me and managed my father=92s business which
she made tremendous success in the business. I had all that I needed
and even give to some less priviledeged but life turned down when I
suddenly loss my sweet mother in these present political crises in my
country.=20

It was indeed a (U) turn in my existence and a tragic one when
my wicked uncles denied me access to my mother=92s business and inheritance
property including farm tractor which my mother imported for the
enhancement of our agric farm.

I thank God that I am the only people that have idea of the deposited
money in the bank as I was made the rightful beneficiary. I left our home
when I found out that my uncle want to kill me=2C I left home and ran
to my maternal home where I am currently residing. I enjoy reading and writing
in my spare times.

Actually it=92s not really easy to trust somebody especially a stranger but
because we are human begins we can not do without our fellow humans that is why
we must have to build trust among ourselves.

Please bear in mind that this fund was deposited by my late mother in favour of
me and all the documents related to this transaction are here with me and since
the death of my late mother=2C I have finding things very difficult.

Please I will like you to speed up very fast to make this
project success and I will like to come over to meet you in your
country and start my education where I stop and please kindly accept me
with all your heart because right now=2C I have nobody as trusted
relation here in Africa. It has been my intention and determination to further
my education and live my life in a save country were there is not political
instability and war. These political crises have cost me to lose all that I
have in life. I have lost my both parent and my younger one as a result of this
war in my country.

I have gone to the bank to verify about the fund which they confirmed to me
that the money is still with their bank and they printed the last statement of
the account to proof that they are still in possession of the fund but they
told me that I am not unto 25 years of age that I cannot have access to
the fund that I have to get a guardian who will represent me to receive my
inherited fund on my behalf=2C that is my reasons of contacting you.

I will like to send an Official Notification Letter to the Banker and the
recommended lawyer by the legal department of the bank=2C to inform them about
you as my overseas partner=2C Guardian and representative=2C I will also include
your information in my Notification Letter so that before you contact them they
will have received my letter of notification and you will be known to them
as I will introduce you to them.

notification letter=3B

and Fax Numbers (4) Your Occupation and Your ID card or international

country where we will invest this fund when it comes to your account. And
also  remember that I am still little and does not have enough idea
regarding investment =2C therefore you will take charge /manage any business we
may go into for now while I will be in school  then after=20
