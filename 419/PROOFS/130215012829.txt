Dear: Leonard

Thank you for your respond toward this Partnership between both of us in
this Million Dollars investment Project,this Investment is Real and an (MOU)
agreement is going to signed between us in this Investment as a Bond of Trust
between us.

However i will like to explain to you the workability of this business
proposal to you, the money in question($10M US Dollars) is the money i
made during my tenure as the managing director of (NNPC) because of my
position in governments i cannot be able to fly down to your country
with this fund but i want you to help me transfer this fund to your
nominated bank account, that is to say that the most important thing
is to get this capital into your possession, every documents to back
this up will be secure by my lawyer to make sure the fund will be
transferred in your name as the rightful owner of the fund.

Having said this i need your personal details so that i can be able to
work towards it with my attorney to secure the documents.

1)Full Name...........

3)Sex..................
4)Age...............
5)Phone number................
6)occupation..................

Moreover i want to invest in Real Estate or Hotel Business or any
profitable business you know or you deem fit that we can invest this
fund, because of the economical situation in my country that is why i
decided to invest this money abroad and also the government is already
probing my past administration of my tenure as the former managing
Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) So all i
need from you is your maximum cooperation  so that we can be able to
move this money out of my country to your country, i really need your
assistant because that is the most important thing to do now.
