Hello Friend,

Thank you for your prompt response to my proposal, I appreciate your
interest in this transaction. Your interest to assist me was specific
but, I am still skeptical also in believing that you could be of
assistance to me, however I would like to be sure of your willingness,
trustworthiness and commitment to execute this transaction with me, I
cannot afford to Compromise these virtues.

Considering the money involved, it is necessary for me to be sure of
the person to whom I will be entrusting this transaction; my trust is
not given out lightly. Please, let me have a brief biography of your
person.

What I expect from you is trust and commitment; I want this large sum
of money transferred with your assistance. I want to inform you here
that in pursuing a God fearing partner who can assist me in this
project, I did contact you from my local area chambers of commerce and
industry's directory here in China.

Note that I have not contacted you as a matter of choice but of
necessity knowing fully well the monetary policy of your country and
that of others. This indeed prompted me to informing you of this
matter.

Furthermore, with regards to the legality of this transaction, I must
let you know that this transaction is real and risk free, I want to
know if you are willing to follow up this business seriously before I
can give you more details about this transaction, however I Shall be
waiting your response and assurance.

Sincerely,
Ma Delun
