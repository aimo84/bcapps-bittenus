Dear Beloved ,

Thank you so much for your response to my cry of help to you. You have by
your readiness to assist me given me hope once again after the death of my
parents. Please I will plead that you fully introduce your self to me.

Do not misunderstand me because I only intend to know you very well and
entrust all my estate to your hand. I will like to have your full
information and if possible a copy of your identification. I am helpless
and have nobody to share this with but my heart lead me to you.

Also  I will like to have assurance from you that you will not abandon me
on the way. That you will act like my parents and guide me through my
education as soon as the arrangement of the money is successful.   Please
we must ensure that no third party gets to know about this to avoid any
danger to myself as well as the money. Like I state in my first letter to
you, I am in possession of the lodgment documents of the fund at the
Finance house here in Johannesburg South Africa after the diplomat returned
from usa without making the delivery to my late father's greedy client.

As soon as I receive your assurance to assist me to the end, I will forward
the documents to you and also the contact of the Finance house Johannesburg
where my late father lodged the money as a family valuable without them
knowing the real contents. I believe when you read those documents you will
understand more better, You will notify the Finance house that you are the
foreign partner of my late father and my trusted trustee to assist me claim
the Case Deposit, because i was told they have parents office in
''''Europe, America and Asia'''' and they can move the Deposit there if
needed.

After i saw your message today i spoken with the lawyer that signed the
agreement between my late father and the finance house. He promise to guide
us on the process to get the Deposit done as soon as i introduce you so
that we avoid any form of error or mistake. Please note that I will be
forwarding along with a copy of my identification including my late father
burial pictures so that you will get to know me more and better and i would
not mind if you can do the same too?.

I want to thank you once again for coming to my help and may God bless and
protect your family at all times.  I am waiting for your response and will
write to you as soon as I get it and promise to send you all the legal
documents when I hear from you.

Thank you.
Doreen
