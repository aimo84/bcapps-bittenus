My address is #41, Fortune park-square, 15 chen weng Road, Ngan Chi zhan, Hong Kong. i have lived here for the last 14years; It is not ideal to have your documents send via mailing you can scan and attached or still send via email.

I have really invested much in this transaction so I will please tell you to accept the 30% of the total funds which is $19.7M USD that I have intend to give to you. For your information I will be coming over to your country for my share of the funds, once the funds credits your account at the bank that we will be using for this transaction.

Well if I may remind you again, you are required to send at least a copy of your Driver's License "or" a copy of your International Passport. Besides, it is this copy of your Driver's License or International Passport that will be used by the Attorney to have all the necessary documentations perfected.

The most important issue is that I want to be sure I am transacting with the correct person, I believe these information would be enough to confirm you interest.
Note that because of the nature of my job, we are not allow to send our identification via the internet because of fraudulent people, but i did this in other for you to be sure and have the knowledge of whom you are dealing with.
