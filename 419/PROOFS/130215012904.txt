I work with The Euro Mega Millions Promotions Commission,

"the official monitoring body and the operator  of the Euro

Mega Millions Promotions". I have a mutual business deal for

you, this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner

compel you to honor against your will.

I have a very urgent proposal for you which will be of our

mutual benefit.I wish to seek your acceptance and

cooperation so that the total sum of GBPS 10,000,000.0 can

be paid to you by the Euro Mega Millions Promotions for our

mutual benefit. The said amount is an  unclaimed lottery

prize;the wining prize result was published over four month

ago and since then, the winner of the prize has failed to

come with the winning lottery ticket to claim his or her

winning prize.

You can check the below UK Lottery Post links to see and

understand what I am talking about:

prize-still-unclaimed.asp
http://uk.news.yahoo.com/uk-ticket-scoops-euromillions-

prize-095529368.html

The reasons why some winners fail to claim their prizes may

be one or all of the below:

1. The winner may have accidentally thrown away the tickets

and lost track of the winning ticket number and other vital

information as regards the lucky win.

2. Some winners do not check their tickets properly.

3 The winner may not be aware of the victory .

4. The Euro Mega Millions Promotions does not advice

winners of their winning via email notification that is why

some may not be aware that they won in the draws. Also,

notification of winning via email is fraud attempt because

you cannot win any prize without buying a lottery ticket and

playing the lottery and winners do not pay any fee before

prize is given to them by the Euro Mega Millions Promotions.

5 Due to high rate of internet lottery scam, the winner may

have been discouraged by friends or relatives against

claiming the prize because they think it may be a scam. But

fail to realize that the prize is real as you can see in the

LOTTERY POST NEWS LINK above. Fraudulent lottery informs

you in an unsolicited email that your email address has won

some huge amount of money.

 The simple fact is that, you cannot win a lottery prize when

you did not buy a lottery ticket and partake or play the

lottery as no lottery company is a charity organization that

gives out money on a platter of gold.

All you need to do is to cooperation with me honestly and

confidentially. This project is 100% risk free because it will

be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect

you from any breach of the law as I have mapped out all

plans to ensure we claim this funds without any trace in the

future.

If you are interested provide with below information:

(1) Name (2) Address (3) Country (4) Age (5) Occupation (6) Do you have registered charity organization (7) Have you ever visited UK (8) Phone/Fax. 

Best regards,

Marjan Peong
