Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

I am in receipt of your email and glad you have accepted to partner with me
in this . We never know when life is about to shower us with good fortune,
however we spend so much time wishing that life does, to me it's just like
two friends coming together and share some decent money.
In everything one does with another: there must be a meeting of minds. In
Latin, its called =93consensus adidem=94: Without both of us seeing and
assessing the situation through the same eyeball there cannot and will
never be success or progress.

I need you to obey my every instruction and do exactly as I say. You must
let me direct this project for us to succeed. This is not negotiable. It is
when there is no leadership and no meeting of minds that there are
problems. Everything is going to be done in sequence. I will imagine that
the whole process should take about 2 weeks before the money will be in
your account.

At this time, I have exclusive access to the files of the deposit suspense
account. I will be instructing a solicitor to prepare all the documents in
your name to stand in as the original depositor of the funds, in this case
you would be required to open a business account with our branch. An online
business account will be suitable to complete the process. As soon as your
application for an Online Business Account is granted, the deposit would be
immediately linked with your business account, and the balance inflated to
$ 15,000,000.00 Million Dollars. These funds would be transferred from your
online business account to your personal account in your country, this
would take quiet some process and perseverance to achieve as they say
nothing good comes easy.

It will not be wise and advisable for the money to be cashed in my branch
because it's not possible without implicating us but I am in the position
to link the suspense account to your newly opened business account in my
branch, I understand the important responsibility you are taking for this
deal to be successful as without you, we cannot lay claim to the funds,
hence for your involvement, I am willing we share the money 50% to you, 50%
to me, I don=92t want to be greedy as the money is sufficient for both of us.

The most important thing is for everything to happen smoothly without any
problem, and that we can enjoy our share of this money with absolute peace
of mind. This cannot be over emphasized as we all have names and families
to protect.
At this stage I am sure you have plenty questions you want to ask. We are
going to take this matter on a step-by-step basis. You must understand why
there must be serious confidentiality about this whole process.

As soon as I have made the necessary amendments in the suspense deposit
which the certificate of deposit will be handed over to you, then you
become the legal beneficiary of the total funds, these are totally
verifiable issues because you will be dealing with the bank directly and
not me.
My friend please let us be positive and show discretion as we both make one
of the most fruitful steps of our lives.

Thank you very much and please let me know you have received this email.
Please feel free to get back to me if you have any questions.

Yours Sincerely,
Mr. Jonathan Rojar
