I hope you will provide your valuable times to read the following with sympathetic mind, it was because of the maltreatment that I been receiving from my step mother leads me to this painful conditions, she wanted to kill me and take all my late fathers wealth due to his unexpected death, because I disagreed to change my late fathers bank account to to her name, she suffered me and i am happy to be alive today, do you know that when i wanted to travel out from my country, she noticed and hide my traveling passport, luckily for me, she did not discover where I kept my late fathers file which contains many of his important documents, so I decided to travel out with them, this is why i came here in Senegal through the roads transports from
 my country to this place is very far journey, we spent almost 6days on the road before arriving, though its a distance journey but i had no options than to come here for my safety and to plan for a new life.

I must confess that, it's with great hopes and trusts make me to write this messages which I believes by faiths, it must surely meet you in a healthy conditions. My late father was a business man and also dealing with oil mining equipments before he passed away on that terrible day, meanwhile, I decided to contact you for a personal relationship but now i trust in you because of the urgency of my situation, my late father deposited the sum of (One million eight hundred thousand dolars) in a Bank with my name as the beneficiary, this money was meant for his business and purchase of mining equipments in USA. However, I will scan all the necessary documents and send to you if you accepted to help me invest the money because i will like to complete my studies before doing any business at my age. And I am willing to give you 10% of this money just to show an appreciations, i have decided it and have chosen you to be my Guardian, please accept this offer with
 all your heart and help.

Immediately I received your reply and your interests to help me, I will introduce you to the banker as my Guardian and will give you more details on how to help me. The death of my father actually brought many sorrows to my life. I will like you to help me invest the money because I am ignorant of this business world but i want to ask you these few questions.

1. Can you honestly help me from your heart?
2. Can I completely trust in you?
3. What percentage of the total money will be good for you after the transfer to your bank account?

I am expecting your positive responses so i can introduce you to the banker as my guardian but i will need your details to proceed,only your names, your address and your phone number if you wish to help me so that I will introduce you to the banker. I will tell him you are my guardian and you will represent me for the bank transfer and investment in your country, though, I still needs your strong assurance to make sure we will do this together without any problem,but I am praying and waiting for all your details to proceed without delaying.
With all my love and trust,
Ellema.
