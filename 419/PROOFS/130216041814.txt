Ref: Overdue Payment 10.5 Million
=A0
Attention: Leonard Zeptowitz,
=A0
I have received your mail.

Understand that this is an over due payment approved on your name currently in Central Bank facility waiting for transfer to your bank account.

However, after the Executive Board meeting resolution was made that you will need to open a Non resident account in any of our commercial bank for your overdue fund to be programmed to the Non resident dollar account via onward transfer to your designated bank account.

The Bank Lawyer will get the opening forms on Monday=A0 and I shall forward them to you for you to fill and return for setting up of the account on your name via transfer to your bank account
=A0
Be informed that after the Executive Directors Board Meeting of Central Bank on the 14th February,2013 resolution was reached on your=A0 overdue payment ($10,500,000.00 ) that has been approved on your name=A0 awaiting to be transferred to your bank account. You shall be required to open an account with any of our commercial Banks here for your payment to be programmed to the account and your fund transferred to any of your preferred designated bank account. This payment option of setting up an on-line account here on your name for your fund programming to the account via transfer to your designated bank account is better, cheaper and easier=A0 to monitor the process of your fund transfer into your bank account thereby eliminating third party representation and any form of fraudulent practice on your fund transfer.
Note also that any amount use in opening an account here is still your money as it will reflect to your bank account as opening balance.
=A0
Let us know if you would like setting up an account on your name for your fund transfer, so that the Bank Attorney will pick the opening forms on your behalf and forward them to you to fill and return as quickly as possible as we intend completing this your fund transfer within this first fiscal payment quarter of the year 2013, if you will show sincerity of purpose and remain determined to have your payment.

Waiting for your urgent response for your transaction to be concluded.
