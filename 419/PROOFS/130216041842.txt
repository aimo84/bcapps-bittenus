Dear Leonard=2C

I am Barrister Elia Moffitt. I have a viable business
proposal for you. Please=2C read below the details of this transaction and what
is required for us to get this transaction "started:=20

Ms Angelina Bertoldo's was my client for over a decade.
She died of cardiac arrest in 2006 and she has no next of kin. She had a
deposit in the sum of US$45M with a bank in Europe.

The bank contacted me as Ms. Angelina Bertoldo's attorney
to get her next of kin. I have not been able to get any of her relation. The
bank now has the right to confiscate the funds if I do not produce her next of
kin soonest. This is the reason why I contacted you so I can present you as the
next of kin.

If you provide me with your full name=2C telephone / fax
number and address=2C I will prepare and send to you a memorandum of understanding
which will be duly signed by both parties (your good self and I) so as to
protect the shares of both parties and not in breach of the laws of your
country and the laws of my country=20

After the signing of the MOU=2C then I will email to you
the death certificate of Late Angelina Bertoldo and also the Deposit
certificate of the funds. I will prepare my late client=92s  Will in your name=2C making you the next of kin.
With the Will=2C I will get the letter of administration from the probate
officer. I will forward this Will=2C letter of administration and an application
to the bank requesting for the funds to be transferred to you. The bank will
contact you as soon as the application is approved to come to their office to
sign the funds release documents.

After the signing of the funds release documents=2C they
will then transfer the sum of US $ 45M into your nominated account. I will then
travel to meet with you to share the proceeds. I will take 80% and you will
take 20%.

I will exhort you to not only treat this transaction with
the gravity it deserves=2C but also with urgency. May I reiterate the importance
of the confidentiality and speed in this transaction cannot be over emphasized.
Hence in bolstering of confidentiality you are advised against discussing with
anyone or your bank the expectation of the funds until I advise you otherwise. I
assure you=2C you will never regrets carrying out the transaction with me. Please
feel free to ask questions on areas which appear not to be crystal clear. In
view of the magnitude of the funds=2C proper management of information is the
most necessary ingredient for a 100% realization of this viable transaction. I
must at this juncture extend my assurance that as long=2C as you follow my instruction
promptly and accordingly this transaction will be successful. Please treat as
