Dear Friend,

Thanks for your respond i also welcome your investment  suggestion.
First and foremost it is a good thing that you have responded timely
and I must use this medium to assure you that we must succeed in this
business. I would like to be sure of your willingness, trustworthiness
and commitment to execute this transaction with me, I cannot afford to
compromise these virtues considering the money involved, it is
necessary for me to be sure of
the person to whom I will be entrusting this transaction, and my trust
is not given out lightly.

All we need is trust and commitment; I want this large sum of money
transferred with your assistance. I want to know if you are willing to
follow up this business seriously. I must use this medium to let you
know that this transaction is LEGAL AND RISK FREE ok, I will
ensure that we do everything possible from our end here for you to have
a safe delivery of the funds and gold. I have a very good, trusted and
reliable courier contact used mostly by our forces in Jordan, that can
send goods easily through a private military way, to anywhere in the
world, without them being checked at any port of entry. They can
deliver this money for you easily,
to any address of your choice.

The baggage will be tagged as personal effects and covered with a
diplomatic coverage consignment trunk box, and the courier company will
not know the contents of the boxes. A few friends have used this means
to convey goods, without being checked because of the diplomatic
coverage system. Their charges are very high, but I will negotiate a
way out from this end, till it gets to your door step anywhere and I
will follow up immediately and meet with you for disbursement after you
have received it. I am very sure you will know the best way to handle
this money for us, when it gets to your base. Please do send us your
phone numbers and your address and  I hope the address is where you
want us to deliver the goods through to you. It could be a bank address
or your Company address.

I will start making arrangements as to sending the merchandise to
you.Your Direct Phone number will be use to contact you as soon as
Shipment is in Motion. I will send the total since I can not take any
chances by keeping cash on me. Your percentage stands at 30%.
Meanwhile' I will like to know what you do for a living? Are you
married with kids? Can you handle these funds? I will also want to see
your
passport copy or id/, driver=E2=80=99s License if you have one so I can know
who I am dealing with.

We need to build trust okay? The only people that knew about this are
just me and my partner. You know that the security is very important,
you can not trust anybody therefore, remember to keep it secret. The
total sum amount in the box is $20,000,000 MILLIONS US DOLLARS and I
hope that you can handle it? I hope you are okay with this? Everything
must be done by email until the funds get's to your possession. I hope
you understand me? Once again thanks for your response.

Regards,
Major John M. Dawson
