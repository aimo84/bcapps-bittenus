My Friend,

Greetings to you and your family.

In-fact to tell you the truth,i am so delighted about your message to me
may the good Lord in his infinite mercy enlarge your coast for good this
season Amen. If you can go through my message again you will understand my
plight and why i contacted you,i explained myself and i left with you my
private number for oral conversation +233-548 271 006.

Remember i am only doing this business with you in confidants hoping that
nobody will betray each other at the end of this transaction,let me
reassure you that there is no risk practically involved in this,all i want
you to do is to stand claim as the original depositor of the funds as a
staff of this bank i don't have direct access over the funds that is why i
contacted to assist me.

Like i told you in my first message,this funds is generated in my branch
after the annual account of my branch(2012),as the manager of the branch i
placed it in what we call( ESCROW)call account, in brief escrow call
account is an account without a beneficiary. All i want from you is to
apply to my head office demanding them to close your account and transfer
your funds into your designated bank in your country or your business area
as the case maybe it is a bank to bank transfer.If you agree to work with
me i will send to you an application from my bank demanding my head office
to transfer your funds before you send it to my head office you will send
to me first a copy of the (FILLED)application to enable me store your
information in our data base here in my branch where this fund is generated
as the original beneficiary before you send it to my head office remember
don't mention my name to my head office for them not to raise an eyebrows
on the fund.

I have  the deposit slip the bank will request of you, i told you the
source of the fund and everything about this business should be
confidential. Just call me for more details i will appreciate your
call.when i hear from you i will send to you a text of application for us
to proceed, here in Ghana it will only take three working days(72hrs) to
transfer the funds depending on our seriousness.

After our success i would like you to introduce me  into a lucrative
business in your country as i cannot come back here with such amount
because the authority here will question me on the source of the money,i
promise to offer you 40% of the total fund. Please,don't mention my name to
my head office or to anybody for the sake of my life,job and for them not
to raise eyebrows on the fund,there is no risk practically involved i
promised, i have paid for the transfer charges before contacting you,just
stand claim and apply to my head office,i will provide the deposit slip my
bank will demand of.

I wish you the best as we are about to start a life relationship,Please
