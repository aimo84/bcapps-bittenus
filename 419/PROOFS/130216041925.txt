Dear Lucky winner,

Thanks,for your sincere mail,for us to proceed you are required to write
and send to us a LETTER OF AUTHORISATION signed by
you, stipulating that you have authorized us to be your agent in order to
claim your winning prize.

Be informed that your payment file has been moved to our paying bank
(WITBANK GROUP SA) for immediate payment of your prize-winning money. To
that effect, you are advised to contact the head of International Remittance

Department for the transfer of the fund to your nominated account details
accordingly.

Be advised that the payment of Forex Allocation Bond charges (FABC)/ cost
of Transfer (COT) is payable by the clients that won the lotto prize. That
