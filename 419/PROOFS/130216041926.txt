Hello

I am most grateful for your mail and I seize this opportunity to thank you for coming to my rescue and to also let you know that this transaction is a straight forward and legal transaction. I am somebody with a conscience. If this transaction was in any way illegal, I would tell you straight away so that you know what is involved and decide for yourself. I still think 10%  of $38.5million will be very good for your time and effort so you can have enough funds to reach the less privileged people.
I hope you were not too embarrassed by my first email to you since you do not know me. I had no option since my immediate and extended family in and outside Qatar refused to distribute my funds because they want to keep it to themselves. I didn=E2=80=99t know how to move the funds out and dispatch it to charity organizations, so I resulted to putting fate to test and making a random contact. I got your email address from the web email directory and decided to introduce my plight and this transaction. I am communicating with only you at this moment with regards to this transaction. And I would not have any cause to do otherwise, except you state your intention to withdraw your assistance.
Just like I stated in my first mail to you, this fund is presently in a finance company in Europe. I cannot claim these funds myself as a result of,
=20
(1) I am undergoing medical treatment. It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts

(2) I want God to be merciful to me, I have decided to give financial support  to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth..
 It is for this reasons I am seeking for your assistance to stand as the next of kin to my fund and retrieve it on my behalf and dispatched it to charity organizations after we must have come to a conclusion and reached an agreement. Not before.

 I need you to give me your words that you will be very honest and straight forward with me when the money gets to you, So long as you can execute this transaction successfully and help me dispatched it to charity organizations.

 Thus, I would need you to get back to me on the following issues,

 (1) That you are in a position to be trusted as a God fearing person with such a large amount of fund and dispatched it to charity organization.

 (2) That you ready to sign a letter of guarantee with my lawyer on behalf of me due to my health problem, clearly stating the terms of this transaction, including your percentages and dispatching the remaining funds to charity organizations, as my lawyer will be a living witness that you fulfill your promise of dispatching my funds to charity organizations so that I am assured that the money would be safe in your hands even when I finally pass to decease.

(3) That you fully understand this transaction up to this stage and you are ready to proceed under these terms.
=20
 As soon as I receive your reply that you are ready to proceed under these terms, then I will furnish you with all details for the secure of the release of my fund and dispatch to  charity. But if you have any questions up to this stage, please ask and I will be more than happy to respond to them. Thanks for your mail, your mail has relieved me and I pray to almighty GOD with his infinite mercy to reward you. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it now. I want you to pray for me so that God would forgive me and be merciful to me and accept my soul

 May God bless you .
Regards,
Mrs Zanab Ahmed
