Dear Friend,
                                          
Thanks for
 your response to my email. I really appreciate your willingness to 
assist me in this business and i do assure you that once you could be 
able to deal with me sincerely and honestly that we would have a smooth 
and successful business, This is to give you more information regarding 
to this business, please note that this transaction is 100 percent 
risk/hitch free why because before I contacted you I have perfected 
strategies that will guarantee a smooth and hitch free transaction 
principally because of my position in this bank.
 
Like you saw in
 my proposal letter, this money has been lying in this bank after the 
death of the owner who is a foreigner here in this country Burkina-Faso 
called Mr.Kevin Apollo,by name and unfortunately the customer died with 
his wife and children in the Helios Airways Flight crash in Prague 
Ruzyne International Airport Czech Republic, and since then all efforts 
to get across to his relatives proved abortive and since then this money
 has been in a dormant account in this Bank, So the bank governing 
bodies how now planning to convert his account into government treasury 
and which I do not want this to happen, That is why I wrote you, 
suggesting to you to apply as the next of kin to the deceased.
 
Because
 of my position in this bank as bill and exchange Manager in this bank, I
 have decided to use my position to present any reliable and competent 
foreigner as the next of kin to the deceased whom should be paid this 
money as true inheritor. Therefore, I will prepare an application of 
claim on which I will forward to you for you to fill and send it to the 
management of this bank as result of the application, I believe that 
after verifications, they will then approve this money in your name.
 
Once
 this approval for payment is granted to you this money will be 
transferred into any of your nominated bank account and as soon as this 
is done I will then come down to your country to see the investment 
climate there. Once this transaction is over, all documents relating to 
the account of the deceased customer will be destroyed and the records 
in our computer system will be deleted to ensure that in the next one 
million years nobody will ever have any reason to remember this account 
again.
 
What you should do now is to send to me through this mail box:

1, Your name in full.
2, Address (House and office),
3, Your Direct mobile Telephone,
4, Yours Age,
5, Yours Marital Status,
6, Yours Occupation.
7, Yours Country.
8, Your Bank Account Details.
9, Your Passport Copy or I.D card.
10, Your E-mail Address.
 
Upon
 the receipt of the above mentioned data, this transaction will commence
 immediately and I assure you that this transaction will not last more 
than ten working days. You should also feel free to call me on my phone 
number +226-79 33 10 65 for us to discuss orally meanwhile as soon as 
you receive this mail just send all the needed information so that we 
will commence this transaction immediately.
 
Best Regards,
Mr.Michel Kabore.
