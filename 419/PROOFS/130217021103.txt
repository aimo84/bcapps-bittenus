Dear,
=C2=A0
However, every necessary arrangement has been made to transfer this fund directly into your account which you will provide.
=C2=A0
Please=0A I appreciate your mail which you sent to me for more assurance and =0Atrust=C2=A0=C2=A0 This is because this fund had been my hope of retirement after =0Amany years in service and I don=E2=80=99t want to loose it or one to betray me.
=C2=A0
As=0A soon as I hear favourably from you, I shall send to you an application =0Aform which you will fill correctly with your banking informations where =0Athis fund will lodge and forward to our bank for the release of the =0Afund. with my id card.
=C2=A0
I=0A guarantee you 100% risk free of this claim since the deceased died a =0Along time with all his immediate family leaving no one for the claim.
=C2=A0
There=0A is no doubt about your eligibility as the legal next of kin or partner =0Ato our deceased customer and owner of the account number NO.BOA4934109 =0Awith the following=0A reasons;
(1.)Before the death of our deceased customer, his true next of kin was not
indicated to the board of directors of the bank because of the top secrecy
and confidentiality of the business which our late customer transacted with
the various governments in West Africa .
=C2=A0
(2.)Owning to his failure to indicate his next of kin to the officials of
the bank, it is therefore impossible for the board of directors of the bank
to verify the next of kin .
=C2=A0
(3.)=0A The deceased late MR. KATTAN SALIF did not have any relationships with =0Aour bank; he was only a customer to our bank. So there is no trace =0Aeither now or in future.
=C2=A0
(4.) And for the above reasons, the managements of the bank authorised me
officially as the auditor manager of the bank to verify the next of kin to
our deceased customer. Therefore, the bank will always abide by my official
directions through the=0A official authorisation bestowed on me.
And for this reasons you have nothing to fear as your interest and identity
will be legally protected. This is our life time opportunity.
=C2=A0
You have to stand as the beneficiary to this fund and also provide an account where the fund will be transferred into.
=C2=A0
Please=0A don't be afraid, as an insider in the bank, I guarantee you that all =0Aarrangement for the smooth claim of this money has been finalized before=0A contacting you.
=C2=A0
I give you my words, we are going to conclude this transaction in Good Faith and share the fund peacefully.
What=0A you have to do is to listen to my instructions to avoid any mistake =0Auntil the fund is transferred into your account then I will come over to=0A your country for the disbursement of the fund according to the =0Apercentages indicated.
=C2=A0
When this fund is transferred there will be letter my bank will issue to your bank to show the fund is legally acquired.
=C2=A0
This business will take us about 7 banks working days. I assure you that we will all smile at=0A the end of the day.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0Your=0A own share of the fund will be 30 percent; I will take 60percent while =0A10 percent shall be used for any expenditure that might encure during =0Athe transfer.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =C2=A0
Please as soon as you receive this mail you make sure you call me for urgent instruction.
=C2=A0
Again I am assuring you that this is risk free ok
=C2=A0
Once=0A again I want you to make=0A this transaction your top secret as you know I am still a staff of the =0Abank and I wouldn't like anything that will=C2=A0=C2=A0 jeopardize my job =0Asecurity.get back to me to enable me send to you a text of application =0Aform which you will fill and send to the bank.
