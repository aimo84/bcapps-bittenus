Greetings and thanks for your response to my email. As a banker=2C I am aware of the various atrocities and scams propagated over the Internet but please this is not of such. I am only contacting you in desperation out of the reality of the circumstances and dilemma that I find myself.
I was the personal account officer and also=2C acquaintance to a certain customer of this bank (HSBC=2C MALTA) who was an independent oil contractor here in the MALTA but died in the tsunami of 26th December 2004 in Indonesia. He and his entire family were killed in that disaster that shook the world. He operated a domiciliary investment account with the private banking division of HSBC and that account was one of numerous accounts assigned to me. The balance in the account was $6.8 million USD when he died but accrued interest over the past years to a little over 7.2 million USD in the last quarter of 2008. Before I continue=2C let me sensitize you with one law in the MALTA banking act. It stipulates that any such funds owned by a deceased customer in the banking system must be brought to the notice of the government and subsequently taken over by the government if at the expiration of 4 years no valid beneficiary or next of kin applies for claim of such funds. The next of kin to the account was his eldest daughter as his wife died of cancer several years ago and he didn=92t re-marry. The most tragic part of it all is that he died along with his entire family (i.e. that same daughter listed as his next of kin and two sons).
As the relationship officer to the deceased customer=2C my bank appointed me to oversee that a relative of his that can qualify as next of kin is appointed so that they can take over the funds as inheritance. So=2C since the death of the deceased customer=2C I have written several letters to your country's embassy with the intent to trace and locate any of his extended relatives to whom shall be bestowed upon as claimants/beneficiaries of his abandoned personal funds in the custody of my bank=2C but all such efforts have been to no avail. So this was the situation with the deceased customer who coincidentally happens to share similar details with you. This is why I am reaching out to you so desperately.
Because the funds was to be taken over by the government as prescribed in the banking act due to our inability to get a next of kin for the deceased account by the government. I had to initiate a transfer of the entire funds in the account and retired it before it becomes too late. This became necessary as the fund in the deceased account was almost due for scheduling as unclaimed inheritance to the coffers of the MALTA government as funds from an unclaimed estate.So I had to make a closure on the deceased account and subsequently transferred the entire sum therein to a number account in the  RESERVE BANK OF INDIA (RBI)  because the foreclosure and eventual remittance of the funds to the MALTA government was then due in a matter of weeks. If I hadn=92t done that=2Cthe funds would have become the governments. I couldn=92t just sit and watch as all they would have used the money for is to fund unnecessary wars and their unnecessarily large cabinets. I want to saved the situation with this action of transferring the fund out of my banks system to the number account (It=92s a secret account that uses only numbers and not names) in RESERVE BANK OF INDIA. that has been setup for this reason. It=92s a very common type of account in Swiss banking. I did all these because there was still no valid beneficiary or next of kin to the funds.
Now another problem has arisen although I expected it. RESERVE BANK OF INDIA (RBI) sent me a notice yesterday that a beneficiary hasn=92t yet applied for the transfer of 7.2 million USD in their custody. They wrote that they are obligated to reverse the transfer if no beneficiary applies for the funds within the next 21 days. I can=92t afford to let this happen as the funds will come back to my bank and be declared as profit at the end of the year.
This now brings us to what I desperately need you for as you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I now propose. I NEED YOU TO APPLY FOR THE FUNDS with RESERVE BANK OF INDIA! I will arrange all the paperwork including probate and give you all the information you will need including the transfer control keys which proves to RESERVE BANK OF INDIA that you are indeed the beneficiary to the transfer. I assure you that we can have the entire 7.2 million USD to your name within the next 48 banking hours if you=92ll grant your consent to this project and follow my instructions to the letter. There is entirely no risk to you or me in this project as it=92s already a concluded matter at my bank. All that=92s remaining for me to do is write a report that I was able to get a valid next of kin (which shall be you) for the funds and backing it up with a letter of probate from the Royal Court of Justice MALTA.
Upon the receipt of your reply=2C I will send you by E-mail the next step to take to facilitate this transaction in the shortest possible time. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this proposal shall be entirely hitch-free and legally conducted. You should not entertain any fears as the required arrangements have been planned by me for the completion of this project. If you choose to do this with me=2C I propose that 50% (subject to review by you as you shall legally be in control of his estate) of the proceed of this project shall go into a foundation in the name of the deceased customer to be overseen by me and you and=2C then the remaining 50% shall be shared between us in equal ratios as commission for our work. Please bear in mind that if you don=92t do this project with me=2C the funds will be returned to my bank and there will never be any mention of the name of the deceased customer and that of his family.
You should not entertain any fears as the required arrangements have been planned by me for the completion of this project. So=2C what I need from you now in your reply email are:
(1).Your exact full names (First Name=2C Middle Name and Last name)
(2).Your current residential address
(3). Your Occupation
(4). Your Age.
I need to harmonize them with my records. PLEASE SEND THEM IMMEDIATELY YOU GET THIS EMAIL.
I am aware of the consequences of this proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive. If my offer is of no appeal to you=2C delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal.
You may not know this but people like me in this kind of situation have made tidy sums out of comparable situations like this and they run the whole private banking sector. I am not a criminal and what I do=2C I do not find against good conscience=2C this may be hard for you to understand=2C but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by=2C for once I find myself in total control of my destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy my chance=2C if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this situation=2C good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing. If you find yourself able to work with me=2C contact me through this same email account. If you give me positive signals=2C I will initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you that should you contact me via official channels=3B I will deny knowing you and about this project. I repeat=2C I do not want you contacting me through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only through the numbers I will provide for you and also through this email address. I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management Policy.
Please observe this instruction religiously. Please=2C again=2C note I am a family man=3B I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences=2C but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learnt from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord=2C we should plan a meeting soon.
So all I require from you is your consent and solemn confidentiality on this from you as it shall remain our secret forever. Deals like this takes place every day in the banking world and the reason you never hear about them is because they never fail. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios. This is a one in a lifetime chance for both me and you. Please don't fail me.
Yours Sincerely.
