I know that your the reliable person who could help me achieve my goal of getting these funds out of the bank before its forfeited to the government,I am putting in all my attention to this transaction that I brought to you hoping that it will be concluded within 10 working days from the day that we apply for the remittance of the funds into your designated account as the beneficiary with the writ of mandamus which I will provide you as the next in kin to our dead client. Now I need the A/C information and your private tel/fax nos as a need may arise either to call you in the day or night as occasion warrants.
