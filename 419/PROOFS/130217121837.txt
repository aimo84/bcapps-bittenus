number bellow, trust and confidential till the funds will disbursed to 
any trusted account provided by you and guarantee of my own share is my 
most concern, I dedicated myself to reply you these email because of the
 need for absolute secrecy in this transaction. And naturally since I

personally because of its peculiarity I believe we can work together to 
achieve great success for onward remittance of the said funds, I want to
 begin by assuring you that we can consummate this transaction within 15
 working days from the date of commencement. As the procedures relating

serve to introduce you to the bank, and of course trigger the processing
 of your transfer request. The bank will then carry out some 
verification procedures; example, they will demand for the deposit and 
death certificate of the deceased from you which is the procedure of 
long time deposit of investors according to Dubai financial rules and 
regulations, i already have the scan documents in my safe possession  
which will make every procedure smooth for us,
