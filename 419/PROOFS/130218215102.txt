Compliment!!!

I received your reply and I appreciate the fact that you need more details
about my investment project proposal i sent to you. I really need to take
my time to explain my business proposal and investment plans to you. Based
on my circumstance with the UK government, there is need for me to place
you officially as sole original beneficiary of my funds because I=92m
handicap due to the present heat and surveillance on me by the British
government. But be rest assured there is a well proper way this could be
handle thus must be kept highly confidential within us.

I absolutely agree that you are confident that deserve more detailed
information in such a way as to fully understand what it entails the
transfer and co-operation as necessary, because it has nothing to do with
any risks or problems, but for security reasons and other arrangements with
this operation, The transaction will have no impact on your integrity and
reputation of each plan to protect your images, and security has been
created put in place prior my contacting you. I have engaged the services
of a well renowned financial attorney here who will handle all relating to
this project securely, to avoid any interruptions.

Because of my curiosity the funds must get to your country first, before
anything. NB: this transaction is 100% legitimate, and you must be
committed not just to facilitate it but must give it the time and attention
it requires for our favour, Most importantly you must be calling regularly
on my private phone no (07) 024038733  so as to monitor issues and
cooperate accordingly once these agreements are fully implemented, after
the transfer you are obliged to meet my lawyer in your country in few days
to celebrate and discuss investment plans including final endorsement for
successful completion of this project profitable. In addition, all of this
activity is 100% risk free, and you are not exposing yourself to any danger
or damage even
now and after the project is completed and established.

There might still be need for your presence briefly perhaps as the case
maybe as procedure to be adopted will be official and legal. Consequently,
Before we proceed I need answers to the following below as follows:

How many people have you told about this?
Can you provide an enabling account for the receipt of the investment funds?
Can you be able to travel from your country, in the course of this project,
if required?
Can you explain a little about yourself?
Can you give me the time, this investments Demands?
What guarantee do I have that my investment funds will actually be safe
with you, and all will be done as agreed once the fund hits your account?

Explain more to me about your company if you have any, also your country
Economy, all these are necessary to me before we can proceed on this
project. The amount in question that i actually want to move on your care
for investment is (US$79 Million United State Dollars). Remember that
confidentiality should be our watch word, so you are expected not to
disclose it to anyone yet, even close as your family for now, because of my
name I hope you understand that?

I think it will be proper I let you know more about me and know who you are
dealing with. If you are conversant with international news you would have
known me by now. Well I am the son of the Late UK most famous publisher
Robert Maxwell who died in 1991. The collapse of my late father Robert
Maxwell's Mirror Group media empire become the biggest personal bankrupt in
UK history with debts of =A3406.5 million in 1992.

The bankruptcy was lifted three years later and I was a director of Media
Company called Telemonde, which has since failed. I married Pandora in 1984
and I once lived in a manor house in 10 acres (40,000 m2) of land in
Oxfordshire. We have seven children but separated in 2007. I have since
then entered into a further arrangement over debts I accrued subsequently,
which is close to ending.

After I was discharge from bankruptcy in 2005, I went into property
industry where I found the knowledge of been involved in setting up large
property deals, including the sale of Earls Court Exhibition Center and
Olympia and the purchase of Stables Market in Camden Town. Although my
father was accused of diverting some funds belong to the UK government
which never happened, because he was having his investments in place that
will never allow him do what he was accused of. Because of the issues on
ground, the UK government has since then confiscating most of his funds and
his investment he left on ground. The remaining ones they knew not about
that I have been managing since 2005.  All assets and liquid cash are now
on my name, but I can no longer do anything on my own right now, because of
the sickness that attacks me and ongoing court case i have with UK
Government and other issues on ground.

I would have come to your country to discuss this with you one on one, but
right now as you already know the circumstances surrounding me now will not
allow me to come over because of the embargo they have place on me not to
travel out of the country, because I still have court case with UK
government that still on ground. This was why I contacted you to assist me
receive the investment funds and be sincere honest to move them for
investment in your country and invest them promptly on an investment that
will bring good annual returns for both of us.

You can see that I do not represent any company but my late father=92s wealth
that I am carefully handle and managing. If you want a web page on the
facts as stipulated, you can log on to:

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1495471/Maxwell-sells-to-keep-bailiffs-at-bay.html

Please I want you to keep all this information's I am passing to you as
secret confidential between me and you to enable the successful moving of
the investment funds to your country for investment. Please do not mind the
mode of my communications with you for now  because I think this the only
way I can get your attention to build confident between both of us. One
thing you must be aware of is the confidentiality involved in any
information passed to you.

ready in respect of this projects.
