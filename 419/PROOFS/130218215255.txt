Dear Friend  Leonard Zeptowitz=2C

Thank you for your nice mail. Please=2C take your time to read this mail and get back to me ASAP. This=20
is the more clarification of what we have to follow in the process of=20
the transaction. I=20
have found it necessary to give you full explanation on this Business=20
deal and breakdown of the modality which we have to follow to achieve=20
success. I am a banker and an insider=3B I know the process to be taken=20
officially in the bank to investigate and verify your claim to grant you
 approval as the next of kin to the late customer. I know and I am=20
optimistic that this business deal will uplift our financial status=2C=20
it=92s just for you to follow my instruction and guidelines until the fund
 will enter your Bank Account .I need your absolute co-operation in this
 great opportunity. Actually=2C we need to build a memorandum of=20
understanding and trust between each other in this transaction. Please=2C=20
trust me and have confidence in this transaction.
=20
This business=20
is a great deal and will need determination and great arrangement to=20
succeed. The arrangement which has already been made is my underground=20
responsibility in the bank in seeing that the whole process to be taken=20
to achieve your approval and for the smooth transfer of the fund to your
 desired Bank Account is made without any conceivable hitch. I assure=20
you that all loopholes and security measures are covered and all=20
obstacles removed. This business deal will never endanger any of us on=20
both sides now or in future.  It is 100% free from any risk whatsoever.=20
Nobody know about this account but me alone as his account manager and=20
he warned me not to let any of his family know it. So=2C I kept it as=20
secret.  All you have to do=2C is just to keep this transaction as top=20
secret for the security of the business. Don't disclose it to anybody=20
until the fund is transfer to your bank account. To remind you=2C this=20
transaction is not a child's play nor a little amount involved. We are=20
talking of over 5million U.S Dollar and so=2C I will not like anybody (not
 even you) to spoil it for me because it had taken me years to arrive at
 the stage before I decided to look for a foreigner to assist me. As you
 assist me to claim this fund=2C We have a lot to gain and many more=20
greater Business to handle together immediately we successfully=20
completed this transaction.
=20
It is important you know that here=20
in BENIN REPUBLIC=2C as a fast developing country=2C many good financial=20
opportunities involving millions and billions of Dollars do exist but=20
our major problem here has been that of finding reliable and trusted=20
foreign partners to collaborate with us especially=2C someone that can=20
keep secret.  If you really prove yourself worthy=2C you will ever be=20
grateful and happy throughout your life time for knowing me as your=20
business partner. To be very honest with you=2C this transaction I have=20
opened-up to you is totally genuine and 100% risk-free. I am absolutely=20
assuring you that no problem is involved in this transaction. You should
 know that=2C the next of kin to the deceased can be a Brother=2C Sister=2C=20
Mother=2C Uncle=2C Cousin=2C Nephew=2C Wife=2C Son=2C Daughter=2C Business partner or=20
even far relations from any Continent. The Bank is not interested to=20
know if you are bearing the same surname with the deceased customer or=20
not. The bank is only interested to know the correct information about=20
the deceased and his account details which I am giving to you now. So=2C=20
you are free to apply for the release of the fund to your account as his
 next of kin.
=20
TRUST AND CONFIDENCE.
I need to emphasis on the
 need for trust and confidence on both side as the pillar for the=20
success of this business. You need to reassure me that you will not=20
betray me and sit on this fund when it finally comes into your custody.=20
Although I prayed and fasted before I decided to contact you as my=20
foreigner partner to stand as his next of kin.So=2C your share will be 40%
 while 60% will be for me. As a financial adviser to the deceased=2C I=20
don't want IDB Bank to transfer this fund to the Government treasury as=20
unclaimed bill. It is better for us to claim the fund and build a=20
charity home for the poor and needy and God will be happy with us=20
instead of the fund to be share among the Government politicians that=20
can not use the fund wisely.  According to our banking law and=20
procedure=2C the bank cannot release the fund to anybody unless someone=20
related to the deceased customer applies as his next of kin and if the=20
fund remain unclaimed for five (5) years then=2C the fund will be transfer
 into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The only way to proceed=20
further is that=2C you should send your banking details to the bank e-mail
 address as to enable the bank to transfer the fund to you as his next=20
of kin.
=20
This Business deal will be covered with legal approval=20
from the bank. You will be approved officially by the bank as the=20
authentic relation (cousin or Business Partner) of the late customer=20
through official bank process in your name as to avoid question about=20
the origin of the fund from any Government. The bank will approve the=20
fund to you after going through your Data submitted and confirm that you
 are the real next of kin.  Thereafter=2C IDB Bank will give you Transfer=20
