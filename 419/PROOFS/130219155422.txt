My Dear;Leonard Zeptowitz,

Good Day,

In furtherance to our mail conversation indicating your positive response
towards assisting me in this  mutual beneficial transaction I hereby convey
the approval  to open discussion with you .

For purpose of clarity where i work as one of  member of the Contract
Review and Award Committee (C.R.A.C) here in the Department of minerals and
energy where I work as the Director of Audit and project implementation. I
have  vested with the authority to appraise and approve contracts according
to the priority of the government of South Africa, and by virtue of my
official position, i have been able over a period of time through careful
review of contracts awarded secured for my self this over invoice amount of
US$35,000, 000,.00, which was originally awarded to a foreign company. The
contract had since been commissioned, the contractual sum and all
entitlements has since been paid to the original contractor. The US$35,000,
000,.00 is the balance, which I  intend to transfer to the nominated
account you will provide for us.

There are however some procedures for the successful conclusion of this
project. With the information=92s you will provide, i will register your name
or your company's name as a foreign contractor with my ministry, and i will
also incorporate your name or company with the corporate affairs commission
of South Africa.

After i have been able to do this successfully, i will also proceed to the
ministry of justice for the transfer of rights and privilege. The
contractual documents will be backdated to suit the purpose of this
transaction. And the ministry of finance will then approve the amount
US$35,000, 000,.00  for payment to the beneficiary, and you will be
contacted by South African Reserve Bank Through the contract review and
payment committee, an arm set up by the Reserve Bank of South Africa to
make payments to foreign contractor, From this stage onward all
correspondence will be channeled to you, you will now advice them on how
this funds will be transferred to your nominated account, and as soon as
you confirm to me that these funds have been successfully transferred to
your account i shall take the next available flight to meet with you in
your country for the final disbursement, and you will advice me on a viable
business opportunities in your country,because i don't intend bringing this
funds back to south Africa.

 I am  going to be doing all these with the connivance of the principal
trustee of the original contractor. If you follow my instructions
religiously, we will conclude this transaction within the next Ten to
Twelve (10-12) working days.

All machinery have been put in place for the successful conclusion of this
project and i  have equally budgeted some amount of money for all the
documentations to be gotten from the government parastatas and ministries
to be involved, this funds was gotten as a short term loans and mortgage
which i intend to pay back after we have completed this transfer.
