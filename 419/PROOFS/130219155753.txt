Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thanks for your response, like I told you on my first mail. You have to
assure me of my percentage because as soon as I finish with the
arrangement, I will be flying to your local  airport with the Boxes to
avoid any stress on transit till I get to you for delivery and sharing of
the funds, i am  agreed with you that 15% will be going to charity

You can call me on this phone 404-826-1746 Please all our communication on
phone should be brief because I don't want any of my colleagues to suspect
me as you know that I am still in active service..

Though, I know that we don't supposed to do this as we supposed to declare
the content of the boxes and return the money to UN Office but due to my
financial situation now I have no other option than to do it to save my
future and the future of my family.

You have to act fast in sending the requested information=92s your phone
number# , name and address in full and the name of the nearest Airport to
me also a full Guarantee of my Share to me because I will finalize every
arrangement before 2 hours today and I will board a flight and proceed to
meet you with the boxes.

Please, I don't want to deal with any other person or party on this
transaction because I have to protect my legitimate service with United
Nation. As soon as I conclude all arrangement today, I will send my flight
schedule and a copy of my ID to you for facial identification upon my
arrival at your local airport

Waiting to hear from you.

Jack Bryant
INSPECTION OFFICER
