Dear Zeptowitz,

Thanks for your kind reply in respect of my business proposal. As regards to this transaction, I stand to assure you that there is no problem in this transaction for it is 100% legal, and you only have to comply to my instructions so that you will not make any mistake when we start this transaction.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

My personal data is as follows:=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

1. NAME: Alhaji Issa Youssef=20
2.. AGE: 57 Years
3. MARITAL STATUS: Married with three children
4. OCCUPATION: Banker (Bank of Africa)
5. YEARS OF EXPERIENCE: 15 Years
6 STATE OF ORIGIN: Bobo Dioulaso
7. COUNTRY: Burkina Faso

=C2=A0
BACKGROUND OF TRANSACTION;=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

The Name of the deceased Customer was Mr. Park Jun-Yung, a foreigner from Seoul Korea. He nationalized here for years before he died in 2004. He was a contractor and the major supplier of agricultural equipments in West Africa. He had an account with our bank and I was his account officer for many years before his death.=20

=C2=A0

Five years after his death, I spent time, made all the necessary enquires to find out if I can get anyone related to him, to come forward and claim his fund left behind in our branch, but all my efforts proved abortive. This search lasted for over 3 years but all to no avail. It was during this search that I found out that the person that he used as his Next of Kin died along with him in the accident as they were traveling for a holiday, leaving no one to claim his fund left in our branch for 9 years now. The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than 9 years, because the bank will send it to the bank's treasury as an abandoned or unclaimed fund.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

Truly, it was after this discovery and unsuccessful search to get any of his relation that I decided to contact you so that I can use your name for the claim of this fund. Consequence upon the fact that I do not want the fund to be transferred into our bank=E2=80=99s treasury as an abandoned or unclaimed fund, I got this opportunity and decided to contact you for the mutual benefit of our both families.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

More so, I wish to point out that I want 10% of this money be shared among the charity Organizations in your Country, while the remaining 90% will be shared equally between you and me. As I stated above, this transaction is risk free, legal and has no negative implication. I have perfected everything to guarantee success, you should not be afraid of anything.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

Nevertheless, you must try to keep it secret in order not to tarnish my image as a senior staff of this bank. Most Importantly, I will like you to assure me that you will not betray this trust and confidence that am about to repose on you.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

I have worked very hard in my life and I have always maintained high level of discipline and integrity. This is an opportunity which I must strive relentlessly to accomplish. Besides, in a no distant time, I will be leaving for retirement. So during the transfer process into your bank account, there will be little upfront expenses because the fund which is to transfer into your account in your country has been dormant in our Bank for years, and before the bank will transfer the fund to your account or ATM card, the Bank will advise you to make the dormant account to start functioning well again so that they will make the transfer smoothly into your bank account.=C2=A0=20

=C2=A0

Finally, if you wish to achieve this goal with me, kindly get back to me with the following to assure me of your capability of handling this transaction and to enable me open a file with your name here in my office as the true next of kin to our Deceased customer, and after opening the file with your name, I will send you an application form which you will fill and send to our Bank Foreign Remittance Department for this transfer.=20
