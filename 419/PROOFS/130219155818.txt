Hello Leonard,

I am 15 years old, and I am looking for a honest person to help me with
investing the money my parent's left me when they died, the money have been
in a trust for over a year now, the insurance company where my parents
obtained life insurance policy on, paid the money into the trust for me a
year ago, I am told by the trust account manager, that I must present a
third party trustee of over 30 years old, who will receive the money on my
behalf for investment, since the trust clearly states that money should not
be released directly to me to avoid mis-management, unless I am over 30,
but only to a trustee presented by me to be used towards viable investment,
to guarantee my financial security, I really need your help, my father's
trust account manager is stealing from the trust, he makes me sign
documents every time that enables him take out $500,000.00 he says's it's
tax purpose. I would like to nominate you as a third party trustee, if you
can invest $18.3M properly, I will be willing to leave you in charge of all
the investment decisions, I just want an investment that will cater for my
need, before the account manager takes all the money away. I will give you
100% control of the fund, and the investment, I want money coming to me
monthly from the investment though, I will give you 15% of the $18.3M to be
act as my Trustee, so the Trust can be released to you and you can invest
the rest of the 85%.

YOUR'S SINCERELY
Albert
