Dear Friend,

I received your mail am very glad for your =0Awillingness to assist me and yourself, regard to your mail.I want you to=0A follow the instruction of my mail by giving me the below required =0Ainformation's to enable me to send you the text of application which you=0A will use to apply to the bank, if you don't have an account then you =0Ahave to do your best possible to open an account or you should use your =0Afriend or relation account whom you trust.

Mr.Saidur Rahman An =0Aaccountant by profession, I'm 46yrs old, presently working at the office=0A of auditing and accounting department Central Bank Of Africa (CBOA).I'm=0A married with two children. My residence address no:18 avenue de la =0Acharles Degaulle sect: 21.Box Postal: 01 BP 5256 Ouagadougou Burkina =0AFaso

As the auditing and accounting manager of this bank, I have =0Astudied this transaction very carefully and i have noted that there is =0Ano risk involved. I am here to protect all your interests in this =0Atransaction until this money hits your account. My advise to you is to =0Aarrange for a bank account into which our bank shall transfer this money=0A in your favours as next of kin and you have nothing to fear since I am =0Ahere, I shall be giving you all the developmental information from the =0Abank as soon as the transaction commence.

DR.RAYMOND BECK, A =0ACITIZEN OF ATLANTA, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA who nationalised here in =0ABurkina Faso for (16) years. He died in (Egypt air ways that crashed at =0AAbidjan with his family. Since his death, nobody has applied to our bank=0A for the release of this money to him or her as the next of kin, for =0Athis reasons you have nothing to fear as your interest will be =0Aprotected. Also note that 7 working days from the date the bank receives=0A your application is enough for the funds to get transferred into your =0Abank account successful conclusion.

Dear, I hope that you will =0Anot disappoint me when this money enters into your account, I have all =0Amy hope in this transaction because I shall soon resign my appointment, i=0A am a simple banker whose credibility is still intact and with my =0Amaturity and understanding, If you are really interested in this =0Atransaction, then we must hurry up so that our bank and government shall=0A not claim and inherit this money because it has over-stayed. But before=0A that I will like to be reassured of the manner of person whom I am =0Adealing with because (10.5million US Dollars ) is not a little money, =0Atherefore I have to get certain necessary facts about you before we =0Aproceed. Such information I will like to know before we proceed are as =0Afollows:
(1) Your age
(2) your full name
(3)Your occupation
(4)Your marital status
(5)Your full residential address
(6)Your phone number
(7)A=0A copy of Your photo scanned and sent to me by mail. As soon as I receive=0A these data's, I will forward to you the text of application which you =0Awill fill and send to the bank for the claim.

I have decided to =0Ado this deal because I have worked in this bank for years without =0Aachieving anything due to the corruption in this country. Workers =0Asalaries are hardly paid. Its true this country is one of the poorest in=0A the world but the leaders are very wicked and corrupt. Even the Aids we=0A receive a times from Donor countries as well as the international =0Acommunities are being diverted into the private pockets of those in =0Aauthority.

Therefore while the rich are getting richer, the poor =0Amasses continue to suffer. Could you believe a manager like myself can't=0A even take good care of my children? I only have a name NOT money or any=0A material possessions. So this is why when I saw this opportunity, I =0Adecided to capitalize on it with my position in the bank and i hope with=0A your co-operation success will be for us.

Pls always keep in =0Atouch with me regularly to facilitate a very smooth transaction. Finally=0A it's very mandatory that you will follow all my instructions to avoid =0Aany mistake in this transaction, you should not in anyway let the bank =0Aknow about my involvement in this transaction, Here is my direct line: =0A(+226 6830 1019) for further clarification.

I'm waiting to hear from you
Thanks
Saidur rahman
