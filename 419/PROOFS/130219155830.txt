Hello Dear  ,

Firstly I have to say a big thanks to you and I am thanking you also for
your prompt reply to help me, one thing I am assuring you is that you will
never in any way regret coming in contact with me. I will like to meet you
in person very soon and I really want you to help me to transfer this funds
to your bank account and after which you will also help me so that I can
come out from this refugee camp and come over to your country and be with
you. I will like to invest in your country if you will be there for me
Please do all your possible best to assist me out OK.I promise to offer you
15% of the total money for helping me and the remaining money will be
managed by you in any business of your choice.I have mapped out 15% for
your assistance and 5% for any expenses that might come up in this transfer.

I am the first daughter in the family of 2 girls.I am Medical student,yet
to complete my University program and I was only doing my second year when
the unexpected happened and I lost my parents,Well, my life history is a
mixture of sorrows and happiness to those who have human sympathies .

My late father was very wealthy and as a result of this,his blood relatives
planned and killed him during the  crisis in my country . I will tell you
more about him when we have the opportunity to live and stay together, it
really pains me a lot to recollect or remember the memories of his death as
he was killed rudelessly .

Meanwhile, my mother and my father were killed at the same day with my
younger sisters while they were taking there night meals in our house .
They were butchered to death . In fact,I narrowly escaped the ordeals
because of God ,I still in school hoping to come back for the weekend-break
before the incidence occurred on Friday night . When I heard the news, it
was like the whole world has collapsed on my shoulder,in fact, I couldn't
believe it at first but, as we know that in every rumors, there is an atom
of truth .

When the war kept persisting and people started dying on the street anyhow
and there was record of series of rapes by the so called security agencies,
we were advised by my school authority to leave the boarding house for our
lives. At this point, the school authority arranged the Catholic
Missionaries Agents to ship us Social Global Parish Welfare Church
Camp,Banfora Burkina Faso.I would have loved to come to meet you but to be
very honest with you, I do not have the financial means to sponsor myself
at the moment . if possible you can sponsor me to come over to your country
first before the bank transfer the fund I will also like it so that we can
see in person.

My current refugee status according to the bank manager in London will not
accord me the privilege to transfer the money in my name,that is reason I
contacted you for help me to receive the money into your account there . If
you want to contact me on phone use this office line +226 68 34 54 05
remember to tell rev father Peter Andrew that you want to speak with Anita
Ahmed from Sudan.Do send me your full information, so that I will use it to
write letter to the African Development Bank Burkina Faso and inform them
about you as my foreign partner and for them to know you are from me when
you contact them and I will send you the bank contact information in
Burkina Faso once I receive your full details.

This camp is HELL and no ideal person wishes to stay and live here.I do not
have a computer. but the computer in the library of the church had provided
a great opportunity for me and others to be able to interact with the
outside world, despite the limited time given .I do not care about age
because love has no limit.Provided that you can find a place in your heart
for me I will be very happy.

Fill the information's below and get back to me.
