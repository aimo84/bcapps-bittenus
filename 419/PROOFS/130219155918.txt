Dear
Partner, 

I thank you very much for your reply to my mail and I appreciate it, sincerely
to say the fact, I don’t know you and we haven’t met before, I got your email
address when I am doing research on the network in looking for someone who is
reliable and trust to assist me in this transaction so that the money will be
release by the bank and get transfer smooth and successful into your nominated
bank account.

As you can see, I contacted you because the deceased customer is a foreigner,
so the indigene of this country Burkinabe can not come out for the claim as the
next of kin, that is why I am looking for a capable foreigner person that can
help me, And I want you to know that it is a pleasure to get in contact with
you because God as reveal to me to take you as my partner in this transaction
and I promised you that you will never regret in dealing with me but sorry for
this long mail of mine, is for us to understand each other before will go
further in this transaction.

 

I want you to know that this transaction that I am about to introduce to you is
real not fraud or money laundry and you should aware that what we are about to
do need trust and sincerity because without trust and understanding this
transaction will not be successful but if we can cooperate together as one, I
assure you that, we are going to succeed in getting this money transferred to
your bank account not long from now, but the most important is that, this
transaction should be taking as secret and confidential between me and you, you
should not expose this operation to the public for the successful transfer of
this money into your bank account.

And you should understand that very important issue on this transaction for the
successful transfer of this money to your destination, is to have a bank
account where my bank here will transfer the fund into, so if you don’t have a
bank account, I want you to open a new
bank account that we are going to use for this operation or if you
already have an old bank account, there’s no problem about that, if you agree
to released it, we can use it for the successful of this transaction but I will
preferred that you open a new bank
account for more confidence and trust.

My purpose of mailing you is this, I want you to come to this country for you to
believe and for your confirmation that the money is really in the bank account
but if you know that is not possible for you to be present here, it doesn’t
matter, you can stay if you want, all depends on you and I want you to know
that I will visit you in your country when the bank transfer the fund into your
nominated bank account.

And concerning the details of this business, meanwhile, this fund belongs to
one of our bank deceased customer (MR.KURT KAHLE). He died in Concorde air
crashed on 25th of July, 2000 with all his entire family along with his
supposed next of kin He nationalized here for years before his death. He
executed a lot of contracts here before his death and he was also the major
supplier of agricultural equipments in West Africa.
And for you to understand what I am about to do, here is one of the evidence
website of the plane crashed that caused the death of the deceased customer:

 

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm 

 

And the banking law here stipulates that, if such money remains unclaimed after
12 years without nobody for the claim the money will be confiscated and
transfers to the bank treasury as unclaimed fund, I discovered this money during
my last auditing in our department and for the fund not to be confiscated I
need your assistant in claiming the money as the beneficiary to the deceased
customer so I need your urgent assistance to this operation in claiming this
fund before the deadline date 28:02:2013 that they already accorded to the fund
expired.

Firstly, the bank authority have made all the necessary enquiries to find out
if they can get any of his relation so that they will come for the claims but
all is no avail, and is with this opportunity that makes me decided to contact
you so that we will team together and claim this fund that is with the bank so
that the money will be release and get transfer into your bank account, because
I don’t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund and
besides nobody is coming for the fund again. 

Secondly, if this fund goes into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund, we bank
officials don't gain anything on this inheritance fund, it will only be the
benefit of the bank management with the bank administrative council and some
local government council and with this occasion I decided to contact you, for
the mutual benefit of our both families, and I want you to know that this
transaction will undergo normal banking procedures of transferring an
inheritance fund into another destination bank account, you will first apply to
the bank as the nearest person to the deceased customer while I will be here as
your partner in the business, guiding you on what to do until the fund enters
your account successfully.

So if you have decided to do the transaction with me, when I will hear from you
again, I will send you a letter of application that you will send to the
Foreign Remittance Department of this bank in claiming the money as the real next
of kin to the deceased customer, and I assure you that this transaction is 100%
hitch-free on both sides and has no atom of negativity but the most important
is that you must try to keep it confidential and as a top secret until you will
confirm the money in your given bank account as you may wish to know that I am
one of this bank officials, so you should not expose this transaction to
anybody even your best friend should not know about this transaction to avoid
obstacle that can become catastrophe for us in this operation.

And once again, I wish to inform you that 45% of the total sum will be for you
for the provision of an account were the bank here will transfer the money to
and 5% out of the whole amount will be set aside for the expenses that may occur
during the transfer of the money into your bank account and this will be
regulate by the time all the money successful transferred into your nominated
bank account in your direction and 50% will be for me.

I have worked very hard in my life and this one opportunity that I don't want
it to be jeopardized.

And I will like to know how capable that you are to receive this huge amount
into your account, and I hope that you will not betray me when the money will
transfer into your nominated bank account. 

My full name is (Mr Hamed Maiga) Auditing and accounting Unit dept for Society
General of Banks in Burkina (SGBB) I am 49 years old with 3 children and their
mother. And I don't want to lose this last opportunity that God provided,
because opportunity comes once in a live time and I assure you that you will
never regret in dealing with me in this transaction. 

But you must assure me of your sincerity, so that this transaction is not
brought to odium. Please kindly back-out if you can not assure me of your
sincerity in this transaction.

Note that this transaction is 100% Risk Free and there is no atom of negative
on both side, only you will have to keep it secret until you receive the fund
into your nominated bank account. God be with us and our family (AMEN).

Extend my greetings to your family and have a nice day.

Truly Yours,

Mr. Hamed Maiga
