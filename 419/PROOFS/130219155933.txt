My Dear Friend,

Thank you for your response to my appeal for your noble assistance. Also I appreciate your maturity in keeping this transaction as top secret and=A0confidential.=A0

Nonetheless, I wish to assure you that this transaction is highly rewarding and risk-free. You don't have anything to worry about in this transaction because I=A0have been working with this bank for many years and I know all its internal secrets very well. I also have the full conviction that you will neither betray nor=A0disappoint me once this money is transferred into your bank account.

The name of the deceased customer is Dr. John Wilbert; he is an American, a physician and industrialist. He met his sudden death in COTE D' VOIR. On=A0hearing of his death, the bank board of directors set up a three man fact finding committee to investigate and find out the cause of his death and related=A0information's about his family.

I was made a member of the committee and at the end of our assignment we collected information's which included that he died along with his wife and=A0three children, he left the sum of twenty five million five hundred thousand United States dollars ($25,500 000), in his account in the ECOBANK OF AFRICA and did=A0not name his beneficiary, since then the bank had been waiting to see whether any of his relatives could come forward and put claims over his balance in the=A0bank but non showed up.

This is exactly getting to three years he died, the edict establishing this bank states that any such fund (abandoned) that is not claimed within three years=A0will be confiscated or seized and put into the bank's treasury as government fund, unfortunately, the bank directors want to do another thing now by planning=A0to share this fund among themselves as nobody is coming up for the claims.

My good friend, I see this development as a very good opportunity for me to contact you to help me put claim to this fund as his next of kin and accommodate=A0this in your bank account abroad. I know you may doubt the possibility of this, but I am telling you that it is a reality and easy bearing in mind that I was the=A0person who submitted the information of this late bank customer to the bank board of directors. I am in a position to give you all information about this man=A0as the bank may require from you after applying as the next of kin to claim his balance.

On your own part, I want you to keep this as a top secret strictly between you and me only because I am still working in this bank here, if they discover that I=A0was the person who gave you information about this deceased customer, I will loose my job, you are only required to act on my behalf by following my=A0directives as I will be giving you information daily concerning bank decisions towards this transaction.

After receiving your reply, I will send you a text of application which you will re-write and send to our bank here for approval. Including with your phone contact=A0send your country name and code number.

I hope to hear from you soonest.
My private telephone number:
+226 65214690
Thanks and best regards.
Mr. Kayor dafote
