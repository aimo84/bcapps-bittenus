*Dearest in Christ Leonard Zeptowitz

I received and read your letter today with gratitude to GOD. And I am
impressed with your reply and persuaded to fulfil the desire of my late
husband and I, that is why I am trusting and believing your sincerity to
appropriate this accordingly.

I know you are surprise on receiving this letter; In fact, It is also by
the leading of the spirit that I choose you in obedience and love to fulfil
the desire of my late husband that I supported to the glory of God,

I want you to understand that this benevolence is in fulfil ment of the
desire and decision of my late husband which I am persuaded to actualize.
This fund is designated for humanitarian and Charity services with special
emphasis. This must be disbursed with every Appropriation, accountability
and prudence to the glory of God I want you to urgently handle this from
there, so that the donation money will be transferred to you before the
fall of this Country. With my health condition i cannot be capable to
handle this accordingly. Please, I want you to understand that this
benevolence is in fulfilment of the desire and decision of my late husband
which I am persuaded to actualize.

I am writing this letter to you with the assistance of a nurse (Miss.
Blesing Aka) My health condition cannot  permit me to write or answer
telephone call,  but. If you wish to call, here is the hospital telephone
number 00225 09613229 you will speak with my nurse Miss. Blesing Aka

May the Good Lord add more anointing upon you and give your more wisdom to
handle this project to his own Glory. In my next mail i will forward you
the contact information of the Finance company where the fund's was
deposited by my late husband.

I will like to know more about you to be assuring that the donation fund
will be properly use to the glory of God, Kindly forward me your private
telephone number so that my nurse can speak with you on my behalf.

 In Christ J=E9sus

Sister Anturah Daniel Mathews*
