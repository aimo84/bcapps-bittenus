ATTN:FUND BENEFICIARY,

RE:SWIFT TRANSFER OF US$ 1.5 MILLION INTEREST INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

I am DR.CHRISTIAN AKWA ,HEAD OF REMITTANCE DEPT.,GHANA COMMERCIAL BANK (GCB)LTD. This is the second time we are notifying you about your over-due funds. Sometime ago,In the Memorandum of Understanding(MOU)It was revealed in your file as your name was penciled as the bonafide beneficiary to receive your over-due funds which was brought to our bank from the Economic Community of west African States (ECOWAS) In collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF)

We wish to inform you that the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) finally resolved the issue in London after one week meeting and decided to pay all out-standing funds payment of US$1,500,000.00(One Million Five Hundred United States Dollars Only) via Swift Telegraphic Wire Transfer(KTT)or swift Online Transfer for onwards payment into your account,which the government is incurring deficit and we are indebted to pay all OVER-DUE funds without any further impediment.

Henceforth,All the previous banks, should submit their payment files due to their bureaucratic activities and inability to release these funds as scheduled by sending you a transfer confirmation slip to enable you notify your bank about the incoming funds into your designated bank account without any further delay.

As a matter of fact ,we do not have enough time to waste since we have wasted much time in contacting our respective customers, so try and comply with the essential remittance requirements to ensure the swift release of these funds into your account. Example, your international passport or your drivers license, your telephone and fax number for easy communication with your designated bank details.

Endeavor to call on Tel:+233-509773444 ,Fax:+233-261557461,E-mail: info.gcb.ghana@postafiok.hu ,to ensure the swift transfer of these funds.

We await your prompt reply as soon as possible.
