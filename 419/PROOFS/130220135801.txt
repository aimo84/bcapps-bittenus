I got your mail. Where you are staying does not matter in this
transaction because you can still be in your country and handle the
transaction.Note that the customer is not your relation but it is very
fortunate that you share almost the same name with the deceased which
will make the UBS Investment bank to approve your claim on your behalf
and transfer the fund when the fund are approved on your behalf. This
transaction is 100% legal,and it will be backed up with some court
legal documents.I am the account officer of the customer in the UBS
Investment bank before his death,so i will make you his next of kin by
attaching your data in the customers account records in the bank.

Note that the total fund in question is Fifteen Million Five Hundred
Thousand pounds. The ratio of the sharing is 50/50

First of all i need to insert your data in the account record of the
deceased so that it will be easy for the UBS bank to approve your
claim.

I need you to provide the below information s

. Full Contact Address.
. Your company=92s name and address
. Your mobile telephone number
. Position in your company
. A scanned copy of your identity

Upon receipt of this information as I requested above, I will insert
your information in the deceased accounting information in UBS
Investment so that it will be easier for the bank to confirm the
claim. Also i will go to High court here in London to procure some
claim legal document on your behalf like letter of
administration,affidavit of fact and inheritance tax certificate.These
documents will help in this transaction,the UBS bank will definitely
approve the claim as soon as they view these documents.

Finally, I wish to assure you that none of the information above will
be misused for anything outside this transaction. Your information
will be strictly for this transaction and will be kept secret.

Note that we have a time limit to execute this transaction so i will
expect you to be answering my emails as quickly as you can.

You can be calling me on +447700075944 at any time,i will be there to
answer your call.
