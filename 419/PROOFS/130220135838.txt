Dear Partner and friend,Thanks for your prompt and urgent response. I must say my spirit has been lifted since I received your mail and to know that you are much concerned about my health. I have taken my time to read and study the steps and instructions you gave. I shall try to follow them step by step but at the moment I am receiving treatment for my Heart problem.It might intimate you to know that I have tried various meds to help subdue my weight all to no avail. You wont be able to know the number of lives we can impact with this project. But I think we need to get to know ourselves better before we proceed further on this project. Here are some information about me.You can check on this wikipedia page to get a proper understanding of me.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gina_RinehartI am Mrs Georgina Hope Rinehart of Hancock Prospecting Property Limited(HPPL), a citizen of Australia.I am worth an estimated 29.17 billion Australian dollars which ranks me as the Richest person in Australia and the Richest woman in the world.Life has given me my own share of its misfortunes.I have been married twice, divorced the first and the second died few years into the marriage. I have four kids who have engaged me in legal battles over the years over trusteeship of my fathers trustfund. but the greatest of my woes is that I am suffering from a weight problem that has affected my heart and my doctors say I have a very short time to live.I do not want to leave my enormous wealth behind for my wayward kids, hence I want to use part of my wealth for charity, the others I have willed to my loyal staffs. This fund is an estimated ($200,000,000.00) Two Hundred Million Dollars .I want to establish a foundation with your help to reach out to the less privilege, orphans and homeless people around the world.Due to my state of health its only with your cooperation and efforts that this project can see the light of day. So I use this medium to implore you to do all you have to make this a reality.I may not live to see the realization of this project but I have implicit confidence that you would be able to complete this humanitarian project at all cost. Attached to this mail are copies of my photographs and my international passport, I shall provide you with an agreement document prepared by my Legal Counsel for you to sign your own part of the agreement in my next letter as soon as I get your required data.I would expect same gesture from you so that we can proceed further. Your details would also be required by my Legal Counsel to prepare cover documents for this project.Please reply with the under listed details:NAME....................................SEX.....................................AGE..................................MOBILE NUMBER..........OCCUPATION...................ADDRESS........................COUNTRY..........................Get back to me in the nearest possible time.  Mrs Gina Rinehart.
