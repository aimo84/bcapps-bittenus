This automatically will be shared amongst the owners [directors and share holders] of my company who is looking out for this kind of opportunities. Similar things have been happening in the past and now that I am well placed, it is hard for me to continue to allow it happen without doing a thing about it. Part of my motive is to spend more than half of my personal share after these funds are wired to your account on charity. I can assure you that with the way I have planned this transaction, we can never have any kind of problems during and after this transaction. I will not like to put my name and family name in jeopardy and cannot think of loosing all that I have worked for instead, I would prefer to remain a poor man. I have studied your country's
