My Dearest one In Christ,=A0Greetings to you, i am very happy for your quick response to my mail, =A0well i am not afraid of the death because i knows where i am heading to, Rev 21;vs 4 really strengthen my faith, my only problem is to see the desire of my late husband come to accomplishment now that i am alive, so dearly one in Christ i want you to assure me that you will never let the trust i have in you down, that you will use the fund accordingly to the will of the Almighty God.=A0I know you will be surprise in receiving this letter, but as a servant of the living God, you should know that our ways is not his ways, my Bible tells me that God works in many ways and all things works out for good to them that believed in Christ Jesus, all i need from you is to assure me that you will never betray the trust i am trying to entrust in your hand for the work of God, you may asked me how i got across your email, the bible said that who is me is greater than who
 of the world, the Holy Spirit that leads me to you will never let us down only if you can believe with faith.=A0Please, I want you to understand that this benevolence is in fulfillment of the desire and decision of my late husband which I am persuaded to actualize, this fund is designated for humanitarian and Charity services with special emphasis, which must be disbursed with every appropriation, accountability and prudence to the glory of God.=A0Meanwhile, I could have donate this money here in my country, but the reason is that before the death of my late beloved husband he warned me not to let his relatives know about this money because they are unbelievers and he don't want an atom of this money to be use in anything ungodly, and i don't intend to disobey him even in death.=A0I will want you to send to me your full names and address to enable me swear an affidavit on oath on your behalf that will officially and legally approve you as the new
