Thanks for your attention and response to my message. I really appreciate.
I got your message but you may not understand the reason of the message I
sent to you. Let me use this opportunity to brief you more on the matter.
You have to know in anything that happened in life there is always a
reason. I  want you to read this letter carefully to understand.  I
contacted you for an assistant to claim the money deposited by my late
client Engr.Jao Zeptowitz  this deposit was made in 1999 and he died in
2006, I am his legal adviser here so I was aware of everything. I had
received notification from this bank initially since on the  04/08/2007 to
present an available next of kin/ beneficiary of that fund or they the bank
will confiscate the entire fund if I fail.

But there was no record of this man relatives here after the tragic
accident that took him and his family, though inquires has been made to
locate his relatives but all efforts failed, so as things maybe, and there
is no other option,that is why I use this medium and fortunately for me I
come in contact with you. I want you to cooperate  with me to claim this
money left by my late client. We are to benefit, because this is the only
opportunity and availability to claim this money with this bank  since you
bear same surname.

I do not know about the relatives of this man and I do not say he is your
relatives, basically my contact with you is about the money he  left with
this bank. If you will understand and accept to cooperate with me, I am
going to back you with available information of that deposit to enable you
contact and  communicate with this bank for the release of that fund.  I
want to assure you that, there is nothing like risk or crime in this
matter. For me it is not good to lose this  money to bank just like that,
this is the reason I want us to claim it, I have facts and evidence of this
matter of which I am ready to present for you to contact this bank as the
beneficiary of that fund.

The amount is $14.3 Million, and the process of claiming this money is by
information. .......You have to understand It is a standard practice with
corporation and financial institutions, when over a specified period of
time if there  has not been any activity on deposits, and the holder of the
funds cannot locate the owner or in case of death. This is where financial
institutions and corporation absorbed  unclaimed accounts as profits and
the money will lost forever to the rightful owner.

Now you can see that the specified period of time of this deposit is due to
declare it unclaimed account by this bank since nobody has put claim on it,
that is why the bank  gave me notification to present available
beneficiary, so if something is not done fast the whole money will be lost,
because fund is now void. But you have to note, I did not  master mind the
death of Engr.Jao Zeptowitz, his death was an unfortunate incident, I have
done what I suppose to do and it is not my making that nobody has  come to
claim this money since, as his banking information is still with me and no
(will) was written before his his death.

So if I have this opportunity and allow it to slip away, then I must be a
foolish man, as long as we are not hurting anybody, I don't see anything
wrong in what we are about to  do, you can drawn your judgement from this
explanation, then if you decide to cooperate with me. Please indicate by
your positive response to enable us proceed.

We will cooperate together as partners and work with sincere heart,
openness and trust; that will be only our key to success in this matter.
Note if at the end of this project and this money is in your account,
everything will have to be shared in percentages You will be entitle to 50%
of the total fund, while 50% will also be for me.  Do you agree with that?
or if we agree the money can be invested in your area of business expertise
in your country jointly to be managed.

I look forward to read from you positively. Do take care and remain blessed.

Yours faithfully
Barr.Aziz Richard (Esq)
