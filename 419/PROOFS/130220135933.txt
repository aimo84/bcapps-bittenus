Dear Friend.

How are you once together with your family i hope all is well glory be to God?
I saw the mail you sent to me also I thanks you so much for your
effort I appreciate your understanding.
Morever I have gone through your mail and understood the contents
please i dont want you to fill any atoms of fear. Also let you
understand the reason why i want to transfer this fund out from this
bank. Mr John Korovo is every good man to me, also all his deposited
file is in my office. before his dead, Mr John Korovo and his family=92s
died which no one come to claim this fund, it has been a painful thing
to me after the bank audit which I find out that this fund will
transfer into the bank treasury account as unclaimed fund since no one
come to claim it, and the account has been dormant since somany years,
please do this urgently respond to the bank; any time from now before
this fund will return to bank treasury account.
Dear I have done the investigation over this fund on how to work out
this fund so that it will not transfer into bank account, after my
investigations.
As, I=92am the indigene of Burkina faso I can not be the next of the kin
to the decease customer. More Reason, I work in the same bank I know
all the information=92s, It is only a foreigner can stand as next of
kin. which next of kin can come out from any place example from friend
or in-law or from his business patiner.
However, bank did not know any of the family of the decease customer
and the next of kin been registered died along with his families.
Dear in the name of God the only help we can give to this man is to
help him share this fund to motherless baby also to the people that do
not have. The poor people around in the word peoples in need. In fact
I know that if this fund transfer into bank account it will only use
to the country which will not be as it supposed be good use on it,
example it can be use to sponsor terrorise or war.dear in my first
mail I mention about the offers, please let us help the poor. I am
giving you 100% asurance.hence this fund is in my care. The entire
files regarding to this fund is with me which i will change
authomaticaly to your name. now I can advise you on one thing to
improve my innocent you can open new account in any bank as you like
and send the information to me if you still have atoms of fear. I
promised you hence I am a banker, in the same bank you will not put
any of your money in this transaction till you receive this fund into
your account.the only thing I need from you is to up date me what ever
you might receive from the bank so that I will advise you on what to
do so that you will not make any mistake. If any information from the
bank i will update you in time.
The only thing and my interest is how to make sure that this fund will
use in a better thing Even if to use all the fund to sacrifice to the
poor I will be very greatful than to use it in bad Provisions,
moreover I want you to give me your private phone number immediately
as soon as i get any urgent information from the bank i will call you
and advise you on what to do.expenses, from the bank, if bank ask you
any money, do not pay let me know i will advise you on what to do, I
do not need you to spend any of your money, but you have to be fast to
update me. Any money request here do not pay i know on what to do.
Thanks and God bless you and you=92re entire family.
