Dear Partner,

  

Good morning. Hope all is
well with you and your family? If so, God is great. but before we can proceed
further in this transaction in claiming the money as the real beneficiary to the
deceased customer, you should go through this mail and get back to me.

  

My purpose of mailing you
is this, this transaction that I am introducing to you, is real not fraud and I
assure you that you will never regret in dealing with me, and if you follow my
instructions and also by following the bank management instructions by the time
you will apply to the bank as the beneficiary to the deceased customer, the
money will successful transfer into your bank account, and I want you to know
that the whole amount will be transfer gradually into your bank account without
no problem from your authorities.  

  

  

I want you to know that
you are dealing with a reputable man, and as I told you earlier, I can't
involve myself in a deal that will ruin my reputations, my dreams are to be a
senator or governor in this country in near future and I don’t want anything to
jeopardise it and you should be aware that the money will be transfer stage by
stage into your bank account, even when my bank here is about to transfer the
first payment of the money into your bank account, they will ask you how much
you want them to transfer into your bank account in each stage of transfer for
successful and perfect transfer of the money into the bank account that you
will provide to the bank management for the transaction. 

   

We have to trust in each
other and I am promising you that you will never regret it. I believe that the
money to spend in the transaction will not be a problem for us because we are
capable to cover some little expenses during the course of the transfer for the
obtaining the legal document that will back up this claim in the Ministry of
Justice in your name as the beneficiary next of kin to the deceased customer
and if it happen that expenses occurred as mentioned, is between me and you to
take care and share the expenses between each other and pay but I assure you
that is a little expenses that we both can afford to pay, so if you know that you
are ready to cooperate with me in this transaction, you should let me know
because there's no time to waste.  

  

But the most important
thing is to have 100% trusts and confident in each other and I promise you that
the sky will be our limit. And I will like you to make me confirmed that you
will not betray me when this money will be transfer to your bank account in
your country to enable me be directing you  on the procedure that follow
before claiming this money as the beneficiary next of kin to the deceased
customer.  

  

I assure you that the
money will be transfer in our favour into your nominated bank account without
no problem from the authorities who wanted to know about the origin of this
fund, because all the legal documents that will back up this deceased customer
bank account that will make you to qualifier as the next of kin to the deceased
customer will be obtained in your name.

transaction without delay and to enable me send to you the application letter
that you will send to the bank in claiming the fund as the beneficiary to the
deceased customer. Thanks.
