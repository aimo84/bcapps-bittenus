Good Day!

My Dear Friend=2C

My Reward to Your Help (Compensation)

I am very happy to inform you about my success in getting those fund transferred to a Swiss Account with the cooperation of a new partner from London who is an international businessman. Presently I am in London for investment projects with my own share of the total sum after the transfer of the fund to here in London . Meanwhile=2C I did not forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.

Now contact our Rev.Pastor Samuel Benjamin=2C he is the person that connected me to the good business man that helped me. So contact him with the below information

Name:       Rev.Pastor Samuel Benjamin
Email:      christmissionchapelministry01@hotmail.com   =20
State:      Ouagadougou
Country:    Burkina Faso

Ask him to send you the wrapped parcelled envelope which I dropped in his parish for you. I felt confident and dropped this envelop containing the cheque of Eight Hundred  and fifty thousand United States Dollars ( $850=2C000.00USD) because the pastor is a man of GOD=2C moreover I did not disclose to him that it is an open cheque=2C that is contained in the parcel. I only told him that someone will reach him for the collection. I felt very happy to show you this compensation as a token of my appreciation for all the past efforts and attempt to assist me in this matter though all effort proved abortive during the process of everything.

I appreciate your efforts at that time very much. So feel free and get in touch with the parish. Pastor Samuel Benjamin and instruct him where to send the package to you. Please do let me know immediately you receive it so that we can share the joy after all the efforts at that time. At the moment=2C I am very busy here because of the investment projects=2C which the new partner and I are having at hand at the moment=2C and I am waiting your mail as soon as you received the cheque from Rev.Pastor Samuel Benjamin.

Finally=2C remember that I had forwarded instruction to the Reverend on your behalf for you to receive the parcelled cheque=2C so feel free to get in touch with him and he will send the parcel to you without any delay. Once again=2C I am happy that everything went successfully as planned with the help of my new partner and also I am rewarding you for all your kind efforts in the past to help me.

With best love from me here in London =2C

Thanks=2C
Dr. Hassan Ahmed=20
