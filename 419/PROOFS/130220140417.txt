Thank you very much for acknowledging my last e-mail.Certainly=2C we shall meet soon as this process is completed.
Having concluded the legal documentation process=2C i wish to acquint you with the next step and Of course as my client=2C you will have to take the best advise from me. At this point=2C you must first take full custody of the funds from the bank where its currently lodged.
I have very good news from the probate office=2C our application which was placed on the notice board did not record any query. The probate order has been issued and I have attached the scanned copy to this email for your perusal.  Now under the present circumstances=2C you are now well placed to claim the bequeathed funds successfully. The final figure given by my late client's bankers is $23=2C500=2C000 which includes the initial deposit of $US22=2C500=2C000 and the interest the funds yielded.
The last few days have been very stress-full=2C because I had no way of determining the outcome.At present=2C your contact details (name=2C address=2C phone number) are in your claims file which has now been submitted to the holding bank=2C so all you have to do is contact the bank as supposed to setup a Non resident account where the funds will be deposited into the account in your name.You can sure handle the process from here as i have been able to get the necessary documents perfected so you have nothing to worry about.
 So all you will have to do is to setup the account in your name so that the funds can be freely deposited into your new account with the bank. And once your account is activated=2C you will receive the account details (online Lo-gin details and password) which gives you complete access to your funds where you can safely transfer your inheritance to your local home account.
find below the contact information of the bank.
