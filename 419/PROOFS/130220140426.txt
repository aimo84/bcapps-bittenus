Presently we are in Iran for investment projects with my own share of the total sum. Meanwhile, I didn't forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.

Dear I will never forget your love and your care in the time of mine tribulation i wish you all the best in life as I was about sending some money to Africa to improve the life of people. I have decided to write you a draft of $400.000.00 usd for your compensation and your love. I appreciate every thing no matter you did not succeed due to one thing or the other .I want you to contact the Rev father cubua sahm, who is in charge of christ the king parish now to receive your draft, Bellow is his email address. revfrcubua@yahoo.fr
