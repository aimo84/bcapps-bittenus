Dear Leonard Zeptowitz ,

I received your e-mail with thanks.As I did explain to you on my first
message that I am a banker by profession from and currently holding the
post of Manager, Bill and Exchange Department of my bank. I have the
opportunity of transferring the left over funds ($5.5million) belonging to
one of my bank's clients who died along with his entire family on 26 Dec.,
2003 in a plane crash.

The transfer is bank-to bank and should be made to your chosen foreign
account from our head office here in Accra.

The modalities I have mapped out to actualize the transfer of the fund
involves the following steps:

Step1: I will program your full names and address on the entire database as
the depositor and the beneficiary of the fund.

Step2: I shall issue a backdated deposit slip of the fund in your name.

Step3: I shall provide you with a draft of an application for transfer that
you are going to forward to our Head office since all International
transfers are carried out from there.

With the above steps,our head office will immediately carry out the
transfer of the fund to your chosen bank account.

Such transfers from our Head Office takes not more than 72hrs.I would like
to stress that this transaction would cause no grief to either of us. The
scenario involved here is similar to that of a person who banks with a
particular bank and at a point in time, wishes to close his  account or
transfer the fund to another bank of his choice.

With your names duly programmed on the Database of the bank, you are
practically a customer of our bank.

There is no risks involved in this transaction hence I am here to make sure
that everything works out.

All is needed from you is to follow my instructions until the fund hits
your account,In your response, please include your full contact
details,including

1.Your full names

2.Your complete physical country address

3.Your Occupation and Age/Sex

4.Your direct Mobile Number  for easy communication.

I would need them in all the above steps.

Regards,
Mr.Ibrahim Mantu
