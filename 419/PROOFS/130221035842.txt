Attention:&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonard Zeptowitz,
We have a fund domiciled in an escrow account in our bank that is in your name in UK. The source of this fund is considered to be from the USA but it could have come from other sources via UK en-route to USA because it was returned to our bank in your name, and since then it has been lying dormant.
Our bank was planning on confiscating the fund, but i stopped that move citing that it was an error transaction detail that caused the fund been returned and a proper application not been applied for its transfer again. So i was told to contact the beneficiary, hence my contacting you now. Because i can help guide you on how this fund will be transferred to you without any hitch, and without your government raising an eyebrow either on suspicion of money laundering or tax evasion.
I will ensure all this grey areas are covered so that the fund can be in your bank account, with the believe that there must be something in it from you for me. Once you revert back to me, i will guide you on how you will officially write our bank for the funds release and transfer to you either in bits or whole funds.
Waiting to hear from you.
Regards,
Steven
