Hello Dearest Leonard,

Thanks for responding to my email, Please accept my sincere apologies if my email does not meet your business or personal ethics, I really like to have a good relationship with you, and I have a special reason why I decided to contact you because of the urgency of my situation here.

Please I write not only to introduce myself to you, but also tender a joint investment business proposal for your considerations and acceptance. I know that receipt of my communication shall be a great surprise to you considering the fact that we did not know each other or had any business negotiations before now, I am also aware of the fact that there is a lot of fraudulent business proposals circulating around the world, which makes it imperative for one to be extremely careful before accepting and venturing any business proposal from unfamiliar person like me.

I however, pray your respected self not to allow the above unnatural abnormalities to influence your decision to accept my genuine proposal and intentions which undoubtedly would be of immense mutual benefits to both of us. I pledge to you for urgent and dedicated attention which this issue deserves.

I deem it necessary to introduce myself in detail for you and the need for your assistance to claim and invest my inheritance for me, I am Miss. Ellen Hindolo Trye, 24years old girl from Republic of Sierra Leone, the only daughter of late former Minister of Tourism and Cultural Affairs a position he carried with diligence until he was later appointed Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Security (MLESS) where he served until his death , Mr. Hindolo Sumanguru Trye, who died on July 26, 2012 on the way to Choitram=E2=80=99s Hospital less than an hour ago while being rushed there for treatment, after taking ill. He was declared Dead on Arrival.

I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment I' am receiving from my step mother. She planned to take away all my late fathers treasury and properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father.

Meanwhile I wanted to escape to the Europe but she hide away my international passport and other valuable traveling documents. Luckily they did not discover where I kept my Fathers File which contains important documents. So I decided to run to the Charity home where I am presently seeking asylum under the United Nations High Commission for the Charity home here in Dakar Republic of Senegal. I wish to contact you personally for a long term business relationship and investment assistance in your country.

My father secretly deposited the sum of US$4,850, 000.00 in one of the prime bank with my name as the next of kin . However, I shall forward you with the necessary information of the deposit on confirmation of your acceptance to assist me for the transfer and investment of the fund in your country. As you will also help me in an investment, and I will like to complete my studies, as I was in the school in Freetown-Sierra Leone, before the death of my father.

It is my intention to compensate you with 20% of the total money for your services and the balance shall be my investment capital. This is the reason why I decided to contact you. Please all communications should be through this email address only for confidential purposes. As soon as I receive your positive response showing your interest I will put things into action immediately. In the light of the above, I shall appreciate an urgent message indicating your ability and willingness to handle this transaction sincerely.

I am staying at the female hostel 0037. Awaiting your urgent and positive response. Please do keep this only to your self please I advice you not to disclose it to a third party till I come over, once the fund has been transferred into your account. I hope my explanation is very clear but if you need further clarification, then send in your questions.

Thanks as I hope to receive from you soon.

Yours Sincerely
Miss. Ellen Hindolo Trye.
