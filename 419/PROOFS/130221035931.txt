My name is Marcus Donald from England=3B I have been diagnosed with =0Aprostate and esophageal cancer that was discovered very late due to my =0Alaxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all form of medicine and =0Aright now=2C I have only about a few months to live according to medical =0Aexperts. I have not particularly lived my life so well=2C as I never =0Areally cared for anyone not even myself but my business.

Though I=0A am very rich=2C I was never generous=2C I was always hostile to people and =0Aonly focus on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But =0Anow I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just=0A wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God =0Agives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a =0Adifferent way from how I have lived it. Now that I know my time is near=2C=0A I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my =0Aimmediate and extended family members and as well as a few close =0Afriends.

I have decided to give alms to charity organizations=2C as=0A I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far=2C I =0Ahave distributed money to some charity organizations around the world. =0ANow that my health has deteriorated so badly=2C I cannot do this my self =0Aany more. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts =0Aand donate the money=2C which I have there to a charity home=2C they refused=0A and kept the money to themselves. Hence=2C I do not trust them anymore=2C =0Aas they seem not to be contented with what I have left for them.

The=0A last of my money which is the huge cash deposit that I have with a =0Afinancial institute abroad. I will want you to help me collect this =0Adeposit and dispatched it to charity organizations. I am writing this =0Afrom my laptop computer in my bedroom where I wait for my time to come. I=0A pray that God uses you to support and assist me with good heart=2C thanks=0A and looking forward to hear from you. Have a nice day.

God bless.
