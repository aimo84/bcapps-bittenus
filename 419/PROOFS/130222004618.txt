Dear,
=0A
=0AThank =0Ayou so much for your response, we don't understand the word that you are =0Abroke? but all we know is that you will not=C2=A0regret assisting us and we =0Apray that this will be an enduring =0Arelationship that will last from generation to generation. We know that =0Ayou may be surprised to receive our mail since we have not met before. =0AHowever, we would like you to accept it in good faith and sincerity of =0Apurpose since we contacted you based on Divine guidance. Everything =0Aworks for good to them that trust and love God.
=0A
=0AAs I =0Asaid before, our heart is broken because of our situation here we are =0Apassing through after the wicked murder of our dear parents, It is not =0Aeasy for us to take the decision to give you the trust of making you our=0A guardian and trusting the money which is our only hope for future in =0Ayour hands. But there is nothing we can do, it is our condition now that=0A make it that we must trust you=0A so that this money will be transferred out according to the agreement =0Aand instruction my late father gave the bank the day he deposited the =0Afund with the bank. All we needed from you is not only for the money to =0Abe transferred into your bank account and for you to serve as our father=0A in the lord and start directing our affairs from hence fort and we =0Areally hope that you will wipe away our tears. And from the message you =0Asent to us we really don=E2=80=99t understand you well but we know that God =0Adirected us to you to assist us in this transfer and we prayed before =0Acontacting you.
=0A
=0AWe will like to continue our studies =0Awhich is our top priority, I was studying library science/sociology in =0Athe federal University Freetown Sierra Leone but stopped my education in=0A my part one when my father died and my sister Maria just finished her =0Asecondary education before the death of our dear parents and we had to =0Aleave Sierra Leone to Cote d`Ivoire to seek=0A for the release of the money of my late father deposited here on my =0Abehalf as the next of kin as I explain in my last mail. No condition is =0Apermanent says a proverb, because if in my life someone will tell me =0Athat one that I will be looking for help of any kind I will not believe =0Athe person, because when our father was alive everything is very =0Acomplete for us, but now things has fall apart as the center cannot hold=0A again, you can imagine eating in the palace today and the next day on =0Athe street, it is unbearable, I have decided to reply this mail and =0Abelieve that we will not be betrayed and disappointed.
=0A
=0APlease=0A kindly note that because of my age and inexperience and because my =0Afather is not alive we can not finalize this transfer issue with the =0Abank alone. We want your to help us represent us in the bank as our =0Aguardian Trustee.=C2=A0 We will introduce your to the bank as=0A business partner of our late father so that=0A the bank will know that my late father have mature somebody so they =0Awill respect you and transfer the money quick to your account as you =0Awill instruct the bank.
