Thank you very much for your response. I appreciate the fact that you are ready to assist me in executing this project. I look forward to meeting you. All further correspondence to me should be channeled through this email address.

  Before I am able to give out the information that will enable you access the funds to proceed with this investment project, I would need you to send your names and residential address and also a scan copy of your valid identity. These information will enable a legal attorney here prepare documentation changing ownership of my client's funds to your name before the funds are released to you for investment.

 Also you will be expected to explain the area of investment you intend going into with my client's $28m USD and the success rate which you intend to achieve. I hope you are familiar with the situation of my client and because of his incarceration he is unable to invest and control this funds hence the need to have someone with a business acumen to take custody and invest the funds profitably.

 I am trying to get a  phone line that will be very secured . My telephones lines could be intercepted easily, so they are not safe for the project. This is why I want to acquire another phone for this transaction.I will send the number to you as soon as I get it.  I have to ensure that everything is just between you and I. Please ensure that you keep this project confidential, do not discuss it with anybody for security reasons so as not to add to the political quagmire that Mr. Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky finds himself. Your total devotion and trust is needed in this transaction.

 Will endeavor to give you a call on receipt of your mail. Your quick response is expected and for documentation to commence.

Regards
Michael Weare
