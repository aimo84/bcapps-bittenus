*Attention: Leonard Zeptowitz*

This is Andy Ojei, Executive Director, Zenith Bank Plc. I write to bring to
your notice as a delegate from the Nigerian Government Reimbursement
committee under the strict supervision of the United Nations to pay Five
Thousand Nigerian 419 scam victims the sum of $1.5million US dollars each.
You are however listed as one of the beneficiaries for these payments. You
are expected to get back to us for your immediate reimbursement. As a
result of this laudable recommendations, you are hereby informed that
during the last U.N. meeting held in Abuja, Nigeria, it was alarmed so much
by the rest of the world on the lose of funds by various foreigners to the
scam artists operating in syndicates all over the world today.

In other to redeem the good image of our country, the President has ordered
the immediate payment of $1.5million each to the affected victims in
accordance with the U.N. recommendations. Due to the corrupt and
inefficient Banking Systems in Nigeria, these payments are to be made by
ZENITH BANK ANNEX, United States as the corresponding paying bank under the
funding assistance of the Central Bank of Nigeria.

Presently, Two Thousand Five Hundred Beneficiaries have been paid, more
than 50% of the Victims are from the United States, while about 40% are
from other parts of the world. Your particulars were among those mentioned
by some of the Syndicates That were apprehended in Lagos, Nigeria as one of
the victims of the operations, you are hereby warned not to communicate or
duplicate this message to anybody for any reason whatsoever.

It is my pleasure to inform you that I got your mail with the information's
attached to it and the content was well understood. I write to confirm to
you that your Draft is with me here, which I have been waiting to hear from
you as to direct me on how to send the Draft to you. I received the
information that you sent and your Bank Draft is prepared and ready to be
sent out, but I want to inform you what you need to know the four ways in
which you can receive this your payment.

**Courier Delivery (Requires Courier Charges)
*Electronic Wire Transfer (Requires Commission on Transfer)
*Online Transfer through our official website (Requires a valid Zenith Bank
Account, You can apply if you don't possess an a Zenith Bank Account)
*ATM Card Issuance (Requires Processing and Courier Charges)*

In its decision the Governing Council established basic principles for the
distribution of compensation payments to successful claimants. This
decision was made two months before the resolution of the first installment
of claims before the Commission. As stated in the Secretary-General=92s
report, it was anticipated that the value of approved awards would far
exceed the resources available in the Compensation Fund at any given time.
The Governing Council therefore devised a mechanism for the allocation of
available funds to successful claimants.

However, your are required to reconfirm  the required information below:

*NAME:....................................
AGE:........................................
SEX:.......................................
ADDRESS:............................
EMAIL:...................................
PHONE:..................................
OCCUPATION:....................
MONTHLY SALARY:..............
AGE:.........................................
COMPANY:............................
COUNTRY:.............................
SCANNED COPY OF ID:.....*

Our agreement with the United Nations is to pay over 220 people and what
they wanted was for this whole 220 people to come down here this country
and receive their payments themselves, then my bank thought of a better and
faster solution which is to send your Bank Draft through courier service or
have it deposited into the beneficiary's bank account and transferred
online only only if the beneficiary can handle the little fees.

To prove the authenticity of your compensation I have scanned and send you
specimen copy of your  Zenith Bank Compensation Bank Draft. Furthermore,  a
few list of tracking numbers you can track from UPS website to confirm
people like you who have received their payment successfully:-
