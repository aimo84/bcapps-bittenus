Dear Friend ,Leonard Zeptowitz

Thank you for your response to my message to you.I was very glad to read
your mail and
I quickly called you to confirm though the phone rang without answer.
understand that this transaction is real and it is going to take a legal
procedure because I foresee the deposit of the said fund with my bank but
since I am a civil servant working with the same bank, I can not directly
be connected to the fund and that is why I deposited it in what we called
Escrow Call Account without a beneficiary, so now you are standing as the
owner and depositor of the fund.

I want you to stand as the original depositor of the said fund and apply
for the transfer of the fund to your bank account for our benefits. All
that is left which is why I contacted you is to stand as the original
depositor of the fund and to(HANDLE THE NOTARIZATION FOR ME), which will
reflect the real owner or depositor of the fund which I can not be able to
do to avoid my head office to know that I am involved in this transaction
because I am still serving with the bank like I told you and if my head
office realized that I am involved in this transaction, they will seize the
fund and my work will be on the line too. I want you to give this
transaction your trust and sincerity because we can not achieve it without
trust and sincerity because the basis of any business achieved is trust and
sincerity.

I will please ask you not to entertain any fear at all as this transaction
is going to work out as long as you follow my instructions. What I mean by
practically no risk is that there is no risk involved in the transaction
because I deposited the fund and will be here to guide you as we proceed so
that you will make no mistakes. Also, this fund will be transferred to your
bank account legally which is why the bank will request that your document
must be notarized at the high court of justice as the legal procedure of
this transaction.

All I need from you is to stand as the original depositor of the fund and
to handle the notarization for me which I can not be able to handle because
it will reflect the real or original depositor of the fund and I am going
to programme your full information in the computer data base of the bank in
my office as the original depositor of the fund.

I do not want OUR HEAD OFFICE //INTERNATIONAL REMITTANCE to realize that I
know anything about this transaction since they are not aware of the source
of the fund. You and i is the only people that knows about this fund and I
promise you that no one is going to request for any other thing from you
here than to transfer the fund to your bank account immediately without any
delays as soon as the notarization is taking care of.

I do not want to waste any of our time because time is very important. If
you agree to work with me and to help me in handling the notarization as I
can not be able to do that because my head office is going to request for
it,which i believe you have accepted.

In regards to your acceptance  to be the owner and depositor of the fund
it  has prompted me to computerize the information which you will provided
to me as requested in the letter which you have read in the computer data
system of our bank Archives in my office VERY IMPORTANT as the original
depositor of the fund.I have also procured an Application form  which I
will send to you to fill and send to my head office(International
Remittance Department) to commence with the transfer of the fund to your
bank account immediately because that is where every international
transactions takes place.So i desire your approval before endorsing these
information's of yours.

As soon as I hear from you, I will send the application letter to you.

Hope you will understand and act accordingly so that we can proceed to
achieve the fund into your bank account without any delays.

Wait for your urgent response.

Thank you once more and remain blessed.

Best Wishes,

Mr. Ben Adams
