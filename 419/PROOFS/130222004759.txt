You need a services of a Legal practitioner here in the United Kingdom to help you pick up the draft
donation insure and send it to you and send a copy your Bank for disbursement. You do not need anyone asking you to send bank account details to transfer any money because it's fake. Have a lovely day ahead.

The internet is very controversial place for information because the bad and the good use it as a medium of communication. We can't stop the bad people from using the internet that is why you must report any mail suspected to be scam email so that the internet surface can pick that info out and tagged it for good.
