Dear  Leonard

I guess this might sound strange to you receiving an email from on unknown
person. To formally introduce myself , I am Mr.Wendy Coleman  a Financial
consultant here in UK . Unfortunately one of my late customer's Albert L
Zeptowitz,   who was  a property magnate and building contractor passed
away with his wife and only son in an air disaster some years back.

Upon his death nobody has laid a claim on his estate {fund} of 12.7Million
British Pounds Sterling  unfortunately, his son being the only heir died
along with them in the crash, leaving a vacuum to be filled. Presently, the
bank where my late customer deposited the fund has planned to confiscate
this fund after the expiration of a certain period by invoking abandoned
property degree of 1936 in accordance with the law of United Kingdom.

It is in light of this, I decided to communicate with you considering that
you shares the same last/surname  with my late customer putting you in a
perfect position to be identify as his relation/business associate ,.
Knowing obviously that you are not, in any way, related to him, my
intention is to be in partnership with you, to enable me present you to his
bank as the heir to his estate

The fund, totaling 12.7Million British Pounds Sterling will be shared in
the ratio of 50% for you, 40% for me while 10% set aside to defray all cost
arising in the
execution of this transaction.

It is not disputable that  you might have been  receiving  difference
business proposal/lottery wining prize  possible on daily basis in your
inbox, spam or junk in view of the fraudulent /scam email flying on the
internet which a lot of person(s) have been victimize whereby discouraging
a lot of people from identifying real transaction that will enable them to
meet with their fortunes and get acquainted with outside world

I hereby assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free and will be
conducted in a legitimate manner without any financial misconduct. I should
respect your trust on me as the financial adviser to the late client.

Kindly contact me immediately by furnishing me with your complete
Information

1) Age,
2) Direct phone number
3) Mobile phone number
4) Nature of job/position,
5) Marital status
6) Address

On receipt of your response, I will send you the documents pertaining to
the deposit of the fund and engage the service of an attorney to carry out
the legal documentation that will compel the bank to recognize you as the
next of kin and release the fund to you.

Yours sincerely,
 Mr.Wendy Coleman
