Hello Dear,

How are you? I thank you for your prompt response to my emailed message to
you. I really appreciate your understanding and I consider it expedient to
give you the details of this transaction that will enable you understand
the reality of the transaction. This transaction is 100% legitimate in
essence that it will undergo normal procedures as stipulated in the banking
and allied matters act and all legal documents will be issued in your name
and favor.

I think you will agree with me that the world now is a business world and
that is why one required building a sustainable legacy for his or her
children and this is what I am doing. There are two categories of people in
the world today, one we have the poor people and the other we have the
rich. On the other hand, for one to be rich now depends on his / her
ability to make use of this kind of privilege in life, no matter where you
are. There is no profession that guarantees your wealth, so today there are
poor engineers, poor doctors, poor teachers, poor businessmen and women,
poor lawyers, even poorer than a rat, so your ability to capture such a
privilege matters a lot in life since there is no one left behind to claim
the deposited funds. That is why I contacted you because you share the same
last name with Mr. Simon, (blessed memory) so that you can lay claim to
this huge amount left behind as his next of kin and i will use my veto
power as his Lawyer when he was alive to establish you as his next of kin
since the bank mandated me to provide the next of kin for the claim. That
is why I contacted you in this great business opportunity since you share
the same last name with Mr. Simon. Bear in mind that no matter your country
of Origin, a next of kin could be anybody and could come from any country
irrespective of colour,rase, tribe,nationality, age and even language. I
hope you understand this?

I want to assure you that what I have brought before you is as clear as a
daylight which will never endanger your position in anyway. I am Ayi Komi
from the country of Republic Togo city Lome, it is located in the Western
part of Africa, a Certified Legal Practitioner and principal attorney
working in all areas of the family Court Jurisdiction.

I have been the personal attorney representing the Late Mr. Simon for many
years before he met his untimely death, Ever since then, I have done
everything possible to trace his relatives without any luck. Most of his
properties have been vandalized by hoodlums and some over grown by weeds as
there is no one to look after them.

You will be entitiled to 40% of the total fund at the conclusion of the
transaction, 10% will be used to finish Mr. Simon charity foundation
project, myself i will earn 45% of the fund for my services while 5% will
be maped out to take care of all expenses but note that this 10% can only
be taken out after the fund must have been remitted to you. I will come to
your country when the funds is released to you to meet you in person in
your country for the sharing/disbursement of the funds.

Late Mr. Simon, was born in 1944. He worked with a development company as
an Engineer and later retired to private practice as a consultant and
formed an oil sevicing company. He operated an account a bank here in Lome
Togo until his death.

Let me put to you that in Banking industries, chances or opportunities like
this are common but not heard. People put their monies in banks and some of
these accounts are either coded or confidentially operated, therefore, when
such people die what do you think that happens to these monies when nobody
comes for their claims? Well, this is one of the numerous avenues good
"free" monies are made within and amongst the officials of the banks. I was
privy with his transaction from the Bank so I will present a next of kin to
claim this fund. I will send you a copy my drafted application letter and
forward to you to fill in properly and submit to the bank, this will
automatically signal the commencement of the transaction as all other
procedures will be forwarded to you as well.

Please note that this transaction requires utmost trust, sincerity and
confidentiality for its conclusion. You can reach me on my telephone:
+22899274596/+2348109493071 and also send to me your private telephone
number to enhance our communication, its very important you get back to me
with this below information, i will use it to draft out an application
letter that we will use to contact the bank.
