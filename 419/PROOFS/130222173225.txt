Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thanks for your urgent reply.I am the lawyer to Engr Jao, he was  working
in LOME-TOGO as an engineer with a well-known oil company. (Shell Oil
Company) in Republic of Togo is located in West Africa.Engr Jao  was my
client, and I takes care of all his properties. He deposited the fund worth
14.3 Million united state dollars in one of the largest bank in LOME-TOGO
(BTCI BANK), when he was alive.

Unfortunately he died in a car accident. Since his death I tried to see if
I can find his relatives but all efforts to find them were unsuccessful.
Now the bank where the money was deposited called me to provide the next of
kin that will claim the fund, That was why I contacted you.  I tried
earlier to find his relatives but could not find them. I am very glad that
you responded to this letter, because if I am not able to provide the next
of kin to apply for the claim of the fund, the bank will confiscate the
fund and convert it into a security account, so it would be so painful that
I'll be here, and allows the bank to confiscate my client=92s fund just
because I am not able to provide someone to claim it.

Also, I want to assure you that this transaction is 100% free. Thus, you
need not fear anything. I am here to provide all necessary information and
documents, the bank may require as proof of the claim, the said bank does
not even know the real relatives so you are guaranteed, I advise you to
handle this transaction with maturity and keep the secret. All documents
related to this transaction will be purchased legally with the relevant
ministries. I look forward to your urgent reply so that I can send a
request of application Form, you must fill out and send back to me so that
I could submit it to the bank on your behalf. If I apply the bank will know
that I have found the next of kin. I hope you understand the procedure. You
can ask questions.
With best wishes

Thanks
Aziz Richard. (Esq
