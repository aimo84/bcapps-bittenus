*Hello My Beloved,
Alternatively: m.nbrickle@gmail.com<https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/h/15dbgmehv7e4p/?&v=b&cs=wh&to=m.nbrickle@gmail.com>

Thank you very much for replying my mail.

Please, I am willing this money to you with all my heart and I believe
it is the will of God for me to meet you today. Ever since I got this
strange illness of mine I strongly devoted my life to Jesus Christ and
I have decided to Will my money to someone that will do in accordance
to the Will of God in helping others and spreading the word of God to
people that the gospel have not reached. It is God's blessing to you.

All I want from you is prayers because this illness is getting worst
as I am seeing it, is too much on me now but keep on praying for me to
be in the right hand side of God almighty. However the doctor said to
me today that i may not be able to survive, please kindly put me in
prayers I would like to be sure of your willingness and
trustworthiness and commitment to execute this MISSION for the work of
God for me, I cannot afford to compromise these virtues. Considering
the money involved, it is necessary for me to be sure of the person to
whom I will be entrusting, my trust is not given out lightly, I need
to be convinced that you are a matured person with some integrity.

TRUST AND CONFIDENCE
I need to emphasis on the need for trust and confidence on both sides
as the pillar for the success there is noting for you to worry about.
You need to reassure me that you will not betray me and sit on this
fund when it finally comes into your custody or to be misused by
unbelievers .

Forward to me the followings:

1. Your full name.......2. Home and office address.....3. Occupation.....4.
Personal/private phone number.....5.Nationality..... 6. Age......

What I expect from you is trust and commitment; I don't want a
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.
I want to know if you are willing to follow up this seriously, before
I can give you more details about this MISSION; however I shall be
waiting your response and assurance. Again let me remind you that
being a part of this MISSION would only be at your free will, I cannot
impose this on you, it is your choice to agree or disagree, but at
least I deserve the privilege of knowing your decision.

I want you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my
shepherd.
Get back to me immediately with this information and hoping to hear from
you.

Best Regards,
Mrs.Brickle
