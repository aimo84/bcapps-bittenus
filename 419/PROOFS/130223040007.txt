Dearest=A0 Leonard Zeptowitz,

=0AI am glad to read your email. Right deep inside of me, I am always concerned=0Afor the needy, the poor, the disabled, the vets, injured animals, and have=0Aalways contributed in the past especially to the Red Cross during the disasters=0Ain Haiti, the Tsunami victims, Japan Earthquakes, as well as assisting=0Aorganizations for battered women, or displaced girls and women, In the Assembly=0Awe do have the welfare committee which we call the social responsibility=0Acommittee this committee is looking at the needs of the community around their=0Aneighborhood and even at the needy children at schools. We are from time to=0Atime ask from businessmen and women around for help in order for us to be able=0Ato help those in need, I am presently taken a special treatment in a Hospital=0ALondon, all I needed you to do is to help me use my fund to open a new=0Acharitable house organizations in your community to support the less privileged=0Apeople around and to Support Humanitarian, I cannot do this by myself anymore=0Adue to my present situation, I do not have the physical strength again.=0A

=0ALet me tell you more about my life. I was born an orphan in Lebanon in the=0A40's. When I was 18 years, I won a scholarship to study in England. Since then,=0AI have been living in the UK and have had a difficult past few lives. I worked=0Ahard as a secretary with a Gold smiting company earning huge amount of money=0Auntil my retirement in the 90's. I was privileged to travel to places, meet=0Apeople, had good times, though I was never married. Now I sit all alone not=0Aknowing what next is going to happen me due to my bad health condition. I'm=0Aconfident that I will not regret making this donation to you, not minding that=0AI am yet to meet you physically. I personally choose this way to reach out and=0Ahelp someone entirely unknown to me because I believe helping people has a=0Aripple effect. If you help someone today, they will feel more obliged to help=0Asomeone else, and so on.=0A

=0AMy happiness would be fulfilled if you will endeavor to put my donation into=0Aany charity or humanitarian cause to help less privileged people around you.=0AHumanitarian causes are a driving force in my mind, my heart and soul. I do not=0Ahave the physical strength to do all these anymore because of my deteriorating=0Ahealth and that is why I am choosing you. I believe that the best way to give=0Acharity is to allow your inner mind to lead you. That is exactly what I am=0Adoing now.=0A

=0APresently, my mind and emotions are filled with anxiety as my health keeps=0Agoing down gradually. I don't know what else to do than to take this bold=0Adecision to donate my entire savings to you. I would like to know more about=0Ayou before I can give reference about you my bank, meanwhile, i will give=0Aauthorize letter to my bank for release of the donations fund. Please make sure=0Ayou use the fund for Supporting Humanitarian and charitable organizations.=0A
