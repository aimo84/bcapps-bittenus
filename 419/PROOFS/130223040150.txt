*Dear.Friend,
      Thanks for your mail which I just received with the contents well
understood. I want to assure you that there is no risk in this transaction,
the reason why I contacted you in this transaction is because our late
customer Mr. Andreas Schranner is  a foreigner and an indigence of (Burkina
be) cannot stand as next of kin to our deceased customer unless a
foreigner. But for now I want you to be following up every process that I
will be giving you so that we can achieve this aim.

I want you to assure me of your capability of handling this transfer with
trust by giving me the following information's about yourself:
1) Your age.
2) Your occupation.
3)Your private telephone number.
4) Your location and your full contact address

Base on this I will advise you to feel free all is well; I studied this
transaction very well before contacting you for assistance. Well, having
served this bank for so many years now and nearing my retirement I deem it
necessary to utilize this opportunity of the present unclaimed sum of money
in the account sent inconjuction with the first proposal I sent to you to
help myself and my family's after my retirement through the investment I
will establish in your country with my percentage in the transaction.

There is no doubt about your eligibility as the legal next of kin to our
deceased customer and owner of the account number BOA-1036-086, with the
following reasons: (a) Before the death of our deceased customer his true
next of kin was not indicated to the board of directors of the bank because
of the top secrecy and confidentiality of the transactions which our late
customer transacted with the various governments in West Africa. (b Owning
to his failure to indicate his next of kin to the officials of the bank, it
is therefore impossible for the board of directors of the bank to verify
the next of kin as well as the true heritor of the fund.

(c)And for the above reasons the managements of the bank authorized me
officially as the executive manager, AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT of
the bank to verify the next of kin to our deceased customer. Therefore, the
bank will always abide by my official directions through the official
authorization bestowed on me. And for this reasons you have nothing to fear
as your interest and identity will be legally protected. More so, the only
information=92s required from you by the bank is your banking data as
contained in the official application which I will give you  to send to our
bank after your immediate response because the receipt of your application
is the of the official process of this transaction.

Now I will like to use this opportunity to tell you the detail
information's concerning our deceased customer. The deceased account holder
with our bank was MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER, A CITIZEN OF GERMAN who
naturalized here in Burkina Faso for (16) years. He held account number
BOA-1036-086,  with our bank. He died in Kenya air ways that crashed at
Abidjan with his family as I stated in my first mail. Since his death, this
account has been dormant and nobody has applied to our bank for the release
of this money to him or her as the next of kin.

As the auditing and accounting Manager of this bank, I have studied this
transaction very carefully and I have noted that there are no risks
involved. I am here to protect all your interests in this transaction until
this money hits your account. Since I am here I shall be giving you all the
developmental information from the bank as soon as this transaction
commences. I know that you will not disappoint me when this money enters
your account; I have all my hope in this transaction because I shall soon
go on retirement.

 I am a simple banker whose credibility is still intact and with my
maturity and understanding, I promise to give you the best co-operation.
We must hurry up with this transaction so that our bank and the government
shall not claim and inherit this money because it has over-stayed. After
the bank have approve your application as next of kin to our late customer
I will fly down your country for investment with my own share, but I will
advise you to keep it as a top secret because nobody again new about this
transaction except you and I.
Call me. +22665290254
Waiting to hear from you urgently,
Best Regards,
Mr.Azzia Mohammad.*
