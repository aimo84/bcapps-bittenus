Sir, The most important reason why i choose to contact you is for you
to kindly take the below responsibilities to save me and my
inheritance.

1. To stand as my Foreign Trustee over the transaction and other
inheritance claim.
2. You are responsible to provide any bank account for the transaction
(either empty bank a/c or operational current a/c.)
3. After the transaction has been fully completed, you are obliged to
assist me re-locate to your country.

First of all, I will like to tell you that this is not such
transaction from internet, you will only contact the bank and request
them to transfer my money to your account, my situation is very
critical.

For your information this is my dream do not play with it, I have hand
it over to you for you to fulfill it. Try and get this money from the
bank of Africa and use it to build an orphanage home in your country,
i hope you are a GOD fearing person? And do not inform any one about
it, let GOD be praise not man you will succeed if you keep it within
your self as a secret before the fund enters your account, take my
words and let GOD be with you.

Well i may not live to see the day that will come tomorrow, but GOD
knows every thing.

Please i want you to do all in your power to make sure that you
received this money from the (Bank Of Africa) and do as i have told
you to help my soul rest with GOD.

You are to contact the bank so that the bank will transfer the money
to you as i have instructed them that any body, who came in receipt of
the fund and provide the necessary information about me, should be the
person that they will transfer the fund to.

I pray to GOD to give you the strength to proceed, please i beg you in
the name of God, do not be discourage, no matter  what,  i will always
be with you in spirit before you accomplish my dreams, note that you
are  my hope of making the chance to be with GOD.

Finally send a mail to the bank and let them know the following
procedure, regarding all i have instructed you to do with my money; i
may not live to read your email again because my condition is getting
worst. Do this to help my soul rest with GOD.

I wish you the best in life and success, and may the GOD be with you
in any thing you do and any were you  go, please do this alone don't
tell any one about this, only GOD know how to reward me.
