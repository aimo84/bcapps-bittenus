Dear  Friend,

Greetings!

Thanks for your urgent reply to my business proposal. I am working in
African Development Bank where the said funds emanated. There is no
risk involved in this business because I will monitor every step the
bank takes to actualize this fund for us. It will take about 14 bank
working days to be concluded.

I contacted you because I needed a person who has an off-shore account
so that the person can stand as the next of kin/business partner to
the deceased, we can team up and receive the money in his account for
us to share. I believed that you can handle it hence, i contacted you.

 The deceased died along with his wife who supposed be the next of kin
and business partner with their two children. Based on the information
he tended and recorded in our computer Departments, our investigations
proved that no trace of his relative since it was not recorded in the
form he filled while depositing the funds. No other person was aware
of this deposited. His intention was to expand his business to
otherAfrica Countries.

 The bank will be communicating with you on mail and you have to
forward every mail from the bank to me to enable me advice you on what
to reply to the bank until the money is transferred to your bank
account. After which, I will travel to your country to meet you for
the sharing of the fund.

 I believe you will give me my share when you receive the money in
your bank  account. This is my hope of becoming a successful banker
like my predecessors. Please, do not disappoint me. You will get 40%
of the total amount usd$18.5 million,10% will be for expenses you and
i will in cure in the course of claiming this fund to your bank
account while the balance of 50% will be for me.

I am waiting for your urgent answer so that i can forward the text of
application to you to fill and send to the bank to start the process.
Remember, all the documents to be used in claiming this fund to your
bank account will be legally secured from the Ministry of justice. I
will be happy if you will give in your best to assist me.

Best wishes,
Uba Ahmed.
