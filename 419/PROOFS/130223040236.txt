Dear Leonard=2C

Good morning to you from Japan.

Thank you for your response to my mail as well as your willingness to work with me on this project . I hope my message meet you and your family in good health. Please find details of our intended project.

The uniqueness of your last name has made it possible for us to come together and carry out this pending business transaction=2C while we anticipate on sharing some reasonable profit. In everything one does with another there must be a meeting of minds. Without us both seeing and assessing the situation through the same lenses there cannot and will never be success or progress.
=20
Once again=2C I thank you so much for your response. I request that you go through the details below for a better understanding of this possible joint venture. My message to you was written as a matter of last resort because of the circumstances surrounding this claim. Mr.Jonah Zeptowitz was an oil merchant and he had oil dealings around Europe and Asia. He died in 2006 at 63=2C along side his wife=2C Gabriele=2C49 and their only daughter=2CKalai =2C 12.
=20
I am not too sure you are actually related to this person because we have since carried out a search on his actual extended family ties and which efforts have been to no avail and hence my contacting you. To find the relatives of my late customer=2C private investigators were employed by my bank Sendai Bank Japan and Fujian Haixia Bank but with no success. I have the opportunity of looking into the report of the private investigators and with my personal research I was able to contact you. My further research brought up your name and two others.I have not yet contacted them. I had contacted you first to solicit your honest assistance in re-profiling funds belonging to my late customer. I want you to consider the details so you could understand the fuller reasons I need your co-operation.

Mr.Jonah Zeptowitz lived most of his years here in Japan. I served as his private banker for the last nine years preceding his death and I had known the family a little while before then. I contacted you because after the death of my late customer=2C I was informed by the Bank to search for any member of his extended family=2C to put up a claim=2C or who could be so represented as managers or trustees for his deposited funds with them which stands at over GBP14=2C400=2C000.00) Fourteen Million=2C Four Hundred Thousand Great British Pounds=2C due to the fact that he died with his immediate family members.
=20
After preliminary efforts of search which came to no avail=2C we were given an ultimatum to look for someone to come for the claim or have the funds liquidated and made unserviceable in accordance with existing laws because it will be assumed that no member of his family is alive. However=2C it might interest you to know that=2C after a thorough investigation in the Bank=2C I found out that some members of the company are currently planning to divert this fund in their selfish interest and only want to use the excuse that since I am not able to look for someone to make the claim=2C the money should be made unserviceable and that means reverting the fund to the Government while the company retains a percentage of it.

At this stage I have exclusive access to the files of Late Mr.Jonah .My immediate plan after getting more information from you is to first quietly put in a claim for you with Fujian Haixia Bank for verification and immediate action. Thereafter I will instruct a solicitor whom I have initially contacted to prepare all the documents in your name i.e. Affidavit of testament of WILL=2C including probate letters stating you as legal beneficiary as well as next of kin and sole executor to my late customer estate (which includes cash). Based on my ground work=2C the funds transfer to you will be approved and then authorization given to the Fujian Haixia Bank to make payment to you. Please this is very important and your total commitment is what is desired and most communication will be done via this email address for extreme confidential reasons.

You must understand why there must be serious confidentiality about this whole process.Fujian Haixia Bank is a specialist bank=2C which deals with high net worth individuals and giant corporations. I have my contact there to make sure that nothing goes wrong. As soon as the  bank has gone through all formalities with verification of document I put in file=2C Fujian Haixia Bank will make payments to you. This will be done as certain verifications required by law have to be done but be sure all have covered. Furthermore=2C my experience in banking will lead me into guiding you on the route the funds will take before finally getting to your account. It is very important that there is a proxy bank in which the funds will first be paid before getting to you. All this will be done in a properly ordered manner so as to be able to properly and securely beat the system when it comes to large international money transfers. We are going to take this matter on a step-by-step basis. However something that I must point out to you at this stage is that there is no wrong on your part. The only person who could have disputed this is long gone.

For success in a partnership there must be a meeting of minds. I need you to follow and adhere to my every instruction and do exactly as I will advice for success to be gained. You must let me direct this project step by step  to ensure the success. This is not negotiable my friend as we go into partnership.I will imagine that if all go as planned the whole process should take about 10-14 working days before money will be in your account. Please this is very important and your total commitment is what is desired.

Dear friend=2C please let us be positive and show discretion as we both make one of the most fruitful steps of our lives. My spoken English is I guess not too bad but whatever information is not clear on the telephone will be clarified by email. I wait your response as we commence this business together ! Finally the issue of keeping our mouth shut in a sensitive business like this is important. Our discussion of this business with friends and families is the only way we can put our success under a great risk. I strongly recommend this information be kept to you and you only. I am an old man looking to a fruitful retirement. This little way of helping ourselves will not do us much bad. Once again I appreciate your willingness and I will be waiting for your response=2Cso I can furnish you with more details on how we intend to execute this project.

I will appreciate you send me your direct phone number so we can exchange voice contact.

I wish you and your family  a nice day.

Yours faithfully=2C
Isao Misoono.
