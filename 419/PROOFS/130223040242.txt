Dear Friend,

Thanks for your mail. As I told you earlier I discovered this fund
during our bank routine audit check. I found out that if I don't find
a way to transfer the fund to a foreign account the fund will be
forfeited to the government as unclaimed fund.

Meanwhile, this fund belongs to our Muslim brother, his name is: MR HAMID AMINE
RAZZAQ, he is a Lebanon, a physician and industrialist. He met his
sudden death in plane crash on the 26Th of December 2003 in BENIN
REPUBLIC.  The doomed flight UTA 141 originated in Conakry, Guinea and
picked up passengers in Freetown, Sierra Leone and Cotonou before
heading on its way to Beirut before the airline crashed into the sea
off the West African nation of Benin, killing at least 111 people.

When my bank hear of his death, the bank board of directors set up a
three (3)men fact finding committee to investigate and find out the
related information=92s about his family. I was made a member of the
committee and at the end of our assignment we collected information
which included that he died along with his wife and his only son who
was suppose to be his next of kin according to his file and he did not
name any other person as his beneficiary, since then the bank had been
waiting to see whether any of his relatives could come forward and put
claims over his balance fund with our bank but none showed up.

The edict establishing this bank states that any such fund (abandoned)
that is not claimed within five years will be forfeited to the
government as unclaimed fund, unfortunately, Some of the bank
authority are planning to share this fund among themselves as nobody
is coming up for the claims. My plan is for you to come over as the
next of kin to the deceased man to put a claim over the fund, all
arrangement to make this deal work out successfully have been put in
place. I promise you a 100% risk free with my position in this bank.

Please let me know immediately you receive this mail if it will be
possible for you to come over to my country or not so that I will tell
you what to do next. This is my private phone number, you can reach me
any time: +226 78228311

Waiting to hear from you soon,

Yours Faithfully
Mr. Ahmed Hassan
