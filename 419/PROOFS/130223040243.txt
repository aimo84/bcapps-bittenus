Dear sir/madam

I kindly want to put these pieces of information to your notice. My
name Is George Raymond  a citizen of South Africa, formerly based in
London but  I am presently in India seeking for a reliable and trust
worthy fellow to assist me in investing my money  which  I deposited
with  the United Nation=92s office Banking Department here in India  for
an investment Purpose.

The said amount is SeventeenM illion five hundred US dollar ($17.5
Million). I am seeking investment in Asia Countinent because Asia has
the fastest growing economy in the world which prompted the US
president to visit Asia to seek access to the market.

If you would be my partner please get back to me (ray102g@gmail.com )
as I was strictly informed that a foreigner cannot operate a bank
account that will accomodate such an amount and that direct foreigner
investment is not allowed in Asia except on a joint venture. So I want
you as a citizen of Asia to assist me so that we can transfer this
fund into your nominated Local bank account.I am offering 20% of the
total sum, if really you are capable of handling this transaction
correctly and the balance 80% will be properly secured by you until we
find a lucrative business to invest this cash.I will travel from here
to meet with you in your country after you receive the funds for
proper introduction and further bussiness discussion details to be
discussed one on one.

I will give you more details as soon as I receive a copy of your
passport, your private cell phone number and your present location and
your banking details where the funds will be transferred to.Please we
have to keep a low profile to this transaction to enable us to deal
with this transaction very urgently.

I am eagerly waiting for your favourable reply.

Regards,

George Raymond
