 Honestly=2CI appreciate your interest in this transaction=2C but I would say that your interest to assist me was rather unspecific following the brief sentences which was contained in your email=2Cas a result of which I am quite skeptical in believing that you could be of assistance to me as a partner however=2C I would like to be sure of your willingness=2C trustworthiness and commitment to execute this transaction with me=2CI cannot afford to compromise these virtues.Presently=2C I am employed to this bank=2C from where I plan to   finalize the execution of this transfer before I'll resign=2C with my position in this bank=2C I am promising you that if you can follow my instructions in this transaction=2C i am capable of completing this transaction within the period of 14 bank working days starting from the day you apply to the bank as the next of kin to the deceased customer and base on your maximum co-operation and assistance.
