*Dear Friend,**

*
* Thank you for considering my proposal. Let me formally introduce myself
to you. I am DR BRUCE VAN SAUN, Executive Director and Group Finance
Director of ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND GROUP PLC*
*I contacted you concerning an abandoned sum of nine million,eight hundred
thousand pounds (9,800,000.00 GBP). In June 2002, A customer called MR
RAMESH UTTAM NAGAR from INDIA came to our bank for business discussions and
investment, As the officer in charge of his transaction, I encouraged him
to consider various growth of funds with prime ratings. Then he invested
Six Million Five Hundred Thousand Pounds only. Based on my advice, we were
able to spin the initial deposit with profit and interest to 9.8 million
pounds.*

*After few months; my bank (ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND GROUP PLC) sent several
notice to him. Again another notification was sent but still no response
came from him. After series of investigation, I got information that MR
RAMESH UTTAM NAGAR and his family died in a plane crash when they where
going on vacation to near by country from ENGLAND.*
* Because of the sensitive nature of private Banking, most Customers Do not
nominate next of Kin in their Investment, also usually in most cases leave
their wills in our Care, in this case; our now deceased died in-testate
Client.
  It is quite clear now that our dear client died with no known or
identifiable family member. According to practice, the Private Banking
sector will by the end of this year broadcast a request for statement of
claim to ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND GROUP PLC, failing to receive viable claims
they will probably revert the deposit to the Management of ROYAL BANK OF
SCOTLAND GROUP PLC. This will result the money entering the ROYAL BANK OF
SCOTLAND GROUP PLC accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my
hands and out of the private Banking division. *
* Now what bothers me most is that according to the laws of My Country at
the expiration of Ten {10} years the funds will revert to the ownership of
the UNITED KINGDOM Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Now, I
am prepared to give the necessary details to you as the closest surviving
relation of our deceased customer,to stand as next of kin of MR RAMESH
UTTAM NAGAR. I am also proposing that after a successful execution of the
business deal, the funds will be shared in the ratio 40/60. You will get
40% and I will be entitled to 60% as the initiator of the deal. You know
that I must have done my home work already before contacting you. Although
the project is capital intensive, I know I will be able to pull it through
following proper Banking and legal channels with your assistance at your
end. I will tidy up the legal aspect with the assistance of a lawyer who
will prepare all the documents that will be needed to transfer the money
from UNITED KINGDOM to your country. Once more, I ask that if you find no
interest in this project that you should discard this mail and forget I
ever contacted you, I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive; do
not destroy my career.*

* Opportunities like this only come once in a lifetime. I am a family man
and this is an opportunity for me to give my family the best in life. I
would want you to think about this and let me know your decision. If you
give me positive response, I will give you the relevant INFORMATION for the
successful transfer of these funds and we both enjoy it in peace.*

*I await your response. Regards,  DR BRUCE VAN SAUN
