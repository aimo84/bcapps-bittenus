Dear Friend,
I am most grateful for your response and compassion. I want to believe that
you are a God fearing person, for you to respond to my mail and by the
Grace of God we are going to succeed in this project because it is 100%
legal and risk free as this funds were legally acquired by me and this
project is to save the souls of the dying ones,which is Godly.
Due to my ill health I may not be responding to your emails a lot quicker I
know it looks quite weird for me to have contacted you with such a proposal
of this magnitude but my very good friend I consider it as one of the risks
I have to take on earth and I want you to do me a favour by giving me a
benefit of doubt and your assurance that you will not let me down and I
assure you that your participation in this project will never be a regret
to you. I have considered the only last good deed I can do on earth before
I finally pass on to meet our heavenly father so I want to to please take
this project very serious.
When I heard from the doctor that my condition has become so bad, I had to
reach out for a trustworthy and fearing individual that will utilize this
money the way I am going to instruct. as I am currently undergoing going
medical treatment. I want you to claim this funds from the bank, I'll
instruct the attorney to prepare a letter of authority in your favour to
the Bank and send you the certificate deposit/ slip and also instruct him
to give you the necessary details of how to go about this mission. I have
decided to complete this mission for God before my death hence i know where
i am going. What made it difficult and worrisome is that my family are not
God fearing hence I can not entrust such money into their hands as I want
it to be used to bless the children of God all around the world.
Thanks for your mail, your mail has relieved me and I pray to Almighty God
with his infinite mercy to reward you.
Reply with the following info to enable me prepare the document in your
name.

I will be expecting to hear from you as soon as you receive this e mail.
Please continue to remember me in your prayers.
Yours Truly,
Williams Simon
