Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thank you very much for your readiness and zeal to assist me over my poor condition, again sorry for my late response is because I do not have internet access besides I now stay on the Missionary camp-Gezo here in Cotonou Republic of Benin (French Speaking Country). I am Osa John 26 years single girl, from Sierra Leone.

Sir, actually the money is US$5.7million which my late father deposited with the Central Bank Of West African States (BCEAO) with my names as te next of kin and he WILLED it to me. and since then I have been trying to retrieve the fund but the Bank will not listen to me, according to the governing laws of the Country that anybody under Refugee or Missionary Camp Gezo are not allowed to be involved in any monetary transaction hence I was denied the access to retrieve the fund of my late Father.

I was further advice by the legal department of the Bank to seek for the assistance of a foreigner who will look after me and stand to claim the fund through my support as the next of kin to the fund as deposited by my late father.Sir, I will be glade if you can honestly assist me with your heart without having any doubtful thought minds because I really wish to continue with my educational career once the fund is in your possession. More so, I will like to invest part of the fund into and lucrative business under your care.

Once i have know you better, i will send to you the full contact address of the bank where the funds are deposited so that you can contact the bank and find out the possibilities of transferring the funds to your bank account as my foreign partner. Note that after you have receive the funds in your bank account, you will then have to withdraw some amount of money to send to me down here to aneble me get my International Passport and Air Ticket to come over to join with you in your country.
