Dear Beloved,

I am most grateful for your mail, and I seize this opportunity to thank
you for coming to my rescue and to also let you know that this
transaction is a straight forward and legal transaction.

I am somebody with a conscience. If this transaction was in any way
illegal, I would tell you straight away so that you know what is
involved and decide for yourself.But it is not like that at all, and
you will later see and understand that a huge amount of money 
is involved in this transaction.
I hope you were not too embarrassed by my first email to you since you
do not know me. I had no option since my immediate and extended family
in and outside Dubai refused to distribute my funds because they want
to keep it to themselves.

I didn't know how to move the funds out and dispatched it to charity
organizations,so I resulted to putting fate to test and making a random
contact. I got your email address from the web email directory and
decided to introduce myself to you.

I am communicating with only you at this moment with regards to this
transaction. And I would not have any cause to do otherwise, except you
state your intention to withdraw your assistance. Just like I stated in
my first mail to you, this fund is presently in a finance/Security Company
abroad,I cannot claim these funds myself as a result of,

(1) I am under going medical treatment. It has defiled all forms of
medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live,
according to medical experts.

(2) I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have
decided to give alms to charity organizations and other groups of
people that need alms. as I want this to be one of the last good deeds
I do on earth It is for this reasons I am seeking for your assistance
to stand as the beneficiary to the fund and retrieve it on my behalf
and dispatched it to charity organizations.

All the necessary documents required to get the Funds out of the 
security firm are in the possession of my attorney and he will be
sending them to you after we must have come to a conclusion and reached
an agreement. Not before.

I need you to give me your words that you will be very honest and
straight forward with me when the money gets to you, So long as you can
execute this transaction successfully and help me dispatched it to
charity organizations.

Thus, I would need you to get back to me on the following issues,

(1) That you are in a position to be trusted as a God fearing person
with such a large amount of fund and dispatched it to charity
organization.

(2) That you ready to sign a letter of guarantee with my lawyer on
behalf of me due to my health problem, clearly stating the terms of
this transaction, including your percentages and dispatching the
remaining funds to charity organizations and others, as my lawyer will
be a living witness that you fulfill your promise of dispatching my
funds to charity organizations so that I am assured that the money would
be safe in your hands even when am at the gate.

(3) That you are willing to contact the finance/Security Company abroad,
to discuss the terms of releasing the funds($21,000,000.00).

You fully understand this transaction up to this stage and you are
ready to proceed under these terms.

As soon as I receive your reply that you are ready to proceed under
these terms, then I will furnish you with all details of my lawyer?
details for the secure of the release of my funds and disposure to the
charities,But if you have any questions up to this stage, please ask
and I will be more than happy to respond to them.

And all the necessary documentations to conclude this transaction and the
finance/Security Company abroad,details will be given to you by my lawyer.
Thanks for your mail, your mail has relieved me and I pray to almighty
God in his infinite mercy to reward you.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it now.

I want you to pray for me so that God would forgive me and be merciful
to me and accept my soul.

May God bless you
Alhaji Ahmed Hassan.
