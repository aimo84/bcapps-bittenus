Dear Leornard=2C

   I am glad to have your interest concerning my mail to you.Because i have been waiting to have that.Despite you had failed to provide me with your Bank account details to proceed with the fund transfer ASAP.
  Based on your request.I still want you to review and read again my first mail to you .This is the exact place i had already detailed you all the key point in this my life story.Anyway i will not hesitate to throw more light=2Cclarify further in a simplified form for your comprehensive understanding.
  I am an AIDS virus carrier/patient.I am bold to tell you this because it is quite vivid that my chance of survival is at risk or zero.Since my body immune systems has been damaged by this deadly virus.The doctor has predicted my ephemeral days of living in this world.That i may give up ghost any moment.
  Because of this reason.I want to hand over the parental responsibility left on my only son=2CWilson unto your care henceforth.Since i can no longer live to accomplish this parental task to him as his lovely mother.I urgently need your permit to hand over to you the remaining sum of 5.8million pounds i had in a fixed deposit account into your immense care.As well as all the welfare concerning the upbringing of my son =2CWilson.I had earlier set aside this fund for the betterment of my son.
  I want you to invest the total sum of 85% of the whole money gradually in nurturing his abundant talents=2Ctrain and raise him up to a reasonable manhood age.While the little sum of 15% goes to your humble self as a reward of acceptance to carryout this task on my behalf.
  Kindly go ahead and provide me with your personal bank account details as requested.Hoping you will accomplish this task with the absolute sincerity in you=2Cwithout any betrayal as soon as this money is released to you in the offing.Once again=2Cbear in mind that this money is my last hope for the poor boy.I don't want him to live and suffer in penury in the nearest future.
  Always carry in mind that he is absolutely innocent.I plead you once again to keep this my life story/fund transfer as a top secret because of two important reasons below.

(i)I don't want anything that will dent the good image of my lovely son in the future.As regards to my disease=2Cbecause he is absolutely negative to my virus.I contacted this disease=2Ca year after i gave birth to him.After then =2Chis father died too.
