Hello My dear brother/partner Mr.Leonard Zeptowitz,
I am very happy that you responded to my proposal.I want to assure you once more that this transaction will be 100% risk free because all the documents will be secured from the United Kingdom law court and probate registry which will enable you to claim the money as the next of kin and beneficiary to late Richard Rowdall without any problem,i choose you because i needed someone who can handle this matter for me with all sincerity ,i will never ever do anything that will be at the detriment of your policy and your life,this is a pure transaction attached a copy of late Richards Death certificate which i secured when i traveled to Britain and heard of his death.Nothing will ever stop us from transferring the money unless if a dead man will rise up from death which you and i know that it will not be possible.The process of the transfer will follow itÂ´s normal legal process so that when the money will
be transferred, no one will ask any questions as to the origin of the money because the documents will explain everything.I will still need to have a copy of any of your identity so that i will know who i am dealing with and i will also use it to submit for the documents which i will secure on your behalf which are as follows:

 (1) Affidavit of facts which will state that the dead account holder (Late Mr.Richard Rowdall is dead and has no known next of kin;then the affidavit will confirm you as his next of kin.

(2)letter of administration, since there is no will stating that as the deceased account holder is dead and did not write any will and since you are the only known surviving relation as the affidavit will show, then his estate should be transferred to you and;

(3)There should be a certificate (Certificate of inheritance) that will be secured from the probate registry empowering you to the status of beneficiary of the deceased.

After securing all the above mentioned documents, you will not have any query from anyone regarding the transfer when it will be done because all the documents will be pointing at you as the sole beneficiary and next of kin to late Richard's account,you will not and will never have any problem.Once all the documents are secured in your name, i will simply take them to the bank here and apply for the transfer of the money to you as the next of kin,then i will give them your information so that they will contact you for the transfer
But Before we commence, I will like you to send me a copy of any form your identification;
(Driver's license or International passport)
Full name,
Home address,
Occupation and your position in the office
And your mobile telephone number.

I will also send you a copy of my international passport so that you will know who you are dealing with.
I want to be sure that I am transacting with the correct person. As soon as I get these from you, I will commence the paper work and also forward it to the bank for the transfer.You will get 40% for your assistance,then i will part with 60% which you will help me to invest in your line of business in your country as i do not know anything about investment. However, we will see as the processing of the transaction progresses. we should be having a daily communication so that you should be monitoring the daily progress of the deal for you to know when the money will be credited in your account.

All documentation shall be legally effective that no question will arise, as the source of the fund shall be covered with the documents.
I expect your immediate response.
Barr Roy Grimwood
