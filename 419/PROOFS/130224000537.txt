Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

Good day to =0Ayou and your family, hope all is well with you. I received your mail =0Awith good faith.I would like to say sorry for the late reply to your =0Aemail as that was due to the fact that i traveled out of the state for =0Aan official duty and just resumed work today.

To=0A=0A be honest with you! I am very glad to read from you concerning this =0Acritical matter. I want to explain this matter the way you would =0Aunderstand it clearly. All I am asking you is your sincere and honest =0Acooperation to ensure that we secure this fund safely into your custody =0Afor our mutual benefit. I hope that you will be honest and trustworthy =0Athat when these funds get across to your custody, you will not =0Adisappoint me and go away with all the money.Also i will be willing to =0Ainvest part of the money in the business you have proposed because i see=0A a great future in it but first we most work together to execute this =0Atransfer of funds into your account for our mutual benefits where you =0Astand to have 40% of the total sum transferred into your account.

Before we proceed =0Afurther, I can still tender your information to the bank as the =0Abeneficiary of the said amount of money, to ensure that this fund is =0Asuccessfully secured from the bank into your designated bank account. If=0A you=0A cannot use your existing account to secure these funds, I would advice =0Ayou to quickly open a new account for this urgent transfer.

I=0A have worked out the modalities of this transaction! I will give you all=0A the necessary information and guidelines, which the bank may require to=0A ensure that there is no further delay of this fund into your account. =0AAll that the bank needs is conviction with documentation with proof from=0A me that you are the beneficiary of the funds.

I would want =0Ayou to be rest assured that you are dealing with a mature mind. Do not =0Abe afraid in anyway. With me here, there is no risk. More so let not =0Ayour heart trouble you or your conscience prick you because of the =0Anature of the business. I cannot allow the bank to seize this huge sum =0Aof money.

=A0

Best regards,
Mark Murray.
