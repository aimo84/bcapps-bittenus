Dear Friend.=0A=0AAn Iraqi Engineer named Mr. Thahi Hammud, made a numbered fixed deposit of $16,000.000.00 million USD ( Sixteen Million United States Dollars) only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war, Seven years ago (2006). Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that Mr. Thahi Hammud and his family had been killed during the war in Gunfire that hit their home at Central Baghdad where his personal oil-well was.=0A=0AAfter further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Thahi Hammud did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Sixteen Million United States Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it.
