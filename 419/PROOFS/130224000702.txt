*CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBN).
HEAD OFFICE - ABUJA Office Address: Zaria street. Abuja.
Postal Address: P.M.B 0187, Garki Abuja.
Our Ref: CBN/OHG/FGN/2013
Your Ref:

PAYMENT FILE: CBN/BEN/2013.

My name is Dr.Kingsley C.Moghalu,the deputy governor CBN.I was mandated by
the President Federal Republic in conjunction with the Federal Executive
Council (FEC), the Senate Committee on Foreign Debts Reconciliation and
Implementation Panel on Contract/inheritance/compensation funds to complete
all the unpaid Contract/inheritance/lottery fund. You are required as a
matter of urgency to reconfirm your information including your name, phone
number and your address for verification and immediate payment within 24
hours.

To this effect, the sum of TEN MILLION, SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED
STATES DOLLARS (US$10.7m) has been approved for you. I wish to inform you
that all matters relating to the release of this payment is now under my
control and supervision. This development has become necessary due to the
activities of unpatriotic government/CBN  officials and impostors who keep
on frustrating every effort to settle our clients by making requests for
unauthorized fees and levies from them.

We apologize for any delay you might have encountered in the past; your
payment is now 100% Guaranteed

Kindly choose from these three modes of payment(wire transfer, diplomatic
cash payment and ATM card).

Best Regards,
Dr.Kingsley Moghalu
Deputy Governor CBN
