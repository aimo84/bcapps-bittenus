Dear Friend
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0I received your mail with thanks and with due =0Arespect, and without further ado I hereby state it clearly and more =0Aprecisely to you once again that=C2=A0 this proposal has nothing to do with =0Athe so called doubt or fear This is a clear and factual matter with all =0Athe valid documents intact with me
=0A=0A=0A
=0A=0A=0ATruly I will be very much glad=0A to share this transaction with you; please do understand that you and I=0A myself are to work as one team to inherit this fund, hence I am your =0Ainsider in the bank as the transaction commence. I advise you to feel =0Afree with me for all is going to be well with us.
=0A=0A=0A
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0I have never =0Acontacted any other person in this transaction except you.The deceased =0Aaccount holder with our bank is Mr. Christain Eich; He holds account =0Anumber BIB4934109 with our bank. He died on July 31 year 2000 with his =0Afamily.=0A Since his death, this account has been dormant and nobody has applied =0Ato our bank for the release of this money to him or her as the next of =0Akin.
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0I want you to arrange for a good receiving bank account =0Ainto which our bank=C2=A0 shall transfer this money in your favor as next of =0Akin and you have nothing=C2=A0 to fear since I am here, I shall be giving you=0A all the developmental=C2=A0 information's from the bank as soon as the =0Atransaction commence.
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0
=0A=0A=0APlease this is a business that requires =0A100% absolute secret, it is a=C2=A0 business that you don=E2=80=99t allow your right =0Ahand to know what your left hand is=C2=A0 doing, On the issue of your country=0A laws be assured that as soon as the bank=C2=A0 is effecting the transfer =0Athey will be sending a covering letter to your=C2=A0 home bank as a prove of =0Athe source of funds so we would not have any problem=C2=A0 with that. There =0Ais no doubt about your eligibility as the legal next of=0A kin=C2=A0 to our deceased customer and owner of the account number number =0ABIB4934109 with=C2=A0 the following reasons:
=0A=0A=0A
=0A=0A=0A(1.) Before the death of =0Aour deceased customer, His true next of kin was not indicated to the =0Aboard of directors of the bank because of the top secrecy and =0Aconfidentiality of the business which our late customer transacted with =0Athe various governments in West Africa.
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0(2.)Owning to his failure to=0A indicate his next of kin to the officials of=C2=A0 the bank, it is therefore=0A impossible for the board of directors of the bank=C2=A0 to verify the next =0Aof kin .
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0(3.) The deceased late Mr. Christain Eich did not have any =0Arelation with our bank; He was only a customer to our bank. So there is =0Ano trace either now or in future.
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0(4.)And for the above reasons, the=0A managements of the bank authorized, me=C2=A0 officially as the officer in =0Acharge of auditing and account section of the=C2=A0 bank to verify the next =0Aof kin=0A to our deceased customer.
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0
=0A=0A=0ATherefore, the bank will always abide=0A by my official directions through the official authorization bestowed =0Aon me. And for this reasons you have nothing to fear as your interest =0Aand identity will be legally protected.
=0A=0A=0A
=0A=0A=0A=C2=A0Remember that 30% of =0Athis fund has being declared for you, for your assistance in providing =0Aan account where this fund will be transferred into and for all your =0Aeffort, and all other incurring expenses in course of transferring of =0Athis fund into your account.10% has been mapped out for expenses that =0Amay be incurred on the process of transferring this fund into your =0Aaccount.While the balance will be for me.
