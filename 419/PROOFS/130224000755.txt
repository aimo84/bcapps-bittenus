Thanks for your email, my sister and i came from Sudan, our dad was 
killed during the war in our country and before his death he made us to 
understand that he deposited some money in Ghana with a security company
 and while the war was going on we had the opportunity to escape the war
 to Ghana where the fund was deposited and with the documents we have to
 prove the ownership of the fund and as the beneficiary we have been 
able to locate the security company and we have been assured by the 
company that the fund will be released to us once our trustee 
beneficiary is ready to receive the fund as was stipulated in the 
official fund document by our late father. We are only asking that you 
be our trustee beneficiary to produce an account to
 receive the fund on our behalf and assist us with the investment of the
 fund
 in your country as we will be relocating immediately the fund is 
transferred to your account.

Alternatively, you may come to meet 
with us in Ghana to see things for yourself and meet with the security 
company to find out what is required to get the fund across to you, we 
will be very happy if you can assist us in this areas and we are willing
 to give you the percentage as stated in our earlier email to you, 
please send us your reachable telephone number as we are expecting to 
hear from you soon to proceed.

Thank you,
Amed/ Amina Momodu.
