So I am compelled to contact you because of the maltreatment I am receiving from my step mother. He's going to take away all my late father's treasury and properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father.
=A0
In the meantime I wanted to escape from Africa to any where in the world but she hide my international passport and other valuable travel documents. Luckily she did not discover where I kept my father's File which contains important documents. So I decided to run to the refugee camp where I am presently seeking asylum under the Private charity organization for the Refugee here in Republic of Senegal. I would like to contact you personally for a long term relationship that can lead us to something better if it works well. I give you the phone number of the Rev pastor in charge of this camp, (+221,777,231,792 ). He prays every time you call tell him that you want to talk with me, so that he will send for me in the camp hostels to come and answer your call. Life here in the refugee camp is very stressful and I honestly please help me out of here soon.
=A0
Please listen to this, my late father of blessed memory deposited the sum of $ 7,500,000,00 (Seven million five hundred thousand dollars) in a Bank Europe with my name as the next of kin. However, I will transmit the necessary documents on confirmation of your acceptance to assist me to transfer funds to bank accounts in my name. As you will help me in an investment and I like to finish my study at home, as I said before, as I was in my first year at university, when the crisis started. After the transfer you will arrange for my trip there for joining us to share this feelings face to face. I tried all my best and explain my conditions here at the bank in Europe, but was told that my status as a refugee in Senegal does not allow me to these a transaction, unless you find someone to help me, (perhaps my relatives, trusted friends or partners).
To be honest with you, I prefer to tell my secrets to a stranger because he / she will not have a mind to cheat me or betray me, someone here, if people here know that I say these funds will my life be in total danger and risky here, that's why I'm about to reveal this with all my heart and trust that you will keep this confidential for my safety reasons and purposes of life, I sincerely want you to know that we will invest the 'fund together me and you, or if you do not want to be with me then be my pleasure to compensate you with 20% of the total price for the services and the balance shall be my investment capital. This is why I decided to contact you. Please all communications should be through this email address only for confidential purposes.
=A0
As soon as I receive your positive response showing your interest for me, I will put things into action immediately. I will send the contacts of the bank in Europe so that you contact them immediately for them to transfer funds to your bank accounts, please this is a legitimate money and the bank is also aware that I am the nearest relative, because I send them the documents where my father wrote my name as the next of kin and have also confirmed and said that I should look for someone to help me facilitate the transfer of funds, since I am in the refugee camp.
