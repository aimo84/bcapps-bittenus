I am happy to receive your email=2C but You have to contact Dr. Ola Ibrahim with this email address: dr_olaibrahim@live.com now without delays. I assure you he is the one that can assist you especially in obtaining the needed International Transfer Permit (ITP) and have all your funds transferred once you contact him=2C he is the right and sincere person as I have told you. There is no way he will not recognize your file as far as you can follow my simple instruction.

Dr. Ola Ibrahim is a man of desire and God fearing. He will never support bad people and is well known at the Central Bank as sincere and honest man.

I am not requesting any fee from you but you must not make it known that I am the one that contacted you and reveal the secret of those evil men to you. I need your guarantee of my security from those evil men in the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). But if you can still compensate me with any amount or gift that may come from your mind once I help you claim your payment=2C it will be highly appreciated by me.

Also inform him that your file is marked X and with painted red cover to make it easier for him to locate it.  I don't want these ungodly men here in the CBN to confiscate your fund and transfer it to their own private bank accounts.

Note that you will not need any of Anti Drug/Terrorist Clearance Certificate=3B all you will require now is to obtain the original International Transfer Permit (ITP).
