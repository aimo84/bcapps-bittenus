Thanks for your response to my proposal, please I would like you send me
text messages on Mobile: +27836718382 or you can as well call me. The basis
of our discussion will be on the below points;

1) Firstly, you are required to come down to South Africa for the opening
of a non-resident international dollar bank account through which the fund
can be transferred from into your bank account in your country after all
the approvals and documentations in your name  as the foreign beneficiary /
the next of kin to the fund. The money will be shared 50/50 of the total of
USD $41.7 MILLION I want you to know that this transaction we need small
financial support so that you can able to get everything successfully

2) Secondly, if you cannot be able to come here then I will make
arrangement with the bank on how the fund will be transfer to your bank
account without any prejudice and your passport copy or your drivers
license copy or any identity document will be needed to obtain all the
transfer documents in your name and to enable the bank transfer the funds
in your account without any delay.

But please bear in mind that the most important thing to me is on the
security and safety of the fund when transferred to your bank account in
your country, hence all I need from you is trust, sincerity and the ability
to handle this transaction confidentially.

And also to assist in the fund management after the transfer will  be a
greater advantage, which is in the investment of the fund in a good
business venture since the transfer cannot be effected unless after
approvals in your name as the foreign beneficiary/next of kin

I would like you to get back to me to indicate your possibility of
travelling down here in South Africa so that we will set up a meeting but
if you know that you cannot be able to come to South Africa for the
conclusion of this transfer, then you will also have to let me know so that
I will make an arrangement with the bank for the release of the fund to
your name. And this transaction will require financial support

Your good advice, suggestions and positive ideas will be highly needed.

Your prompt response will be appreciated.

Yours sincerely,

Mr.Jaffe Thabo Zuma
