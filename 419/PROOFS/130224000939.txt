Dear Leonard,

Thank you for your response,

Meanwhile,I have decided to give you more details and also the modalities
for a speedy realization of this transaction. I=92m doing this in conformity
with our desire to enjoy the proceeds of this transaction with absolute
peace of mind after the successful transfer of these funds into your
nominated account.

Before proceeding to give you details of this project and the modalities
for its conclusion, it is pertinent to address a very important issue,
which if not properly tackled, could cause an impediment to the progress of
this transaction. This issue is confidentiality. I believe that its
importance cannot be over emphasized, taking into consideration the very
nature of this transaction. Very many people in my country and I=92m sure
also in yours, will do anything to get their hands on this kind of funds we
are talking about. So we must exercise all forms of caution. Apart from
this, the fact that its direct participants i.e. I am a career civil
servant that is still in active banking service and would not want my image
tarnished or jeopardized is most important. I have been given the kind of
position people wait a lifetime to attain. On our part, I totally disposed
to maintenance of absolute Confidentiality, and I cannot perform less. I
therefore ask you
to equally adhere to this collective wish. Be rest assured that this
project is risk free and fail proof to all intents and purposes.

I hope you would not betray me. As for Trust, it is a given thing that
trust is earned, it is not given out lightly, however, because I need you
in this transaction, That is why I have decided to give you 40% of this
money. I believe that this will keep you from refusing to give my own share
of the money if the transaction is completed. We shall hire an attorney.

The attorney will file in the Federal High court with an appropriate
affidavit in order to secure a letter of administration empowering you as
the next of kin/Sole Beneficiary and Trustee/Sole Executor of the Estate of
Mr. SADOVAL PRAVIN which includes the sum of US$28M lying in the account
with us.

The essence of hiring attorney is to make sure that people will not have
the details of this transaction and thereby preventing them from knowing
that this is a deal. Upon preparation of these documents and approvals from
the Ministry of Justice, the letter of administration will be granted in
your favor that will give you the authority to request for the transfer of
this money to your account.

The Foreign payment and remittance officer of our bank will be notified by
the attorney to remit the fund to your correspondence bank which I shall
open in Europe or America on your behalf and the fund will then be transfer
to your nominated account. The Attorney will handle all the processes of
obtaining the approvals on your behalf. All these processes will be
accomplished within 10 working days and the money transferred to your
account immediately.

The very good thing about this transaction is that it will be done in a
very proper and legal manner. I request your assistance as a foreigner to
provide a personal account where this money will be transferred into after
the documentations and necessary approvals obtained in your name with the
information as follows:

1.Your name and address
2.Your bank name and address account name and account number
3.Your phone/fax number
4 A scan copy of your International Passport/Driver=92s license.

On completion of this transaction, you will be required to hold this fund
in your account until I come over to your country for the sharing of the
money. Please confirm your willingness by replying this mail and also
reassuring me that you are going to keep this business very secret and
confidential, that you won=92t tell it to any body. All modalities for the
successful completion of this transaction have been mapped out provided
that you keep to my instructions which I shall hand over to you from time
to time for a successful completion. For security reasons, I would not give
you my phone numbers as my bank pays for it and they monitor all calls made
and receive by me.

Thank you, as I will be waiting to hear from you as soon as possible.

Best Regards,

Dr. Hamilton Wilkins.
