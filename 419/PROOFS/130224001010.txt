Hi Tina, I got the numbers you sent for the $50, and i took the money together with my 40 and paid the Dhl this morning for the yellow tag and they needed a lawyer fee of $110 to sign and stamp the yellow tag before the card will be delivered to your house.

I want you to try borrowing or gather for loan for this lawyer signing and stamping fee of $110 because i dont have anymore money with me here.

try your possible best.

Thanks
Barrister Clifton Dunn II.
