Dear Friend,
I am sorry for my late reply due to my health predicament as I most grateful for your mail and I seize this opportunity to thank you for coming to my rescue and to also let you know that this transaction is a straight forward and 100% legal transaction. I am somebody with a conscience. If this transaction was in any way illegal, I would tell you straight away so that you know what is involved and decide for yourself. I still think 10% of USD$65.000.000.00 million will be very good for your time and effort so you can have enough funds to reach the less privileged people.
I hope you were not too embarrassed by my first email to you since you do not know me. I don't want you to feel sorry for me, because I believe everyone will die someday , I have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment and right now I have only about a few months to live according to medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life so well since my wife and 3 children died in a car accident, since then I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but only my business.
Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world, I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it.
Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends. I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia, Thailand.
Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which I have there to charity organizations in Asia and America; they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of USD$65 million dollars (Sixty five million United states dollars) that I have with a finance institution in Europe. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity organizations.
I didn=E2=80=99t know how to move the funds out and dispatch it to charity organizations, so I resulted to putting fate to test and making a random contact. I got your email address from the web email directory and decided to introduce my plight and this transaction. I am communicating with only you at this moment with regards to this transaction. And I  would not have any cause to do otherwise, except you state your intention to withdraw your assistance.
Just like I stated in my first mail to you that I want you to assist me, I cannot dispatch these funds myself as a result of,
(1) I am undergoing medical treatment. It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts
(2) I want God to be merciful to me, I have decided to give financial support charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth..
It is for this reasons I am seeking for your assistance to stand as the next of kin to my fund and retrieve it on my behalf and dispatched it to charity organizations after we must have come to a conclusion and reached an agreement. Not before.
I need you to give me your words that you will be very honest and straight forward with me when the money gets to you, So long as you can execute this transaction successfully and help me dispatched it to charity organizations.
Thus, I would need you to get back to me on the following issues,
 (1) That you are in a position to be trusted as a God fearing person with such a large amount of fund and dispatched it to charity organization.
 (2) That you ready to sign a letter of guarantee with my lawyer on behalf of me due to my health problem, clearly stating the terms of this transaction, including your percentages and dispatching the remaining funds to charity organizations, as my lawyer will be a living witness that you fulfill your promise of dispatching my funds to charity organizations so that I am assured that the money would be safe in your hands even when I finally pass to decease.
(3) That you fully understand this transaction up to this stage and you are ready to proceed under these terms.
As soon as I receive your reply that you are ready to proceed under these terms, then I will furnish you with all details for the secure of the release of my fund and dispatch to charity. But if you have any questions up to this stage, please ask and I will be more than happy to respond to them. Thanks for your mail, your mail has relieved me and I pray to almighty GOD with his infinite mercy to reward you. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it now. I want you to pray for me so that God would forgive me and be merciful to me and accept my soul
I have attached my pictures for you to know who you are dealing with.
May God bless you as I await your reply
Regards,
