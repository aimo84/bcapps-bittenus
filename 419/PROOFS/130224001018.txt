Dear=2C=20

=20

Thank you for your prompt
reply to my previous mail for soliciting your assistance and collaboration in
actualizing this project

=20

I have contacted you in my search for a very reliable investor partner abroad
who will be interested in a working partnership since this project require the
assistance and participation of a foreigner to stand in as the Real Bonafide
owner of the fund. I  also stand to assure you that there is no risks in
this transaction for it is legal=2C risk free and will be one hundred percent
(100%) successful because all logistics are in place and all modalities worked
out for a smooth actualization of the transfer of this fund to you.

As a banker working in the Foreign Remittance Department=2C I want you to know
that I have acted as the Account Officer to most of these politicians=2C so I
have being involved and participated in many financial transfer transaction
done by this corrupt politicians several times to the Overseas.

When I now discover that this politicians were using me to achieve their aims
by transferring this huge amount of fund through our bank to the Overseas=2C I
decided to use my opportunity as a top bank official to divert the sum of $8.5
Million to an Escrow Account belonging to no one in the bank and then clean up
the records and files concerning this $8.5 Million from our Bank Data-base
processing Financial Deposit so that there will be no trace of this fund.

Now the reason why I have contacted you is this=3B the bank management is now
anxious to know who owns this account that has this fund ($8.5 Million) because
the bank has benefited and made lot of profits from this fund for almost six
years now. I need a trustworthy and honest foreign partner that I will present
to the bank as the owner of the account having this said fund ($8.58Million).

The best way to transfer this fund to you is through the issuance of the total
fund in an Automated teller Machin(ATM) visa card =2Cthe system will  enable
you pull the fund little by little upon confirmation in your country.  It
is best option to transfer fund nowadays since it is no longer easy to transfer
huge amount of fund from one country to another due to the international money
tracking system and cumbersome clearance issues  .

The total fund will be upgraded in your name into an Automated teller Machine
ATM visa card=2CAfter the management approval of your claim and upon the up
gradation of the fund in your name as the recipient=2C it will be sent  to=20
your nominated address in your country  and upon receiving it=2C you will
start withdrawal little by little until the total fund is exhausted in the
automated bank account .

Note=3B I accept to offer you 40% out of the total sum involved while the
remaining 60% will be mine. Upon receipt of your response I will file in your
names in our bank as the owner of the said fund =2Cthen send you an application
for to fill and apply to our bank requesting for the release of the said funds
in your favour.please send me your telephone number .waiting to hear from you
soonest.

Regards=2C

Mr Lamido Ali.
