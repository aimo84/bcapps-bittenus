Dearest Leonard,

Greetings and thank you for your prompt response and concerns.

I am happy that you are a true Christian hence the lord knows why he directed these projects unto you. I believe that you will make judicious use of this fund to what I did outline in my previous email to you based on the contents of your brief mail herein.

I have taken this decision because it was the wish of my late husband and for the fact that my late husband brothers are taking care of my treatment and otherwise, so I have to sow this seed and which may eventually brings miraculous healing and otherwise to me.

I want you therefore to promise me that you will handle these projects as I said therein and then send me your details so that I will submit it to the bank for official introduction and ask them to contact you towards concluding it. I will also send you the contact of the bank so that you can relate with them directly and advise them where necessary.

I will tell the bank about you as my overseas partner(since they are aware of my intentions) and will send you all the related documents to this fund as well authorization letter while I pray to God to give you the grace and strength to continue his work as you are doing or intend doing and handle these projects to the best of your ability to the glory of the lord and service to humanity.

Thank you and Gods continued blessings while I look forward to reading from you again and request you put me in your daily prayers.

Blessings,

Mrs.Justina Amicha
