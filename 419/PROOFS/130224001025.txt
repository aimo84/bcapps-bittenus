Dear Friend,=C2=A0Thank you for your response. I contacted you concerning a deceased customer Aziz Musa Numan (An Iraqi Crude oil merchant), and an investment he placed under our banks management.=C2=A0In June 2001, Aziz Musa Numan invested 18.3 million United States dollars in our private banking division. Based on my advice, we were able to spin the initial deposit with profit and interest to 22.5 million United States dollars arising from the numerous investments on stocks and bonds.=C2=A0Upon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war (U.S and Iraqi war), seven years ago (2003. After series of investigation, I got information that Aziz Musa Numan and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit his home at Mukaradeeb.Because of the sensitive nature of private banking, most customers want to leave no traces and rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in
 most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; our now deceased client died in-testate.=C2=A0It is quite clear now that our dear client died with no known or identifiable family member. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of Nine {9} years the funds will revert to the ownership of Hang Seng Bank Ltd, and then the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds after five years.=C2=A0In essence, there is US$22,500,000.00 deposit lying unclaimed that I want you to stand as the next of kin to claim. I will furnish the necessary details to you as the closest surviving relation and instructions to complete this project successfully. Your share will be 30% of the US$22,500,000.00. Please let me know in your next correspondence if the above sharing ratio is okay by you.=C2=A0I will give you the relevant modus operandi to initiate this process towards a conclusion. Do not betray me or my confidence if you are not
 interested. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. I await your response.=C2=A0Peter.
