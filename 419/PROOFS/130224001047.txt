Attention: Leonard Zeptowitz

According
 to the content of the previous mail you received=2C you were being=20
informed that your Contract Beneficiary fund is ready and the payment=20
method which you are to receive your Contract payment is via VISA ATM=20
CARD which is currently ready to be mailed out to your home or work=20
address. The Federal Government has taking care of all the taxes and=20
charges from their own pocket=2C so therefore the fee your are requested=20
to pay is your Permission to Transfer Fund fee which is called (PTF) and
 your ATM VISA CARD will be deliver to your home address without further
 delay or stop from any where in the world.

Now your payment will
 be send to you by ATM CARD that will be coming alongside a custom pin=20
which you will use to withdraw up to $10=2C000 per day from any ATM=20
machine that has the Visa or Master Card Logo on it. Also with the ATM=20
card you will be able to transfer your funds to your bank account=20
online=2C because the ATM card will be registered with Inter switch. The=20
ATM card comes with a handbook or manual to enlighten you about how to=20
use it.  Your ATM card would be sent to you via DHL or any other=20
delivery agents. Because we have signed a contract with DHL or the=20
agents which should expired by December 1st 2013.

We want you to=20
know that this office dose not issue out Legal Documentation online due=20
to security reasons. Once we received the requested PTF fee from you=2C=20
your ATM CARD will be mailed out to you immediately together with your=20
documentations of proof. Including your proof of fund ownership=20
Certificate will also be mail to your home address live so that you will
 have to sign them once you receive them.

The attached document=20
is a copy of our Vanguard Newspaper that was published on the 31st of=20
July 2012=2C of which the Federal Government of Nigeria listed 7=20
beneficiaries that were to receive their own beneficiary fund payment=20
last year. Among the listed beneficiaries you will find out that you are
 number 7 on the list and the number 2 happens to be the the Woman that=20
has already received her own 10.5 Million beneficiary fund payment=20
through VISA ATM CARD on the 14th of January 2013.

Below is her tracking number=3B
Name=3B ANNEWIGAND :
TRACKING NO: 1Z73257A0477547498 (UPS TRACKING NUMBER).

The
 (PTF) which is YOUR PERMISSION TO TRANSFER FUND will cost you $550=20
only. Once you send the requested fee get back to the office with the=20
payment information so that we can proceed further in the delivery of=20
your ATM CARD.

Attached is my Working ID Card and For oral=20
