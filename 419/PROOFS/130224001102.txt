Thanks for your reply.

Your response suggests to me that you are willing to work with me on this project. As much as I desire your cooperation=2C I will state the very crucial issues here. In everything one does with another=2C there is need for a meeting of minds. Without us both seeing and assessing this deal through the same lenses there cannot and will never be success or progress. So please leave your mind transparent and your heart open to assess this operation with a brave heart. There is need for you to obey my every instruction and do exactly as I say in other to avoid mistake(s) since I am the master planner. You must let me direct this project for us to have success. It is when there is no leadership and no meeting of minds that there are problems. We have to bear this in mind. I do not seek to lead you by the nose and lead you into anything you did not bargain for=2C but I must be able to dictate the pace because only I have the key and knowledge to unravel this project=2C but since I cannot present my self as the next of kin to my late client=2C that is why I ask you to partner with me and act as one. There is absolutely no risk involved in this deal if only we can both make it a secret. I have the ability to acquire all the legal documents to back up your claims. So all you need to do is to apply for the claim as a maternal relative since you do not have the same surname with my late client. Your country of residence does not matter in this project because you are standing as a maternal relative.
=20
You must understand what we stand before. We are about to make alot of money for ourselves. The total credit of my late client with the BANK is $6=2C000=2C000.00 USD (Six Million United States Dollars). I alone have the deposit details and the bank will not release the deposit to anyone unless I instructs them to do so. Once you file a claim to the bank as the next of kin to my late client=2C they will definately contact me as the account custodian/legal representative without your knowledge for sign-off. I will endorse the report and give them the legal authorization they need to release the fund to you since you have all the required documents I will secretly provide for you. The risk element in this deal is zero and this is guaranteed so long as no one is able to trace any link or connection between you and me.
=20
I have ensured due to the allowances of my legal jurisdiction that there is as little documentation about this title transfer as possible. The manner my client submitted his data helps us so there is little or no background for us to conform to. We do not have the need to make any submissions to prove anything. No paper work between you and the BANK=2C just instructions from my law firm to the BANK. The bank in question "Lloyds TSB" is a very reputable financial institution=3B they are affiliated with  top Swiss banks=2C sensitive institution and multi-nationals. They are private and exclusive. They are security deposit accepting firm and experts who transact annually with hundreds of millions of Euros on behalf of banks and many others. I tell you this in strictest of confidence for their status is one of the complex intricacies of the modern financial world. I do not wish for this information on the bank to pass beyond us. They are purely a financial institution working confidentially for certain bodies. Just as you would not want this project to be common knowledge=2C so do I. I repeat myself in uncertain and unequivocal terms: this is a private and confidential arrangement involving only you and me knowing the FULL and COMPLETE details. The success of this project is contingent upon you knowing your place and knowing your limitations. I have worked in the legal world for many years and many consider me a guru in my field. I got where I am today by being smart and hardworking=2C but most importantly by being disciplined.
=20
I have taken a leap of faith in proceeding the way I have with you. I should first have met with you to gauge your seriousness and see if you are trustworthy=2C but one thing I have learned from the wealthy clients I have managed in the past few years is that nothing in life comes easy and nothing ventured nothing gained. I want you to take this word of promise from my heart that all is well and will end well. "My word is my bond". In approximately 6 days=2C we should be through with this project if we put our minds to it. I have a family I love so much and we must seize this opportunity to better both our lives. We must take this situation seriously=2C great opportunities barely come twice.
