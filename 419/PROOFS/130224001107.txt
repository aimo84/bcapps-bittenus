Dear Beloved,

I am glad to receive your reply. As I told you earlier on my previous mail,
My name is Miss Mirian Kassala Rodriguez, I=92m single lady of 26 year old
from Libya, am an African Mexican by birth but I=92m presently now living in
a refugee camp here in Nigeria due to a political crises in my Country
under Gadaffi regime. My parents and relatives were killed during the
crises remaining only me because I was lucky to be among those rescued by
the United Nation army that came to stop the crises.,Since then I have been
an orphan suffering here in this refugee camp without receiving any help.

While my late Father was alive, he deposited some amount of money worth of
(2.7 million pounds) with a London bank which I inherited after his death.
l would also like you to know that l have my late father's death
certificate and on bank login of (2.7 million pounds) with me which l will
like to send to you to assist me transfer this money into your account and
from it you will send some money for me to get my traveling documents and
air ticket to come over to meet you in your country. I can't withdraw the
money myself due to some conditions of things here in this country which I
am not permitted to do, and the money can't be transferred here in Nigeria
due to my refugee status. I got your contact through God's intervention and
direction while browsing and I prayed over it and God revealed to me that
you are the chosen one to help me out of my bad condition. Please don=92t
consider my request as one of those internet stuff rather see it as a
challenge to safe my life and to bring me out of this painful situation.

Over here in this refugee camp, I do not have right to anything be it money
or what ever because it is against the law of the refugee authority here.
We are being taken care by Rev Father John Paul and he has been so nice to
us. I am using his office computer to send you this mail so please if you
want to talk to me on phone, please contact me through the Rev Father
office phone number at +2348037599583, When you call just tell the Rev
Father that you want to speak with Miss Mirian Kassala, he will send for me
to come and answer your call in his office.

I have made my request known to the Bank through mail and they have
accepted it and instructed me to present a responsible person who will
stand on my behalf as a foreign partner/trustee for the transfer and to
help me receive the money on my behalf since l am presently a refugee
status over here which I am not permitted to handle this amount of money.
The bank also let me know about the bonds which they signed with my late
Father that the money will be handled over to me in bulk amount which means
that l should decide on if l should continue with the bank or not.

I am putting all my trust in you although I do not know you in person, but
I have full trust in you as I am being lead by God. I want you to keep this
matter secret between us until we get the money from the bank. Please,
promise me that if you received this money into your account that you are
going to keep it safe and help me come over to your country and start a new
life because life here in this refugee camp is hell.

Dear beloved May Allah/God bless you abundantly as you help me out from
this problem. I will be waiting for your positive reply.

 Yours truly.
 Mirian Kassala Rodriguez
