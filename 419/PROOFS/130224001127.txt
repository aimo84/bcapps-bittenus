Dear  Zeptowitz,

Thanks for your reply and contents well noted.

In respect of your mail, to the aforementioned, i will want to inform you
that i have written explanation for you to read and get back to me.

I am looking forward to working with you. I have the trust on you, and I
believe you have the same on me as you know that this transaction requires
mutual trust and dedication to achieve this golden objective, but I now
need your co-operation so that we can together retrieve this money from the
Security Company for our benefit.Please note that every piece of
information I give you is based on information giving to me by my late
client Mr.Alex  Zeptowitz and I have confirmed the truth based on inquiry
from the Security Company. Before the death of my client Mr. Zeptowitz he
left behind an amount of 9 Million United States Dollars.

Firstly,i want to inform you that i have an exclusive signatory right over
his chattels, this is only if it is corresponded by an identifiable next of
kin,I can present anyone as the beneficiary as I was his personal attorney.
you can claim this fund as the next of kin to my late client. As planned, I
want to get this money out before it gets confiscated at the security
company where the money was deposited by my late client. With your full
co-operation, I have no doubt we shall succeed.Now, the first step towards
the realization of our goal is to proceed to the Swiss High Court here in
my Country to obtain some classified documents in your name.
These documents are:

Certificate of administration,
Affidavit of next of kin and the
Letter of Probate

All these documents will show that you are the next of kin and beneficiary
of this fund. We will obtain these documents,register and notarise them in
the Swiss High Court. Though it will cost us some little money to
process,which i believe that we can make up,after this is done,you can now
be qualified to apply for this claim and present these documents.Of course
the money will thereafter be released to you.You shall be needed to endorse
some important documents showing you are the beneficiary. I will require
some information about yourself,Name,Mailing Address,Telephone and
Fax,Occupation and Pictorial Identification  to swear an affidavit of claim
in the court stating that you are the beneficiary of my client's estate
being his next of kin. Please include any form of identification so that we
can submit an application to the Swiss High Court to enable me obtain this
Affidavit of claim before the Holding Firm will require for the
documents.The processing of the legal document will commence,because i will
be going to the Swiss High Court, and a copy will be sent to you for your
reference and to enable us contact the Security Company for the processing
of the claim. As the personal attorney to my late client  Zeptowitz, it
will take me only 3 days to obtain these certificates. As soon as we obtain
all these documents we shall then apply for the claim of the money and put
your name as the applicant and put your bank account as the receiving
account.

Note that you will be required to write a formal application to the Company
requesting for the claim.  As soon as the fund is secured and in your
possession, I will require a letter of invitation to enable me come over to
meet you so as to discuss the possibility of investing in your country for
the future of our children and other modalities which will depend on our
level of financial commitment, etc.You shall need to send me your
identification and i will also send you mine.The money would be released in
your name and it will be in your account so I will not like to get
dissapointed by you after this is concluded.I know if we both agree to
co-operate, we shall see the successful end of this and we shall smile.

Hoping to have a successful business relationship with you. Be rest assured
that this is 100% risk free and absolutely legal.Note also that I am not
looking for personal benefits.Rather I am looking for the interests of the
two of us,and we are surely going to succeed in this enterprise.

My direct telephone number +41766380221.

I believe that this will be the beginning of a long lasting relationship.

A cordial response will be appreciated.

Best Regards,

Barr, William Poker.
