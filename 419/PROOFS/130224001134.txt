Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,=A0Thank you very much for your details and response to my business proposal, I really appreciate your gesture. Let me use this opportunity to re-affirm that my decision to carry out this transaction with you is with all sincerity of purpose. What I simply require from you is for you to assure me that the money will be safe in your hands and that you will maintain a high level of confidentiality, which this transaction demands. The funds in question belongs to a customer of my bank who is now deceased, you are a foreigner which makes you perfect for this transaction, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out by me for the funds to be released to you via my bank as the beneficiary's next of kin. I must let you know that all that is required from you is trust and sincerity and most importantly transparent honesty in this project for us to
 succeed.With your advised information, I shall commence with the affidavit, together with the probate=A0registry=A0certification from a high court on your behalf which I shall communicate to my bank along with all other relevant documents to enable you administer the funds of the deceased into your own account, as well as secure a transfer approval in your favor. I will need a copy of your international passport as guarantee to at least know who I am dealing with. I must let you know that my future finances depends on the successful conclusion of this project bearing in mind that I will be investing my all by reposing a great magnitude of trust and money in you, expecting that you will not let me down as it will cost me so much to secure the probate documents and other necessary documents in your favor from=A0Switzerland.Your role is basically to front as the next of kin, so as to put in a claim for the said funds and the money will be transferred to you
 by normal banking transfer method through a corresponding bank to be on a safer side. Transaction of this magnitude is not cheap, but before we commence this, I will require from you any form of identification of yourself. =A0I need you to send me any valid identification e.g. your drivers license or a copy of your international passport. You can scan and send to me through email attachment for me to have recognition of whom I am dealing with. This is very important for us to begin and also let me have your full names contact address as well as your direct phone number for me to reach you.Please be rest assured as all modalities have been set to ensure the completion of the transaction within ten working days from the date we file in your letter of claim. Also this transaction requires utmost confidentiality, trust and commitment on both sides.As we have not had any personal contact we should try and show true transparency and honesty in the course of
 this transaction, as we shall have cause to celebrate at the end.=A0Note that I am a seasoned banker who knows the intricacies involved both local and international banking laws as the case may be. All inheritance taxes here in Bern will be taken care of by me as well as handle all aspects with my bank to release the funds in your favor =A0via the security company. I will be the one to secure the change of beneficiary documents in your favor as all modalities have been put in place to achieve this goal. Once this is presented to my bank, an approval for the deposit with the security company that I shall influence will be granted for the funds to be paid to you directly or through the correspondent bank, as I shall specify in the beneficiary applications for transfer approval.=A0I required you possess a good account to house the funds, pending the eventual transfer into your bank account. Once we have the transfer approval and the funds redirected to our
 correspondent bank in your=A0favor, you can also effect the transfer online via the Internet into your bank account from the comfort of your home. Please, note that I will be retiring next year,=A0having put in some many years in the banking industry and as such I would not want to compromise my career. Keep this highly confidential. If I could do this alone I would not have contacted you. I believe that I have been explicit enough. You shall be duly compensated as earlier stated. Let me have a good time to call you for further discussions especially as regards the sharing of the proceeds after transfer is completed.=A0I wait to hear from you for us to proceed.Regards,=A0Heinz Hager.
