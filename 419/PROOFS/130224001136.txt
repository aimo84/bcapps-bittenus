Dear  Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thanks for your interest in this prevailing opportunity; I am happy that
you are willing to assist me save the fund from being siphoned by corrupt
bank officials here in Togo. I contacted you in this matter owing that you
bear the same last name with my late client, Engr. Mikhail B. Zeptowitz
and of the same nationality.  I am Hon Richard Murphy Esq. from Lome Togo
West Africa and I want you to know that its destiny that brought us
together.

My proposal came to you because my late who died with his supposed Next of
Kin/Heiress Apparent Rose (Daughter). I have searched for any other members
of his relative without any fruitful result; it was until the bank sent me
a notice of their resolution to confiscate the estate in line with their
abandoned property decree since I was not able to locate any member of his
relative that I decide to contact you for this claim as his only SURVIVING
RELATIVE since you bear the same last name with him.

Therefore, in a situation of this kind, it's not published and the
respective financial institution only informs the customer's attorney as
the case may be and then only waits for the real heir to show up as the
availability of such funds are expected to be in the late "customer's will
" which would be the only source of knowledge of it by anybody who is
entitle to such estate but the real heir was also involved in the accident.

If this fund is not claimed, it will be re-deposited into the treasury of
the finance firm as unclaimed bill which be shared among the board of
directors due to high level of corruption here and that will become
history. There is nothing to worry about as everything is legal with
documentations, it is my duty to provide the next of kin and whosoever I
approve as the next of kin will become the beneficiary and receive the fund.

The most important issue to be considered now is trust and confidence in
this matter hence I plead this should be our watch word throughout this
transaction and I can fully assure you on my own part that as much as I
work this with you, I will always remain the same.

More so, you shall admit with me that since my late client died
intestate(without a written will) and the apparent heiress died with him,
that his estate will be inherited by statute, and this statute according to
the customary law of Togo accord any surviving member of his family "right
to claim=94. It is on this wise that I contacted you, since you bear the same
surname with my late client; this will stand as a nexus to establish
un-doubtful kinship between you and my late client.

Having understood the process of this claim, hereunder is what we stand to
benefit in this claim, the fund in question is $7.5m (Seven Million, Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars). After the successful transfer of
the fund into your designated account in your country, 45% of the total
fund will be for you, 45% will be for me and my family while the remaining
10% will be used to establish the charitable foundation in your country in
the name of my late client. If you have any question regarding this sharing
ratio, feel free, this is a deal.

Claims prerequisites: As his personal Attorney, I am required to know the
detail information of any The required information:

1, Your full names:
2, Contact Address:
3, Phone number:
4, Date of Birth:
5, Place of Birth:
6, Occupation:
7, Marital Status:

Be it as it may, the information is needed to present you officially to the
finance firm with a draft application letter of claim which will be backed
by a sworn Affidavit of claim sworn in the High Court of Togo, Lome
Jurisdiction.

This is preceded by an application for a grant of letters of Administration
by the probate appointing you as the executor/administration of the said
estate.

I want to assure that you have nothing to worry about as all proceedings
will be legal and legitimate, at least as an intellectual you can ascertain
actions that may be considered repugnance to the law. I want to also assure
you that the bank where the fund was domiciled is only acting as caretaker
of the estate, as his personal attorney; the bank will release the fund to
whomever I present to them.

All you need do is to adhere to my instructions and all will be fine.
Best regards,
Hon.Richard Murphy Esq
