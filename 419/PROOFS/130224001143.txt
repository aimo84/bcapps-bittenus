I thank you for the mail in response to the inheritance fund.

The procedure for the transaction is that documents will be obtained from relevant departments here in your favor to give you the legal right as the next-of-kin and beneficiary of the fund. The bank here in processing the transfer of the fund to your account in your country will use the documents obtained in your favor. I therefore need the following details: your full names including surname,your private telephone and fax numbers, age/date of birth, residential address, occupation,A copy of your international passport copy, company name (if you have private company).
