Mr. Leonard,
=A0
You mean you are not aware of your fund which has been moved to bank of Canada by Phillip Lofty the bank director of UBS AG Switzerland??
Your partner Craig James said that you are aware of everything and have been in contact with Phillip before the fund was moved to Canada. So you need to contact Phillip now=A0to give you the full information of the bank in Canada where you are expected to go and clear the funds into your account.
I am the lawyer who processed the preliminary enabling documents used in getting the transfer approval from the authorities in your favor as the legal beneficiary, and i would have contacted you since but i was not authorized.
