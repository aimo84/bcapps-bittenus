Read Carefully.

Thank you for your brief email response. Let me=20
try to explain to you first and the details of this project because it=20
is important that you understand why you have been contacted in the=20
first instance. I will appreciate your proper understanding in=20
accordance of this transaction. I want you to trust me on this basis=2C=20
your fullest co-operation is all we need to be able to ascertain a vivid
 clarity of this fund.

I am from the UNITED KINGDOM and I=20
will be very glad to meet you in person (IF POSSIBLE) to ascertain a=20
vivid clarity of this transaction=2C But=2C since my official work is the=20
type that holds me down from traveling anytime=2C we will have to schedule
 a meeting after we complete the deal. However before then=2C it is=20
important for me to know of your interest in this matter especially when
 you only got my email on the net. But bear it in mind emphatically that
 you are being contacted for something legitimate. I have all the legal=20
backings to pull this through as long as i have confidence in your=20
fullest co-operation and understanding of this matter. =20

The=20
case of our client is an unusual one as his death was abrupt and without
 a will covering this sum mentioned to you. This leaves us no choice but
 to appoint an inheritor. I have the responsibility to sort out the=20
administrative details on his death.I have the power to decide what=20
happens to this sum as it will be administered in accordance with strict
 rules and regulations known as "Rules of Intestacy". I needed a very=20
reputable person to be nominated as the beneficiary outside the UNITED=20
KINGDOM rather than allow these funds to be confiscated. So=2C like I said
 in my earlier email to you=2C I am contacting you because you bear the=20
same name as our late client NOT that you are related to him. The name=20
of our late client was Mr. Raymond Zeptowitz By this I can very easily=20
file in for the sum to be released to your account as the inheritor of=20
the sum.

Be reminded that=2C I am NOT saying you are related to
 the Testator but since you bear the same name as "Zeptowitz" this=20
transaction can be very easily accomplished. Again=2C please know that to=20
accomplish this transaction more quickly and without any hindrance=2C you=20
must understand that I will need your fullest support. This can be more=20
easily achieve only if you understand the details of the transaction.=20
Please=2C note that I will also demand maximum confidentiality or=20
discreteness in all matters.

All the necessary legal=20
documentations will be in place.You are at liberty to reach the=20
undersigned by phone in the event of further query=2Cas this will enable=20
me further explain the steps to be taken in realizing this project. I=20
await your early response and there be any question=2C do not hesitate to=20
ask=2C because=2C your total understanding will help to ease our further=20
plans to actualize the goal of this transaction. Find attach a copy of=20
my International Passport to know whom have contacted you.

Regards=2C
