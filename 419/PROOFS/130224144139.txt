OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN
PRESIDENTIAL TENDER BOARD COMMITTEE
NIGERIA NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION [NNPC]
NNPC HEADQUARTERS ABUJA-NIGERIA.
REF: (NNPC) CONTRACT PAYMENT NOTIFICATION.

Dear Leonard Zeptowitz

Dated this 13th day of February, 2013.

This is to bring to your notice that the Presidential Petroleum Tender Board Committee of the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) have resolved to take charge of all contract inheritance payments of all contractors/beneficiaries, in between 1998/2008 contract done by various foreign contractors,including you, under the administration and leadership of Sani Abacha dictatorship and Chief of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, upon themselves. It is my pleasure to inform you that the senate has signed and approved for immediate payment, the total sum of $12.5m (Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand Dollars only).

We have also discovered that you are being contacted on daily basis by some non officials of CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA (CBN) OCEANIC BANK, ZENITH BANK, UBA BANK, UNION BANK, CITI BANK, SKYE BANK, ECO BANK,and the United Nations and other bodies both in Nigeria and outside Nigeria, including the offices of . Mallam Sanusi, MR. PATRICK AZIZA, MR. FRANK NWEKE, and many other bodies,claiming to be in position to pay your fund. Henceforth, you are cautioned to stop further transaction with any other body (s), bank, office (s) regarding your contract payment, until you obtain FINAL CLEARANCE/APPROVAL from this office. Be reminded that you could fall victim to the gang of fraudsters here or be exploited by the several corrupt Nigeria officials, who parade themselves as being in the position to pay your contract fund. In a swift crusade towards the enforcement of your contract debt, the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) have been authorized by the Senate and President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to take charge of payment of all NNPC and Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF) contractors through the 30% fund generated from the corporation proceeds. This is contained in the officials gazette recently released by the President, (DR. GOODLUCK EBELE JOHNATHAN)

Be further informed that after due investigations, it was however discovered that the reason you haven't received your contract payment all this while is because you have been dealing with these corrupt officials who previously handled your transaction and who had the intentions of diverting some part of your funds to their private accounts overseas. And also, because, this board have received numerous letters from different people who claim to be either your partner or Attorney, who request that the money be paid to their own bank account, stating that you are on sick bed in hospital and have given them the authority to receive cash call remittance on your behalf. But because they failed to provide enough proof for their claims, the money has not been paid to them.

In this regard, all modalities have been put in place for the immediate release of your contract payment as soon as reconfirmation message is received from you.

1.Your full Name___________
2. Your Mailing Address. (Not P.O Box)___________ Country of Residence_________
3. Your Direct Telephone Number.______________
4. Company's Name & Position ____________
5. Sex_____, Age______& Marital Status_________

9. Your Total Contract Value (Amount__________)
10. A scanned copy of your ID.

Be also informed that your payment has been scheduled to be paid to you via Bank Transfer.

And for this reason, and for the safety of your funds, your total fund valued at $12.5 (Twelve million Five hundred thousand dollars) have been deposited in an Escrow Account for safe Keeping until you come for the claim.

Your effort in responding to this email will be immensely cherished and appreciated.
