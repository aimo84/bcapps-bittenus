I hope you were not too embarrassed by my first email to you since you
do not know me. I had no option since my immediate and extended family
in and outside Dubai refused to distribute my funds because they want
to keep it to themselves.

decided to introduce myself to you.

to discuss the terms of releasing the funds($21=2C000=2C000.00).
