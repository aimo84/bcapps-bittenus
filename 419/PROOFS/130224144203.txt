Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thank you once more for writing me. I wish to explain further the steps
involved in this process and hope the fund will be transferred to you
within 14 days, provided you follow my guidelines. The fund is deposited
with Lloyds TSB Bank plc., here in London and the account has been dormant
for over 3 years.

I will tell the deceased's lawyer, who is based here in London about you so
that he can make applications to Lloyds TSB Bank for the fund to be release
to you. Once you make contact with her, the Lawyer will reply to confirm
your relationship claims with the deceased. She will ask you several
questions about late Dr. Bill which I will have answers to and all you have
to do is forward the correspondence to me so that I can address it. The
Lawyer will check through the submitted details to make sure it corresponds
with what they have on file for the deceased and adopt you as the relative.
It is then that the Lawyer will apply to the Bank to release the funds to
you in line with the constitutional demands.

I wish to assure you that nothing the lawyer will ask of will be beyond our
reach. I hope we have established a memorandum of understanding binding
this transaction as per the percentages in sharing the fund once it is
credited to your account. It will be disheartening if you default. Since
this is a mutual transaction, I want you to know that our mutual
understanding and cooperation will ensure the realization of this
objective. I also would like you to check your e-mails regularly and
correspond with the parties involved throughout the claim process as I
cannot revert the process once I introduce you to the deceased's lawyer. If
you have any questions regarding the process, you can ask now but I do wish
to assure you that everything will run smoothly.

Note: Attached to this e-mail is a copy of the Certificate of fund deposit,
Death certificate, my International passport and my work identity card for
your perusal and further assurance. I would also like you to send me a
valid proof of your identity.

Once I get your full declaration of interest in this deal, I will introduce
you to the deceased's lawyer to proceed. You may reach me on: +44
7909518374 at any time.

Best Regards,
Steve Raju
