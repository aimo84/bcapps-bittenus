<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Feb 25th, &nbsp;2013&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;Good day Benefactor, Leonard Zeptowitz</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">It is with a heavy heart that i bring to your immediate notice, the demise of my client Lady Grace Roberts in the early hours of this morning. I hope that this news of the demise of Lady Grace is taken with a strong heart. I do regret to let you know that Mrs Grace Roberts is late and she did not survive the operation so sad, but i know wherever she is she would be glad that she contacted a trusted person like you.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">We take solace in the fact that she lived a life worthy of emulation. As those who knew her were blessed by her.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">MAY HER GENTLE SOUL REST IN PERFECT PEACE.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">When i have completed my duties as your Attorney by procuring the necessary documents to facilitate the release of the fund (35 Million Pounds) to you and i will &nbsp;have them sent to the Bank so they can Approve your inheritance application and send you the online account details of my late client before you can proceed with the transfer from Lady Grace's Account to your account.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">And also the good news is &nbsp;to inform you that i have presented the documents to the bank for authorization of the transfer, but we need to get something done ASAP which is necessary for the transaction which is the affidavits of next of kin of late Lady Grace Roberts. The affidavits need to be sworn and presented to the bank as part documents and transfer authorization, without that the bank would not want to transfer the funds to you due to security reason.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">And this document has to be sworn in the court of justice here in UK, So you have to come to Untied Kingdom your self to get the affidavit done. I need you to come before &nbsp;28/02/2013 because we need the affidavit very urgently, or if you can not make it the affidavit is going to cost 1750 GBP &nbsp;to get it for you if you can not be able to come down here, you have to act fast and let me know if you will be coming or not, at this present stage everything has been going on smoothly. As soon as we can get this Affidavits to the bank then, they can authorize to us the mode of transfer of funds to you. this has to be done fast because i found out that Mrs Grace Roberts funds is in a Dormant/Es-crew account and without things done fast the British government will seize the funds and all our efforts will be put to waste.</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">All I want from you at this stage is your total commitment to this project and prompt response to matters that may arise as they come, and also ensure strict confidential to your self only until funds have been successfully transferred to you because now that my client is late you have to ensure the safety of the funds in order to fulfill her and her late husband&rsquo;s dreams. See attached a copy of the Roberts family photogra.</p>
