Attn: Leonard Zeptowitz

As i told you in my first message and i introduce myself again i am Mr.James George 
the Chairman, Foreign Debt Reconciliation Department under the Office of the Vice President. I know you must be surprised at this development 
but I chose to tell you the truth because of my sincere wish to treat every man, as I would expect to be treated.After thorough 
investigations on contract/inheritance payment file as directed by the 
Presidency, I find out that it will take a long process for your money 
to be release due to some irregularities detected in your file. I found 
out also that you have spent so much money in trying to realize your 
payment, which did not even reflect in your file but I have an offer 
that will at least help your financial stand until you receive your 
payment. This offer is an amount from Federal Government leftover. It is a total sum of US$15,000.000.00 which will be shared between you and I in the ratio of 50-50%..

I have found out that this said fund as not yet been released to any body so i decided to write you seeking your good cooperation so that you can provide your account where this fund would be transferred to , once this money gets into your account we will share it 50%/50%. 

I need you to forward your details so that i can get the final approvals in your names as the contractor of this fund who has not yet received his payment and once this is done the payment will be wired to your account without delays.

I wait to hear from you soon.

Regards.
Mr. James George.
