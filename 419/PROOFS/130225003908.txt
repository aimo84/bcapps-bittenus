Dear Friend and Partner,=0A=C2=A0=0AThank you for considering my proposal. I contacted you concerning a deceased customer Hamadi Hashem (An Iraqi Crude oil merchant), and an investment he placed under our banks management.=0A=C2=A0=0AIn June 2001, Hamadi Hashem came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division and invested 18.3 million=C2=A0 United States =C2=A0dollars. As the officer in charge of his transaction, I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favoured route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 300 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we were able to spin the initial deposit with profit and interest to 22.5 million=C2=A0 United States =C2=A0dollars.=0A=C2=A0=0AUpon maturity several notice was sent to him, even during the war (U.S and Iraqi war), Five years ago (2003). Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. After series of investigation, I got information that Hamadi Hashem and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit his home at Mukaradeeb.=0A=C2=A0=0ABecause of the sensitive nature of private banking, most customers want to leave no traces and rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; our now deceased client died in-testate.=0A=C2=A0=0AIt is quite clear now that our dear client died with no known or identifiable family member. According to practice, the Private banking sector will by the end of this year broadcast a request for statement of claim to Hang Seng Bank Ltd, failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit to Management of Hang Seng Bank Ltd. This will result in the money entering the Hang Seng accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the private banking division. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of six {6} years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.=0A=C2=A0=0AWhat I wish to relate to you will smack off unethical practice but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with huge rewards for those who sit upon certain chairs and oversee certain portfolios.=0A=C2=A0=0AWhat I am saying in essence is that there is US$22,500,000.00 deposit just lying unclaimed. And all investigation by the bank to locate a next of kin has come to an end with no success.=0A=C2=A0=0ANow; I am prepared to furnish the necessary details to you as the closest surviving relation. I am also proposing that after successful execution of the business deal, the funds be disbursed in the ratio 30/70. 30% of the funds will go to you for offering yourself as the next of kin and providing a foreign account for safe transfer of the funds and 70% will be for me. Please let me know in your next correspondence if the above sharing ratio is okay by you.=0A=C2=A0=0AOnce more, I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail and forget I ever contacted you, I ask that you do not be vindictive and destructive; do not destroy my career. Such opportunities only come ones way once in a lifetime. I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities. I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank. If you give me positive signals, I will give you the relevant modus operandi to initiate this process towards a conclusion. Do not betray my confidence. I await your response.=0A=C2=A0=0ASincerely,=0A=C2=A0=0AMr. Vincent Chang
