Dear Sir!=0A=C2=A0=0AHow are you and your family doing?=0A=C2=A0=0AThank you very much my dear friend for your willingness to assist in this=0Atransaction. I need your assistance to enable us claim this amount $12.5Million=0Ainto your account by fronting for us as the "Appointed beneficiary or Next=0Aof Kin" of the original depositor of the fund who happens to share the=0Asame last name as you (Zeptowitz). It is only after the fund is transfer into your account=0Awith your assistance that we would go into viable investment, like buying of=0Aproperties and other profitable investments possibilities. It does not matter=0Aif you do not have an account with us (RHB Bank), and please let me assure you=0Athat this transaction is 100% legal and risk-free in its entire ramification.=0A=C2=A0=0AFirst, I must insist on your confidentiality in this transaction. I made this=0Acontact with you based on reliable information available to me courtesy of an=0Aagency that helps seek people by their email, and confirmed by my local=0Achambers of commerce and industry concerning your reputation. Thus I am=0Aconvinced you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money=0Atransfer transaction of US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million, Five Hundred Thousand=0AUnited States Dollars).=0A=C2=A0=0AIn 1996, my client was going through a horrendous divorce in the United Kingdom and was on the verge of losing most of his estate to his vicious and=0Adiabolical wife. As a result of this alarming predicament, my client came to me=0Awith a very brilliant idea. He transferred some funds, twelve million five=0Ahundred thousand dollars ($12.5Million) to a fixed deposit account in my bank=0Aunder an alias which only the two of us knew about as the confidentiality of=0Athe matter was necessary for his protection.=0A=C2=A0=0ADue to his untimely death in early 1997, the funds have been sitting in the=0Aaccount ever since and will continue to do so perpetually unless we do=0Asomething about it. This is where you come in. My client did not declare any=0A"Next of Kin or Appoints any beneficiary" in his official papers=0Aincluding the paper work of his bank deposit. Against this backdrop, my suggestion=0Ato you is that I would like you as a foreigner to stand as the "Next of=0AKin" to our client so that you will be able to receive his funds. I want=0Ayou to know that I have had everything planned out so that we can come out=0Asuccessful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary=0Adocument that will back you up as the "Next of Kin or Appointed=0Abeneficiary" to my client.=0A=C2=A0=0AWhat I need from you now:-=0Ai.=C2=A0Full names and address=0Aii. Company name (If any) and address=0Aiii. International Passport or ID=0A=C2=A0=0AAfter you have been made the "Next of Kin / Beneficiary", the=0Aattorney will also file-in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary=0Aapprovals and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an=0Aaccount that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the=0Amatter as we are going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare=0Aall the necessary documents. The allocation of our money will be as follows:=0A40% ($5Million) to you for your part in this, 60% (US$7.5Million) for me and my=0Acolleague. I think this is extremely fair, as you have nothing to lose but just=0Aa little time, while on the other hand I am staking my flawless reputation=0Aamong other things. And besides $5Million is no pocket change. Once you are=0Aapproved, the entire transaction should take no longer than twelve business=0Adays after which we will go about our daily business, but just millions of=0Adollars richer.=0A=C2=A0=0AAs you can see this is easier than taking candy from a baby, but mind you,=0ATRUST is something that is developed over time and that is something that we do=0Anot have. The money will be transferred to your account from our foreign=0Aclearance office in Europe. So please, there should be no room for GREED=0Abecause Twelve Million Five hundred thousand dollars can quench even the most=0Ainsatiable desire for the almighty dollar. In addition, I am going to be=0Aresponsible in paying the attorney fees to secure all documents that you will=0Arequire to make claim to the fund. Now, your responsibility is to travel to our=0Aforeign clearance office in either UK or Belgium to sign the final fund release=0Aorder documents. Here you must take care of the expenditures which include the=0Aminimum stamp duties fee to be paid for the release documents. All expenses=0Aspent by both parties would be deducted prior to sharing of fund?=0A=C2=A0=0AFurthermore, if you follow up this transaction diligently it would be completed=0Awithin 12 working days. What I expect from you is TRUST and COMMITMENT; I want=0Athis large sum of money transferred with your assistance.=0A=C2=A0=0AI want to know if you are willing to follow up this business seriously by=0Asending the aforementioned and I can give you more details about this=0Atransaction. I am forwarding you copy of my international passport as an=0Aattachment as a sign of my willingness to transact this mutual business=0Atransaction with you.=0A=C2=A0=0ARemember "Those who bring sunshine to other cannot keep it from=0Athemselves". I shall be waiting for your response and assurance.=0A=C2=A0=0ASincerely,=0AMrs. Waheeda B.B.Shaik Mohamed.=0ARHB Bank, Singapore=0A=0A=0A=0ANB: PLEASE CORRESPOND WITH THIS MY YAHOO EMAIL=E2=80=A6
