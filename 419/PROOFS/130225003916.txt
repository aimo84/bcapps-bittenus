Hello Friend =2C
I'm
 a Lawyer from Hong Kong. I work for an Iraqi high top personnel in=20
Iraqi North Oil Company in Iraq. My job takes me most times from Iraq to
 Turkey=2C Malaysia and China. My client in Iraq needs a Foreigner who can
 help assist in exporting 100=2C000 barrels of Light Crude Oil daily from=20
Kirkuk. This business is outside Iraqi North Oil Company's Knowledge. My
 client is able to get extra barrels of light crude oil which amounts to
 100=2C000 barrels through the means Iraqi North Oil Company gets theirs.
What
 we want is a foreigner that does not work with Iraqi North Oil Company=20
to run a Foreign Company we already set up in Iraq. This can be done=20
with ease with my assistance. I also want you to know that you really do
 not need to have any experience before you can partake in this=20
business.We
 have been doing this business with a Turkish man previously until he=20
recently got greedy and we cannot afford to loose more money to him as=20
we do not have any other choice as at then but working with you leaves=20
us with no choice than to stop working with him immediately. This is why
 we need another foreign partner like you that will assist us without=20
greed and that would be truthful.There
 is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt a=20
legalized method and I have documentations backing up this company set=20
up for this exportation purpose. Please endeavour to observe utmost=20
discretion in all matters concerning this issue. I need to know if you=20
can handle this business with us?Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.
