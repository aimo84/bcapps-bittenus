Dear: Leonard Zeptowitz

This is a life time opportunity and 100% legitimate. Violet my wife
and I have decided to make sure this is put on the internet for the
world to see. My wife has cancer and as you could see from the
webpage, am not getting any younger and you can imagine having no kids
at this age. You see after taken care of the needs of our immediate
family members, we decided to donate the remaining of the $11 Million
to other individuals around the world in need, the local fire
department, the Red Cross, Haiti, hospitals in Truro where Violet
underwent her cancer treatment, and some other organizations in Asia
and Europe that fight cancer, Alzheimer's and diabetes and the bulk of
the funds deposited with the disbursement officer, the delivery
company of this charity donation scheme. We have kept just 2% of the
entire lottery sum to ourselves for the raining day.

] which have been donated solely to you, please send us the following

the money wisely and judiciously over there in your country. We will
employ you to do what you can to alleviate the level of poverty in
your region and also try to enhance the standard of living of as many
people as you can because that is the only objective of donating this
