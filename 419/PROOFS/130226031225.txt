Dear Leonard Zeptowitz
=0A=C2=A0
=0AThanks for your response to my invitational business proposal, I want to=0A assure you that you will not have any cause to regret this bold step =0Athat you have taken.As I have clearly stated in my first mail to you, =0Athe money(USD36.5M) in question resulted form an over invoiced contract =0Asum that has been executed and completed,the original contractor has =0Abeen paid but the excess money now lies in the escrow account of the =0Aapex bank of Nigeria.
=0A=C2=A0
=0ATo get this money out, we need the services of a foreigner whose =0Ainformation we shall use to apply for the release of this fund through =0Athe Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas Company=C2=A0 where the contract was =0Aawarded,we are serving civilian still in active service and as such can =0Anot operate or own a foreign account while still in service hence our =0Acontacting you.Your role is to provide the foreign account where this =0Amoney will be remitted into, once we have this, then a formal =0Aapplication will be made on your behalf to the NLNG so that we can get =0Aapprovals for the remittance of the money through our Apex bank.
=0A=C2=A0
=0AThis whole process should not take more than 14 work days from the date =0Athe application is submitted,having said all these, I will appreciate it=0A if you send the following requirements so that we can file in the =0Aapplication for claim in your favour,I want you to be rest assured that I=0A and my colleagues will do all within our powers to protect you by =0Aproviding all documentary evidence that will back your claim on demand =0Aby the appropriate authorities in Nigeria.
=0A=C2=A0
=0A1)YOUR FULL NAMES AND ADDRESS.
=0A2)COMPANY NAME AND ADDRESS IF ANY.
=0A3)TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.
=0A4)YOUR COMPLETE BANKING CO-ORDINATES WITH ADDRESS
=0A5)A COPY OF ANY MEANS OF IDENTIFYING YOU.
=0A=C2=A0
=0AA soon as I receive this, a company will be open in your favour because =0Awithout you having a company it will be practically impossible to get =0Athe money.
=0A=C2=A0
=0AThis is a genuine business and for every good business, you must have to=0A invest in some way, with that in mind we have set aside some reasonable=0A amount of money that we feel should be enough for this transaction, so =0Afor now your role will be to provide the needed information while we =0Atake care of things here and if the need for us to spend additional =0Afunds arise and your attention needed we shall call on you as partners.
=0A=C2=A0
=0AHonestly I cannot say that you will not be asked to assist financially =0Abut for now we have enough and every money spent will be well documented=0A because what ever you put in financially will be paid back before the =0Aprincipal sum is shared on the ratio that has to be agreed by all =0Aparties involved.
=0A=C2=A0
=0ASo my friend you are not under any obligation to continue if you feel =0Athat you are not up to it.You can give me your final answer and whatever=0A it will be I will respect you for that.
=0AThis is just a concise process of the project so if you are still =0Ainterested, then get me the required information and there is also need =0Afor continuous verbal communication between us.
=0A=C2=A0
=0AThanks once more while I await your response with the=C2=A0 required =0Ainformation.If there is anything that is not clear to you then feel free=0A to call me or email.
=0A=C2=A0
=0ARegards,
=0AGeorge Ochuko
