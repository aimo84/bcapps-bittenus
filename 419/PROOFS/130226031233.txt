Secondly i want you to know that you need to confide in =0Ame so that you can be able to remit your long awaited payment at our =0Acustody as the United Nation who issued to you these payment as given to=0A us here at the Zenith Bank Plc a mandate to any beneficiary who is =0Awilling to receive his/her payment sum of US$1.5Million dollars must however reconfirm=C2=A0 the required information=0A below:

Below are the three different ways in which you can receive your payment:

(1) Through courier deliver - by paying for the little delivery cost
(2) Through Bank Transfer - paying for the Cost of Transfer (C.O.T)
(3) Through Automated Teller Machine (ATM) card - by paying for the packaging and delivery of your payment via ATM Card.

You=0A can track the below tracking number of beneficiaries like you that have=0A received their payment from different countries without any=0A interference.

DHL website: www.dhl.com

Mr. Barry Ziegler (USA) tracking number-1059842464 .

Mr. Yongjoong Seo (South Korea) tracking number-1222945205

UPS Website: www.ups.com

Mr. Ahmed (Saudi Arabia) tracking number-H8445958432

Mr. Kyung Ki Do (South Korea) KR tracking number-H8638124066

Keith Calihoo (Canada) tracking number-H8438011173

Mr. Earle Well (New Zealand) tracking number - H7910133184

Nia Fakour (United Arab Emirates) tracking number - H7909653802

Ben Klodewjik (Belgium) tracking number - H8438011280

Our=0A agreement with the United Nations is to pay over 25 people and what =0Athey wanted was for these whole 25 people to come down here to Africa =0Aand receive their payments themselves, then we thought of a better and =0Afaster solution which is to send the bank draft only if the beneficiary =0Ainvolved is ready to take care of the fees involved.

But in the=0A issue of the beneficiary not having the funds or unable to bear the =0Alittle fees involved, I must let you know that there is no way you can =0Areceive your payment without meeting this necessary requirement, also =0Ayou have every right to accept or reject your payment if it will do you =0Aany good or harm as I am not interested in your pocket.

Have in =0Amind that it is not the in tension of the UN organization for you to pay=0A any fees only that I thought it would be easier to send your payment =0Aoff instead of you flying all the way to Africa to receive your payment,=0A but if that is what you want fine, if not we will go to different =0Acourier service offices and contact with the payment transfer units dept=0A to know what each of them will cost you.
