Dear  Leonard Zeptowitz,

This is Mr. Mark Taylor.  Thanks very much for your prompt reply to my
proposal. I want you to know that I decided to contact you believing that
by the grace of God,  you will not disappoint me at the successful
conclusion of this deal especially when the funds should have been
transferred into your designated bank account in your country. This is a
life time opportunity that comes only but once. It is one of the means by
which bankers make fortune .  I personally used my office as The Bill and
Exchange Manager of my Bank to aid Late Khamis Gaddafi, the youngest son of
Muammar Gaddafi when he deposited this funds(US$25,500,000.00) TWENTY
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS in my bank since 2009 without any
next of Kin and unfortunately, he was killed on 29 August 2011 during Libya
revolution. So,I contacted you because I know that the fund shall go a long
way in assisting us in life , even for the sake of our children future
instead of losing the funds to the bank treasury on "no claimant" basis.

Nevertheless, I want to assure you that this transaction is genuine and
shall be executed successfully utilizing my position in the bank.

that you will be honest to return my share of the funds which you will also
assist me to invest in real estate/ property in your country after
deducting your 30% share of the funds as agreed.

The only thing we have to do in this transaction is to procure a legal
document(affidavit) on your name that will cover you legally as the
beneficiary of this funds.
As soon as  your name has been entered in the database of the bank as the
beneficiary of this funds of which I shall ensure, I will advise you how to
contact my bank for approval and transfer of this funds into your nominated
bank account.

You must forward the below listed information to me immediately so that i
can proceed in procuring the legal documents on your name as the bonafide
beneficiary of the fund and for transfer of the fund into your nominated
bank account without further delay.

1, Your full name and address
2, Your private telephone and fax number for easier communication
3, Your marital status and age.
4.  Profession

I`m waiting for your urgent response so I will proceed without delay in
