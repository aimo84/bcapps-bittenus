Hello Leonard,

Thanks so much for your response.

I would prefer if we talk this matter over on the phone, however, I request
that you go through the details below for a better understanding of this
possible joint venture.

My mail to you was written as a matter of last resort because of the
circumstances surrounding this claim. Mr. Dickson Zeptowitz was an oil
merchant and he had oil dealings around Europe. He died in 2004 at 54,
alongside his wife, Maria, 46, and their only daughter, Katharina, 11.

I am not too sure you are actually related to this person because we have
since carried out a search on his actual extended family ties and which
efforts have been to no avail and hence my contacting you. I had contacted
you to solicit your honest assistance in re-profiling funds belonging to my
late client. I want you to consider the details so you could understand the
fuller reasons I need your co-operation.

Mr. Dickson Zeptowitz lived most of his years here in UNITED KINGDOM. I
served as his private attorney for the last eight years preceding his death
and I had known the family a little while before then. Mr. Dickson migrated
into LONDON a long time ago as an orphan. I never knew his father but I
knew him to be the Late Mr. Antonio who died in Belgium.

I contacted you because after the death of my late client, I was informed
by the Bank to search for any member of his extended family (related
especially consanguinally), to put up a claim, or who could be so
represented as managers or trustees for his deposited funds with them which
stands at over 30 Million Pounds due to the fact that he died with his
immediate family members.

After preliminary efforts of search which came to no avail, we were given
an ultimatum at the beginning of the New Year to look for some one to come
for the claim or have the funds liquidated and made unserviceable in
accordance with existing laws because it will be assumed that no member of
his family is alive. However, it might interest you to know that, after a
thorough investigation in the Bank, I found out that some members of the
company are currently planning to divert this fund in their selfish
interest and only want to use the excuse that since I am not able to look
for someone to make the claim, the money should be made unserviceable and
that means reverting the fund to the Government while the company retains a
percentage of it. After their plans and professional consideration on my
part, I decided to look for someone credible, with the same last name with
my late client, to apply for this claim due to the fact that I have at my
possession some legal documents which are very important and which might be
requested by them and which, can only be provided by my chambers since they
have since been with us.

I feel and know that you will be able to make this claim successfully
because of your rare last name which is the same as that of my late
client's and as a result of this I do not want the Bank to be aware that I
contacted you first in order to prevent them from going into much
investigations on whom you actually are and that can put the success of
this transaction on the line. I want you to be rest assured that this is
legal with no risk involved, since all the legal documents that gives you
the right to make the claim is available. This is a deal I am offering you
and I want you to know that it requires only a mature mind to understand
all I am saying and I believe you are mature enough which is the reason I
am going further.

I am taking my time to explain all these to you now because I want you to
see the reasons why my name should not be mentioned any time you are
discussing with the members of the Bank and why this transaction has to be
kept really confidential in order for us to be able to achieve our goals
neatly.

NOTE that if they request to know how you came to know that your family
member (Dickson) had such an amount of funds with them and who contacted
you, which I am not sure they will ask, but in order to be on the safer
side, if you are asked, be confident to tell them that the extended family
discovered some documents in his archives showing that Mr. Dickson
Zeptowitz lodged such funds with them and that is why you have been sent by
the paternal family to contact the bank. Anyway, further deliberations will
be held on this as we proceed.

I want you to know that I have these documents as well as the death
certificate of Mr. Dickson Zeptowitz to show you as proof and I will
release them to you as soon as I have attained your confidence, maybe after
we speak on phone. I will also provide you with any information you need as
we proceed.

Please bear in mind that you have to be really sure if you are going ahead
or not for I do not want to jeopardize the success of this transaction
which means so much to me at the moment. I will wait for your response and
please do not forget about the discreet nature of this transaction.

Send your direct telephone number along with your complete details to me so
that I can call you or call me on my direct telephone number.

Best regards,

Jonathan Angell
