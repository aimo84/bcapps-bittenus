My Dear Friend,

Thanks for your response , I will have to explain the details of the transaction to your understanding before we take further actions. You have to trust me because without trust in a business of this nature we can't succeed.
=20
I work with African Private Bank here in South Africa. We had a client named MR. Brian Stugart from Munich , Germany . He was a contractor and a property magnate. I was directly assigned to him as his relationship manager/financial adviser. He made several deposits (fixed) with African Private Bank group amounting to $15.5 million  Upon maturity, several notices were sent to him but we never got a response until we discovered that he died along with his entire immediate family members in an air crash in the year 2003.Since then nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this money because to the best of my knowledge apart from his wife (Now late too) no other family member who is aware of the existence of neither the account nor the funds. As his relationship manager every of the activities regarding the locating of the possible next of kin revolves round my desk. I therefore decided to look for a reliable foreign partner to work with since our banking regulation requires that unclaimed funds after a period of Ten (10) Years will be paid into the states reserve and forfeited to Government.

Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that i would like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to the late Brian Stugart so you will be able to receive his funds. ALL MODALITIES HAS BEEN WORKED OUT FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSACTION!! The Strategy is to use my influence as the relationship manager/financial adviser in the bank to approve the funds in your name as the beneficiary of the fund. I have contacts in the South African department of Justice who can facilitate preparation of necessary legal documents that will back you up as the next of kin to Mr. Brian Stugart. So that should not be a source of concern to you.

I am willing to give you 40%. Please if you are interested let me know immediately so that my contact who will handle the title documents can commence his job.=20
We shall use your full names to be used preparing the Documents and your contact address. As soon as this is done a letter of Administration will be issued in your favor for making you the Administrator of the late Mr. Brian stugart's Estate and with this you can make application for the release of the funds. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going to adopt legal methods in applying for the release of the funds to you. Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue as you know envy people will jeopardize our efforts if they know about this.

Let have your phone number so I can call you for us to discuss more details and commence..

You can call me on the number below.

Kind Regards,
Mr. Martins Banda
