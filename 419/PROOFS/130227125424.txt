Hello,
Thank you for your response, to kick start the process of the funds claim officially, we will need to secure legal probate documents as I have already told you in my previous email to you.
These legal probate documents are the documents that will be used to prove and confirm your ownership and beneficiary status of the funds before the asset claim, confiscation and forfeiture committee of my bank. Because of this, I have already by yesterday sourced for and was lucky to find a lawyer who agreed to handle the drafting and production of the legal probate documents from the probate court here in Japan. I had concluded all discussions with him, based on the positive response I received from you. He accepted to do the job for us at very high cost though which I am going to take care from my side.
His job description is as stated; to prepare legal probate documents that will state you as the beneficiary of the said asset (inheritance funds) in its true deposit value. The cash transfer will be made to you directly in strict compliance with and through authorized payment channels as aptly described in the Asset Payment guidelines of the Bank and Financial Institutions Act of 2005 of Tokyo Monetary Authority. (T.M.A).
I am meeting with the lawyer later tomorrow to fine tune and finalize plans on ALL and other sundry matter concerning the legal documents and to know what documents he would be producing so I know what to expect from his end. Meanwhile, I need the following information from you for the proper paper work and filing/records titling at the office, as I am also sure the lawyer would also need the information too to enable him accomplish his task of the legal documents. 
Your Full Names:Profession:Your Address:Age:Personal/Private Phone/Marital status:
Please do oblige me with the required details immediately. So I can engage the lawyer to commence action without further delays.
With the assurances of my warmest regards as always.
Mr. Joseph Liang Li
