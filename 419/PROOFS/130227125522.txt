From Miss Mariana Yama.
=C2=A0
Dearest One,
=C2=A0
Good day and how do you do? I hope fine.
=C2=A0
I am very happy to receive your message. Thank you for honest sincere to help me which I do not know how to thank you.I am contacting you from Abidjan Cote D=E2=80=99Ivoire, West Africa.Cote D=E2=80=99Ivoire is a small Christian and island colonized by French colony.

I speak English and French fluently. I am 20 years old not married. I dropped my education after the death of my parents and which I would like to continue in your country upon my arrival.
=C2=A0
However, as I explained in my proposal, the fund is presently kept in a consignment deposited in a private Storage Firm here in Abidjan Cote D=E2=80=99Ivoire. We definitely need to retrieve the consignment and transfer the fund to your nominated account or any account you open in respect of this transaction.

For you to help me we have two available options that will enable you to help me and you have to chose one of it.
=C2=A0
1. You have to come down here so both of us will go and retrieve the consignment at the Storage Firm where it was deposited and transfer the fund to your account and then go back same time to your country but is not advisable to ask you to come here of Security reasons as we are just coming of from civil war.
=C2=A0
2.The Storage Firm can also ship the consignment to you in your country through there Diplomatic Immunity means of delivering with a very good mutual agreement if you cannot be able to come here.
=C2=A0
It will please me for you come down here so that we will see face to face and conclude this transaction with storage firm but as I said is because of trust and also for you to witness the consignment in the Storage Firm before you help me to retrieve it but if you give me the trust and proceed with the Storage Firm to deliver the consignment to you in your country and I believe is also same thing when you come here.

I agreed to give you 15% of the total fund for any assistance you renders in this affair and also map out another 3% for any expense you might made as a result of telephone bills or your traveling expense down here, etc.
=C2=A0
But, the most important thing is, I would like to know more about your business potentials. In a business of this nature, you will always bear in mind that , the fact that, both of us have not met nor knew ourselves before, will make things a bit difficult for us to work as one mind and body. I am seriously disturbed about this because it may make mutual understanding between two of us to be difficult. =C2=A0
=C2=A0
But we can trust ourselves since we are total stranger to each other, we can cooperate effectively, I have the confidence to release the fund to you.
=C2=A0
Without knowing more about, I will need assurance from you that you will only do as both of us has agreed to do, that you will=C2=A0 NOT/NEVER=C2=A0 betray me in this endeavor, and help me in
getting me a good school for the continuity of my educational career which was disrupted by the sudden death of my parents .
=C2=A0
I am about to release a huge sum to you and you must understand there is need for you to send me some assurances; this is why I need your photo or formal identity too. However, I send you mine.
