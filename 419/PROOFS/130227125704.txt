with love and care i say a big 
thanks for your kindness and understanding. Because not everyone can 
reason the way you did and i promise that you will never ever regret 
this rather we shall thank God together for bring us together because 
this fund is going to change my life and yours for better.

first you have to be know in the bank as my late fathers partner and 
beneficiary of the fund and that i will be the person to do that since i am the next of kin. and to get that done you have to send such details 
to me.
your full name, your telephone number and your address, not forgeting your age.

once i receive this details i will go to the bank and submit it as beneficiary of the money and the bank will in return give their bank contact details and i will 
send it to you and instruct you on what to do so that they can start on 
the process for the fund transfer. I am willing to give you 12% of the 
total sum once you where able to help me out as you have promise and not only that. you will promise me that you will be there to help me invest this money in any business that you know too well as i do not know much about investing in business.
i wait to read from you so that i will show you the documents that proof 
what i have told you and other details of the bank where you can check 
on the fund online to see the true position of the money there via 
online banking.
regards
Rose
