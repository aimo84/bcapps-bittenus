It was unfortunate that he died before his contract payment was approved in February 2004. Since then, all efforts to locate any of his relatives proved unsuccessful till date.

There is a provision in the Payment Receiving File (PRF) where every contractor supposed to file his next of kin or business partner. Here it happened that Mr. John Bernstrom did not fill the column so the payment has no registered next of kin or business partner and now has an open beneficiary mandate for me to fill in your information/details since I am the person that has true information about the contract supply or the deceased.=0A=A0=0APROCEDURE:=0AI will use your=A0 name=A0 and details to update the Payment Receiving File (PRF) of Late John Bernstrom in your favor as the deceased business partner.
