*FROM MRS.SUSAN SHABANGU  *
*MINISTER OF MINING*
*OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA*
*TELE: +27-83-686-2613.

*
* Dear:*
* *
*Compliments of the day to you, with due respect, trust and humility, I
write to you this proposal.*
* *
*First, let me start by introducing myself as MRS SUSAN SHABANGU, a mother
of three children and the Minister of Mining of the Republic of South
Africa since May 2009. To date under the auspices of the President of South
Africa MR JACOB ZUMA. After due deliberation with my children, I decided to
contact you for your assistance in standing as a beneficiary to the sum of
US$30.5M (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only)
You can view my profile at my (website by clicking (
www.info.gov.za/gol/gcis_profile.jsp?id=1066 ) and read about me. THE
PROPOSAL, After the swearing in ceremony making me the Minister of Mining,
my husband Mr. Ndebele Shabangu died while he was on an official trip to
Trinidad and Tobago in 2009.After his death, I discovered that he had some
funds in a dollar account which amounted to the sum of US$30.5M with a
security and finance institution here in South Africa of which I will
divulge information to you when I get your full consent and support to go
for a change of beneficiary and subsequent transfer of the funds into your
comfortable and conducive account of your choice. *
* *
*This fund emanated as a result of an over-invoiced contract which he
executed with the Government of South Africa . Though I assisted him in
getting this contract but I never knew that it was over-invoiced by him. I
am afraid that the government of South Africa might start to investigate on
contracts awarded from 2006 to date.*
* *
*If they discover this money in his bank account, they will confiscate it
and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will definitely affect
my political career in government. I want your assistance in opening an
account with bank through my lawyer so that this fund could be wired into
your account directly without any hitch.*
* *
*I am offering you 20% of the principal sum which amounts to
US$6,100.000.00 (Six million One Hundred Thousand United States Dollars
Only) and 5% will be for any expenses that both of us may Insure in this
transaction. And another 5% will go for Motherless babes home. Wherever,
you have to assure me and also be ready to go into agreement with me that
you will not elope with my fund. If you agree to my terms, kindly as a
matter of urgency send me an email. (**s.shabangu31@yahoo.co.za*) if you
want to speak with my lawyer that promises to help move this fund out of
South Africa to your account, that is fine and okay by me. Or any time you
want to speak with me then I will give you my private numbers so that we
can talk more about the transfer, Please I do not need to remind you of the
need for absolute Confidentiality of this transaction.**
* *
*My regards to your family,*
* *
*Yours faithfully,*
*MRS. SUSAN SHABANGU.*
*Minister of Mining of the Republic of South Africa since May 2009*
*My private e mail address, **s.shabangu31@yahoo.co.za
