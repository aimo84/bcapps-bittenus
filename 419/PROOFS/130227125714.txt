Dear Friend=2C

I thank you very much for your response to my proposal.We carried out a transaction in crude oil from my country and the money was to be payed to me through a domicilary account outside my country Russia=2C which we don=2Ct have the facility because we are being forbidden to have any offshore account outside my country since we are still ligitimate workers of Rosneftoil. so i have to look for someone who is trust worthy to assist in the collection of the funds from Tilitytrust&diplomatic security services Netherlands.

So i will greatly appreciate your assistance and kind jesture in
carrying out this transaction. I hope you are realiable and trust
worthy as more payments will be made through you. if so kindly send to me your personal information about your self=2Cie=2C

2. your Contact Address.
3. your Tel/Fax numbers.
