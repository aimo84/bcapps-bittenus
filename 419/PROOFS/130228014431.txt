Hello Dear,

I have just received your email with lots of excitement, because when
I sent the letter to you my heart has been over occupied with thoughts
and fear if my situation will touch your Heart to come for my rescue,
Firstly, I am emailing you from the office of the Rev . Father in
Evangelical Lurtheran Church refugee Mission Camp, I told the
Rev.Father Benjamin about my communication with you and he permitted
me to access my email in his office computer twice a day,

Presently I have no phone but if you want to hear my voice you can
call me with the office number of the rev father +226 752 797 95 here
in the refugees camp and ask of Miss Peace that stays in the Female
Hostel Room 12, Block c when you will call me. Life here in the
Refugee camp is very difficult for me, I cannot eat three times a day,
I am really suffering here, it makes me cry each day and night when i
look at my condition here, but I know that with you i will soon come
out from this my present condition and have a new life with you,

I have been in the bank for several times and I was informed by the
director of the bank that before this fund will be release I must have
to present a reliable Person that would stand on behalf of me as my
Trustee. Because of my refugee status i have no previlage to make any
claim of my own without you. I have already made up my mind to come
over to your country since you have equally decided to help me. I pray
that God will give you the courage and the heart to help me with all
sincerity.

Concerning the documentations, I have the last State of Account, a
copy of my late father's Will and a Death Certificate which I have
presented before the Bank Director and i am assuring you it is not
going to involve any problem now or future since i have all the
approved documents to back up the transaction. After the transaction
has been completed, I am promising and ready to offer you 35% of the
total fund for your assistance . Please all i need from you is to take
this transaction serious.

 About my Education, I was admitted in the University when my late
father was still alife and I did my one year subject in Medicine
before his Death , and I would like to continue my studies as soon as
i relocate to your country, because this is a promise i made to my
father,

So dear, I need your information below, which I will include in the
letter of authorization to the bank so that you can send it to bank
with your application as well, as my trustee.

Full Name,................
Address ..................
Occupation ...............
Telephone Number,
Age.......................
Your Photograph.........
Country...................

I am waiting for these information so that I will send the letter to
the bank, and please remember that you should keep this transaction
only to yourself till the money has been transferred, I do not want
anyone to know about it, you know that they are so many wicked and bad
people in the world that when they see good thing coming to you and
they will stop it, and i want to keep my evil step Mother and Uncle
unaware until i relocate to your country because they threaten to kill
me, I am a living witness, so promise me that you will keep it to
yourself so that the whole transfer will be O.K. also need your
picture so that I will know what you look like.

Attach is my picture and national id card. When i receive your
information  i will send you all the documentation proof with bank
contact details.

Best regards. Miss Peace
