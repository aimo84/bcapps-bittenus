Dear friend Leonard Zeptowitz,
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
Greetings to you and your entire =0Afamily, I am happy to receive your mail content well understood and now I=0A have more confidence in you that you cannot cheat me or sit on this =0Afund when it is transferred into your account, how is your family? I =0Ahope every body is fine. May the Almighty God bless you for the interest=0A you have invested to help me realize transaction for us to share this =0Afund.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
Please my good friend, it is true that we don=E2=80=99t know =0Aeach other, but as long as we serve one Allah, i solicit for your =0Aconfidence and trust to enable us mutually undertake this prospects and I=0A will come to your country when this fund has been delivered in to your =0Aaccount because I have to be here to make sure that I direct you on what=0A to do until this fund is approved and to avoid any error from your =0Aside.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
I would like you to send me your picture for more =0Arecognition hence you and myself are to work together as one team to =0Ainherit this fund into your account.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
And for your information, the deceased account holder with our bank was Mr. Andreas Schranner from Germany.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
He=0A held account number N=C2=B0:14-2558-5976, with our bank. He died on 26th =0ADecember 2004 with his family but since his death, this account has been=0A dormant in our bank and no body has applied to our bank for the release=0A of this money to him or her as the next of kin. So I want you to =0Aarrange for a good receiving bank account into which our bank shall =0Atransfer this money in your favour as next of kin and you have nothing =0Ato fear since I am here give you all the developmental information=E2=80=99s to =0Amake sure the fund is transferred to your account without delays.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
Meanwhile,=0A there is no doubt about your eligibility as the legal next of kin to =0Aour deceased customer and Beneficiary to the fund owner of the account =0Anumber N=C2=B0:14-2558-5976=C2=A0 with the following reasons:
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
(1.) =0ABefore the death of our deceased customer, his true next of kin was not =0Aindicated to the board of directors of the bank because of the top =0Asecrecy and confidentiality of the business which our late customer =0Atransacted with the various governments in West Africa .
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
(2.)=0A Owning to his failure to indicate his next of kin to the officials of =0Athe bank, it is therefore impossible for the board of directors of the =0Abank to verify the next of kin.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
(3.) The deceased late Mr. =0AAndreas Schranner did not have any relationships with our bank; he was =0Aonly a customer to our bank, So there is no trace either now or in =0Afuture because the bank is not aware that our deceased customer died =0Aalong with his entire family and supposed next of kin.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
(4.) =0ATherefore the managements of the bank that authorized me officially as =0Athe Bill and exchange manager of the bank to verify the next of kin to =0Aour deceased customer.so I believe the bank will always abide by my =0Aofficial directions through the official authorization bestowed on me. =0AAnd for this reasons you have nothing to fear as your interest and =0Aidentity will be legally protected.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
Therefore, I will advice =0Ayou to hurry up and fill the below application form with your banking =0Ainformation=E2=80=99s with your personal data=E2=80=99s and send it to the management of=0A my bank customers email address=C2=A0=C2=A0 ( bankofafrica.online@postafiok.hu ) =0Aas the next of kin to the deceased customer and please inform after =0Asending the application so that I can be monitoring everything and make =0Asure your application is given an urgent attention, so that the bank can=0A commence on the transfer process while I am here to guard and direct =0Ayou on what to do until this fund is transferred in to your account.
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=20
I=0A am working in the same bank for over thirteen years now and I have all =0Athe informations about the deceased customer so if you receive any mail =0Afrom the bank do not reply the bank until you inform me so that I can =0Adirect you on what to do to avoid any error from your side in this =0Atransaction and make sure you don=E2=80=99t let the management of my bank to =0Aknow about my involvement in this transaction, just keep every thing =0Aabout this transaction confidentially until the funds enters into your =0Abank account before my coming to your country for my own share of the =0Afund ok.
