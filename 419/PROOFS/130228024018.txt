Dear One,

Thanks for your kind response, and your desire to assist me in this venture, well i am not afraid of death because i know where i am heading to, my only problem is to see the desire of my late husband come to accomplishment now that i am alive, but i want you to assure me that you will never let down the trust i have put on you as to use this fund accordingly.

Please, I want you to understand that this transaction is in fulfillment of the desire and decision of my late husband which I am persuaded to actualize, Meanwhile, I could have donate this fund here in my country,
but the reason is that before the death of my late husband he warned me not to let his relatives know about this fund because they contributed in his death and i don't intend to disobey him even in death.

I am very sincere and humble Woman, i decided to contact you because i believed that you are a sincere person who will assist me in this transaction, And i have discussed with the director of the Bank as to know the best way to send this fund to you, the director told me that they need your full bank account informations were the bank will transfer the fund to you. such as; bank name and address, bank account number, swift code, name of beneficiary etc.

Most Important: I will like this to be so confidential and sincerely, also bear in mind that i can not call you on phone, all our communication will be via-email because this sickness has touched and made it difficult for me to hear well as concerns telephone.
