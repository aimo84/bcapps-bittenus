I want you to know that the funds is presently in a bank in Ghana,
awaiting proper processing into the banking system. So at this
juncture, we need to meet in Ghana to discuss and move the funds
thereafter. So let me know if you can fly down there within the
shortest possible time? The earlier the better.

In the meanwhile if you will be coming down, there is a need for you
to send some vital information with which we would commence
formalization process even ahead of your touch down.
I shall await your response as soon as possible.

Mohammed Roman
