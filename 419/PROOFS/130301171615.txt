Greetings
Thanks for your prompt response, this is my number: +44 793 701 7916 and
attached is my ID.

Clients that patronize us, mostly high net worth individuals, want their
account to remain anonymous for tax purpose, creditors obligation, alimony
and child support payment. The accounts are assigned digitally generated
random numbers, their correspondence with the bank, both snail and
electronic mail are not sent to postal address but stored on encrypted
server at the bank office. They also leave testament with the bank about
how their investment should be deposed, in case of death.

The client in question did not leave detailed instruction on how his
investment should be disposed, this is the opportunity we seeking to
exploit. My access to privilege information will make it possible for us to
successfully apply to claim the funds =A318.7M (shared 50% for me, 40% for
you and 10% should be for tax as your government may require),  please
furnish me with your background information (name,age,address,occupation,
telephone and fax) for easy and effective communication

Don't worry just follow my instructions and everything will be fine.

Regards
Harry Cole
