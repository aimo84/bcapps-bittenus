Dear Beloved
I am most grateful for your mail, and I seize this opportunity to thank you
for coming to my rescue. However i crave your indulgence to kindly attend
to this in good faith as everything is Legal and the funds belongs to my
Late husband whom before his death was always helping Charitable
organization,Churches and NGO in the world. I hope you were not too
embarrassed by my first email to you since you do not know me, I had no
option since the family of my husband in and outside Russia refused to
distribute my husband funds because they wanted to keep it to them selves.
I don't really know how to move the funds out and dispatched it to charity
organizations, so I resulted to putting fate to test and making a random
contact, I got your email address from a private search which i did on the
Internet.I am communicating with only you at this moment with regards to
this transaction. And I would not have any cause to do otherwise, except
you state your intention to withdraw your assistance.The fund is presently
with a bank in MALAYSIA and the amount is 7.5 Million Pounds and they would
be able to transfer the funds to you immediately if you adhere strictly to
their directive.I cannot distribute these funds myself because of the
following reasons:
(1) I am undergoing medical treatment and It has defiled all forms of
medicine, and right now I have only about a few Months to live, according
to medical expert's diagnosis.

(2) I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so, I have
decided to give help to charity organizations, churches and NGO, as I want
this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth before my death. It is
for this reasons I am seeking for your assistance to stand as the
beneficiary to the fund and retrieve it on my behalf and dispatched it to
charity organizations.I will be sending to you some names of these
organizations too.
All the necessary documents required to get the Funds out of the bank are
with me.However, before I proceed further in giving you the Bank contact, I
want you to give me your words that you will be very honest and straight
forward with me when the money gets to you and also that you will be able
to execute this Project successfully and help me dispatched it to charity
organizations.As this is MY LAST WISH BEFORE MY DEATH TO SEE ME CONCLUDE
THIS.
Thus, I would want you to get back to me on the following issues if you are
ready to assist me:
(1) That you are in a position to be trusted as a God fearing person with
such a large amount of fund been entrusted to you. Also, that you will
dispatch it to charity organization and churches as I wanted it.
(2) That you are willing to contact the Bank to discuss the terms of
activating the dormant account and releasing the funds to you.As soon as I
receive your reply that you are ready to proceed under these terms, then I
will furnish you with all details including the Bank Name. But if you have
any questions to ask me, please ask and I will be more than happy to
respond to them immediately.
I will be sending to you all the necessary documentations to conclude this
Project.
Looking forward for your reply. Remain bless. Mrs. Mary Parker.
