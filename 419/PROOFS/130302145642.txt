Dear Partner,

I
 received your email and will like to assure you once more that this 
transaction is 100% risk free as we are going to follow the legal 
procedure to get your name as the legal beneficiary to the funds.

You

 should not entertain any atom of fear because I am here to feed you 
with the whole information that might be required during the period of 
this transaction, in as much as you obey my instructions success will be
 ours sooner than your expectations.

I contacted you in this 
transaction on my search for a reliable partner and my secretary, 
Miss.Megg gave me your contact and I am sure she got it from the 
computer. I have not seen you before but my mind tells me that you will 
not betray me in this transaction that's the simply reason why I 
contacted you. I contacted you because I cannot make this claim alone 
except with
 you a foreigner because the original owner of the account is a 
foreigner and the money is also in foreign currency.
.

The 
deceased, Late Mr.George Small, Until his death was the Manager of 
GEORGE COY [pty]BF. He held this account with a prime bank here in 
Burkina Faso where I work as an auditor.

During our auditing in 
the bank, I discovered that the account has been dormant and the bank 
recommended that after this fiscal year, the fund will be transferred to
 the apex bank as unclaimed bills and this warranted my search for a 
honest person who will apply for the fund and claim it so that we share 
it together as I indicated in my previous mail. I have worked here in 
the bank for a period of time now without achieving anything that is why
 when I saw this opportunity, I decided to utilize it. You have no much 
duty to do as I will be directing you appropriately in every step to 
enable us have a successful completion.

I am just an
 average civil servant here in the bank and wouldn't like to miss this 
Golden opportunity before me I want you to tell me more about your 
status because I am beginning to take you like a partner that is why I 
would like you to do your best and call me once you receive this mail so
 that we talk to each other for better understanding.
You will be 
required to be here once approval is granted in your name to endorse the
 Change of Beneficiary Form with the ministry of finance. Please you 
have to try your possible best on this as that will be a very big 
opportunity for us to know each other and build more confidence.

I
 have given you a vivid account of all that is involved and think you 
are supposed to declare your stand to me to enable me know which steps 
to take because this is an opportunity I can not let go. I want you to 
know that this transaction is going to join our families together 
because I will quit my job after the money has been
 successfully transferred to your account and I make sure I delete all 
necessary information regarding this transaction in the banks file.

If this deal further interest you then you reply me immediately to enable us proceed.

If
 you will not partake, kindly discard this information and never expose 
it to any person due the sensitivity of the transaction.

I have 
decided to offer you 40% of the total sum for your help and assistance. I
 have mapped out 5% of the sum for expenses and taxes and the remaining 
balance will be invested in Real Estate business in the your country 
through your help. However, let me assure you once again that this 
transaction is not a money laundry and I have made strigents efforts to 
locate our clients relatives without success hence my contact with you 
because if I as a director of the bank fail to provide my client next of
 kin the authorities will confiscate the funds as an unclaimed funds.

Please

 could you give me a confirmation that you are satisfied with the 
percentage I have offered and you are willing to commit yourself to this
 project putting God first as our guide and guard. Please do not fail to
 provide the requested information.This is my private number 
00226-660-237-59.

(1) Your name and address for us to
move forward.

(2) Your personal
phone and fax numbers and your occupation.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Regards,

Mr Hamza Kabore.
