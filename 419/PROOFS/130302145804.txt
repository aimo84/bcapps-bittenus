Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,

Greetings to you, and thank you very much for your response to my proposal.
I got your contact when I was looking for someone who shares the same
surname with my late client. First of all I want to assure you that what I
have brought before you is clear as daylight and will not jeopardize your
position in any case.

I have contacted you in this matter because of your surname resemblance to
my late client. As the personal attorney to Mr.Egor Zeptowitz,  It is my
legal rights to get his assets and clear his name since his wife and the
only female child, who are by law his next of kin died with him in a
terrible car accident. At this juncture. I am Barr.Gilbert Melue, a legal
practitioner and principal attorney. I am married with two kids, and the
name of my Wife is Mrs.Ann Melue, I am living here in my country called
Togo Republic and also my late client was living here with his family
before he died in a car accident together with the wife and their only
daughter.

I was personal attorney to late Mr.Egor Zeptowitz,  for five years before
he met his untimely death with all his family members, I have done
everything possible to trace his relatives without any luck. It was until
his bank invited me to their office last year and mandated me as his
personal attorney to locate and present to them his next of kin so that
they will release and transfer his outstanding funds with them, that is why
I decided to track his last name in search of a trust worthy person who
will assist me in putting claim to the funds, hence I found you.

What I am asking you to do is to act as next of kin to late Mr.Egor
Zeptowitz,  and laid claim to the money he left in the bank, instructing
them to release and re-transfer of funds to your nominate bank account in
your country. Upon receipt of your next mail with your sincere desire to
work with me, I will immediately give you an application form on the claim
that you fill out and fax it to the bank here to enable the deal officially
begin.

I can be reach via telephone number: +228 988 08 556.

 I anxiously await your response.

Thank you.Yours Sincerely,
Barr.Gilbert Melue.
