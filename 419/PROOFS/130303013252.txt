Mr Dina Rapheal.
GOOD DAY MR=A0Leonard Zeptowitz
Attention., To The Recipient..Mr.Dina Rapheal of western union benin republic.=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0detail of your fund deleivered from western union benin.you are one of those people that took part in receiving, Contract Inheritance =0APayment, Western Union Winning Prize funds and Lottery funds from African banks =0Aand Western Union Offices even from many lottery organizers few years ago and =0Athey refused to pay you,

The sum of $6 million has approved in your name as compensation of =0Acontractual-inheritance,as a=A0Contract Inheritance Payment, Western Union Winning Prize funds and Lottery =0Afunds from African banks and Western Union Offices even from many lottery =0Aorganizers few years ago.
Therefore, you should take this seriously as you can realize that who directed you to this organization has received his own =0Acontractual-inheritance compensation without any hitch the sum has been approved =0Afor payment through the three alternatives.

1) Through: Automated Teller Machine Atm cashing Card Visa-card Type
2) =0ACertified Bank Draft=A0 ( Foreign )
3) Bank to bank Transfer online

This =0Aare guaranteed and accredited means for paying you, since you may not like to =0Afly down here to sign the payment order and receive the monies in fiscal cash as =0AMr STEVE MORGAN did during his time.

You should therefore reconfirm the =0Ainformation of yours so I can sign all the relevant paper works on behalf of =0Ayou, to ascertain you are the real owner/beneficiary of these funds.

YOUR =0AFULL NAME________
YOUR ADDRESS__________
YOUR OCCUPATION_________
YOUR =0AAGE.____________
YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER/FAX LINE (MOBILE).________
YOUR =0ANext of Kin:________________________
PRIVATE =0AE-MAIL:________________________

And you will reply and indicate your =0Achoice on the two alternatives to receive the monies, so that I can draft and =0Asign an indemnification which the fund, bank draft bank agents and the Bank shall =0Asign in the court before transferring the monies to you, in which ever means of =0Ayour choice on receiving your payment.

The indemnification which shall be =0Asign before the law court is to ensure that the institutes shall deliver the =0Amonies to you without any delay or hoaxes for unreasonable =0Aprotocols.

Note:I am will respond to you from Rep Benin the COMPENSATION =0ATreasure Office and will as well pay you from there and also ship the payment =0Aitem to you through Benin, Since i has acknowledged the approval =0Aof the payment under the authority of the imf.
=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0I am looking forward to your positive cooperation fairly soon.

BEST REGARDALLAH BLESSMR Dina Rapheal.
