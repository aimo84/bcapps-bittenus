Dear Sir,

Greetings to you and your family.

In fact to tell you the truth,i am so delighted about your message to me
may the good Lord in his infinite mercy enlarge your coast for good this
season Amen.

If you can go through my message again you will understand my plight and
why i contacted you,i explained myself and i left with you my private
number for oral conversation +233249883844. please kindly call me and i
will appreciate your call.

Remember i am only doing this business with you in confident hoping that
nobody will betray each other at the end of this transaction,let me
reassure you that there is no risk practically involved in this,all i want
you to do is to stand claim as the original depositor of the funds as a
staff of this bank i don't have direct access over the funds that is why i
contacted to assist me.

Like i told you in my first message,this funds is generated in my branch
after the annual account of my branch(2012),as the manager of the branch i
placed it in what we call( ESCROW)call account, in brief escrow call
account is an account without a beneficiary.

All i want from you is to apply to my head office demanding them to close
your account and transfer your funds into your designated bank in your
country or your business area as the case maybe it is a bank to bank
transfer.If you agree to work with me i will send to you an application
from my bank demanding my head office to transfer your funds before you
send it to my head office you will send to me first a copy of the
(FILLED)application to enable me store your information in our data base
here in my branch where this fund is generated as the original beneficiary
before you send it to my head office remember don't mention my name to my
head office for them not to raise an eyebrows on the fund.

call me for more details about the funds i have  the deposit slip the bank
will request of you,i would have love to speak with you orally but,you did
not give me your phone number i told you the source of the fund and
everything about this business should be confidential.

Just call me for more details i will appreciate your call.when i hear from
you i will send to you a text of application for us to proceed, here in
Ghana it will only take three working days(72hrs) to transfer the funds
depending on our seriousness.

After our success i would like you to introduce me  into a lucrative
business in your country as i cannot come back here with such amount
because the authority here will question me on the source of the money,i
promise to offer you 40% of the total fund after deducting the tax in your
country.

Please,don't mention my name to my head office or to anybody for the sake
of my life,job and for them not to raise eyebrows on the fund,there is no
risk practically involved i promised, i have paid for the transfer charges
before contacting you,just stand claim and apply to my head office,i will
provide the deposit slip my  bank will demand of.

I wish you the best as we are about to start a life relationship, i have
attached my bank id and my international passport and i need yours for
trust and better understanding.

Await your urgent response.

God bless and best regards to your family.

Best Regards,
Brook Sam.
