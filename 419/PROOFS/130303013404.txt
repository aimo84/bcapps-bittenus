Thank you for your sympathy.

I explained briefly in my previous email where the wealth should be
distributed but the final action of effort and management has to come
from someone who is capable. Knowledge of global and local charity
organisation is required, excellence in investment and entrepreneurial
is necessary and above all these is a trustworthy personality.

If you match all/some of these qualities, I would be more than happy to
discuss the terms and compensation for your effort.

Kind regard

Mr.Yasuji Yagi.

NB: Please do not be offended if you do not get immediate reply to your
emails as this might be slightly difficult with my health condition.
