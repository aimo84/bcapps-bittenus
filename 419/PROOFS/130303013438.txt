How are you today.

The email i sent to you in summary is that, i am very sick now and in hospital in London and the bank want to confiscate my money as an unclaim fund, and that money was deposited by me and my late husband to raise a foundation for the less privilege and poor.

So i contacted you, if you will be able to carry the task in other to raise the foundation and help the less privilege to the glory of God because as for me, i am not strong and the doctor is telling me that the possibility for me to survive is not there.

I want you to send me your full name, address, telephone number and occupation, so that i will use it and write an authorization letter to the bank to release the money to you before i die.

I will be waiting

Mrs Mary Louis.
