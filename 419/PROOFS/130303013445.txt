Dear Sir,
Thanks for prompt response to my business proposal to you, first, I like to
inform you that the business for which I contacted you does not pose any
risks or threats to either you or my self, now or forever, as I have all it
takes to make it legal and legitimate with your corporation and
understanding, like i told you that we shall discuss about the sharing upon
hearing from you, and now that you have signified your intention I will
like you to propose how you want us share the fund between us by the time
it is paid to you, and the process of the funds being paid to you will not
take more than 7-9 working days from the day we commence the process, which
will be handled by my humble self.
Note that your confidence and trust is the most important factor needed for
the both of us to be happy and that responsibility lies in your hands, as
such I beg of you to please lets work with each other in these with love
and respect, which is why I want you to say how we shall share the money
when it is paid out, just like I said in my maiden mail to you that I will
need to present you as the rightful next of kin to be able to claim these
funds as such I shall request some of your personal details like your full
name and address, your identity card of either international passport or
drivers license, I shall need these information for me to be able to secure
the legal frame work which will confer the rights and privileges of the
said deposit on your person, papers which shall be sent to you as i procure
them and with that you shall need to contact the security company for the
amount to paid to you, so do send to me the details as above and I will
commence the process by the next working day.
For your information the amount in deposit is a total of US$12,800,000,
these shall be the pay out amount in total. Please do get back to me with
your position if we are working together then we can talk later.
thanks.
