I hope all is well with you and your family,

Thanks=0A for your response, I swear and assure you that every thing will surely =0Awork out fine for our own benefit and I promised you that this =0Atransaction will not harm any of us hence I am having all the =0Ainformation=E2=80=99s which I am to furnish you as soon as you contact to the =0Abank and please send to me your passport copy with trust.
=C2=A0

I =0Areceived your mail and the content of your message is duly noted and I =0Aam promising you that you won't regret being part of this transaction, =0Ayes i have contacted you in this transaction because of the urgent need =0Aof a foreigner hence a Burkinabe can not stand as the next of kin to =0Athis fund.
=C2=A0

Could you please call me immediately you receive this mail on=0A this telephone number: +226 68311 067.

I'm living in Ouagadougou Burkina Faso West Africa. I state my details as follows:

Mr.=0A Konan C. Salim. An accountant by profession, I'm 44yrs old, presently =0Achief auditor to Bank of Africa (BOA).I am married with two children. My=0A residence address no: C/575 ZONE DES AMBASSADE. Ouagadougou Burkina =0AFaso, concerning this transaction, although based on mutual trust and =0Aunderstanding as you will lead me in establishment over in your country.

As=0A you know this cannot be done by email alone to avoid delay. Meanwhile, I=0A would want to detail you a little on the fund to be transferred to your=0A account. This is not stolen money rather, a discovered abandoned money =0Abelonging to one of our late customers by name Mr. PAUL LOUIS HALLEY =0Afrom France who died years ago together with his entire family living =0Abehind his contract sum of US25.5, million dollars unclaimed in our =0Abank.

According to=0A one of our banking policies which stipulate that after years of =0Aunclaimed fund, the fund will automatically go into the treasury of our =0Abank and that's why I want you as next of kin to claim out the fund.

=C2=A0

Importantly=0A as I discovered, my bank does not know that he has no next of kin which=0A makes it easier for you to stand in as next of kin to Mr. PAUL LOUIS =0AHALLEY fund. I have taking this risk to contact you alone because of =0Asecret. I will provide you with some information=E2=80=99s related to the =0Acontract sum and a text of application which you will fill with your =0Abanking details and resend to bank by e-mail, introducing you as next of=0A kin to Mr. Paul Louis Halley and also instructing the paying bank (our =0Abank) to effect the transfer of the inheritance fund into any bank =0Aaccount which you will provide and submit to the bank.

Could you please call me on the above phone number immediately you receive this email, I will be eagerly=0A waiting for your urgent response,

I will be coming to your country immediately after the transfer of this fund to your bank account.
