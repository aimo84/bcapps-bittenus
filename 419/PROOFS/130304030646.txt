Be assured, that this transaction is risk free and a very genuine business. =0AI actually contacted you concerning a deceased customer Mr.Tareq Al-Jameeli (An Iraqi Crude oil merchant), and an investment he placed under our banks management. Once again I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.=C2=A0 I am contacting you independently and no one is informed of this communication I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.=C2=A0 =0ADuring the U.S and Iraqi war, our client Mr.Tareq Al-Jameeli who was a TOP Political party official and an Iraqi business man, made a fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of $12,000,000 (Twelve million United States Dollars) only with my bank,Hang Seng Bank Ltd. Upon maturity, several notices were sent to him, even during the war in Iraq. Again after the war, another notifications were sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that our client had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit his home.=0A=C2=A0=0AAfter further investigation, it was also discovered that Mr.Tareq Al-Jameeli, did had a next of kin which was his wife and it was discovered that she died alongside with her husband. So, $12,000,000 (Twelve million United States Dollars) is lying in my bank, and no one will ever come forward to claim it. So if nobody applies to claim the funds at the expiration of 8 years the funds will be reverted to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government. =0AMy proposal to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr.Tareq Al-Jameeli,=C2=A0 so that you will be able to receive this funds in your account.=C2=A0 I am prepared to give you the necessary backup as the closest surviving relation. I am also proposing that after successful execution of the business deal and the money in your account, the fund will be disbursed in the ratio 40/60; 40% of the fund will go to you for offering yourself as the next of kin and providing a foreign account especially an offshore account for safe transfer of the funds and 60% will be for me. =0AFollowing the master plan for this deal I am looking at a bank that have transaction understanding with my bank as first point of transfer to put off eyebrows that may be raised or to avoid unnecessary questioning.=0A=C2=A0=0AI am aware of the consequences of this proposal.=C2=A0 Once more I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you should discard this mail and forget I ever contacted you, It is because this a great opportunities that only come ones in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by. For once I find myself in total control of my destiny.

This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence.
