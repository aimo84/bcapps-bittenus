Dear Partner=2C
 Thank you for your response and I do appreciate your interest in partnering with me in getting this done. I am Mr William Leung Wing Cheung (Executive Director and Head of Personal Banking=2C Hang Seng Bank Hong Kong)=2C before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months=2C with a value of Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notices was sent to him=2C even during the war which began in 2003.
=20
Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit His Resident. After further investigation it was also discovered that Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So=2C Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration 5 years and six month the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop=2C my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan so that you will be able to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I have an attorney that will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan. Thanks for your ID sent=2C all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your personal phone number/fax and full contact information so that the attorney can commence his job.
 After you have been made the next of kin=2C the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in this matter=2C as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.
