Dear=C2=A0Leonard Zeptowitz, =0A=C2=A0 =0AThanks=0A for your response; I really appreciate your interest at this business =0Atransaction which will benefit both of us at the conclusion of the =0Atransaction. I want you to claim the remaining deposited balance of our =0Abank decease customer late Mr. Park Jun-Yung, in our bank custody. =0A=C2=A0 =0A=0A=0AI=0A am 45years old and I have worked with this bank of Africa Burkina Faso =0Aas auditor general for over eleven years now. Before contacting you, I =0Ahave fasted and prayed to the Almighty, believing strongly with my =0Aexperience as a senior Banker that nothing will stop us from achieving =0Asuccess within two weeks immediately we start.

The=0A Name of the deceased Customer is Mr. Park Jun-Yung He nationalized here=0A for years before he died. He was a contractor and also the major =0Asupplier of agricultural equipments in West Africa, and deal in gold and=0A diamond in Sierra loan before the war.

I=0A decided to contact you and use your name for the claim, as you are =0Agoing to=0A act as his business associate as I am here to provide all the =0Ainformation that will prove that you are the bona-fide beneficiary and =0Awe get the fund transferred to your provided bank account and the amount=0A of fund is U.S$10.600.000. 00million U.S-dollars .In event of any =0Aexpenses that you may occur during the course of this transfer will be =0Apaid back as soon as you confirm the fund in your nominated bank account=0A from the 10% that is set aside for expenses while 45% will be mine and =0Athe remaining 45% will be your own for all your efforts and assistance =0Afor the successful transfer.

Listen,=0A many Banks here in Africa use to confiscate a lot of foreigner=E2=80=99s money =0Ain their various Banks after the fund lying dormant for years. We Poor =0ABankers don=E2=80=99t gain anything if the fund is confiscated. I got this =0Aopportunity and decided to contact you, for the mutual benefit of our =0Aboth families because I don=E2=80=99t want the=0A money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund since nobody is =0Acoming for it.=0A=C2=A0=0A=0A=0AI=0A could have done this deal alone but because of my position in my =0Acountry as a civil servant (A Banker) we are not allowed to operate a =0Aforeign account and would eventually raise an eye brow on me during the =0Atime of Transfer because I work with this Bank. This is the actual =0Areason why it will require a second party or fellow who will forward =0Aclaims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to the Bank =0Aand also present a foreign account where he will need the money to be =0Are-transferred into on his request as it may be after due verification =0Aand clarification by the correspondent branch of the Bank.

The=0A transaction has to undergo normal banking procedures of transferring =0Ainheritance fund. I will give you and application claim form which you =0Awill fill your information=E2=80=99s and use it to=0A apply as his Business Associate and I will be here as your partner in =0Athe business, guiding you on what to do until the fund enters your =0Aaccount. This transaction is hitch-free on both sides (you and =0Ame) and has no negative impact but you must try to keep it confidential =0Aand as a top secret as you wish to know that I am still a staff of this =0ABank until this fund is transferred to your nominated bank account. For =0Aimmediate execution of this transaction, I have attached application =0Aform of claim; you=E2=80=99re to printout the form fills in the necessary gaps =0Awith your accurate information. I suggest you open a new bank account in=0A this regards for a smooth transfer of funds, after filling the form you=0A should sign the form and write the date for the application, scan it =0Aback to your system and to apply to our Foreign Remittance Department =0Ainside our Bank, your application to the bank of Africa is the official =0Acommencement of this transaction, I have=0A perfected everything to guarantee success and you should not be afraid =0Afor I am here as an insider in the Bank to assist you claims this money =0Asuccessfully.=0A=C2=A0=0A=0A=0AWhat=0A I expect from you is trust and commitment, I want this large sum of =0Amoney to be transferred with your assistance, and as a banker I know =0Athat if we follow up this transaction diligently it would be completed =0Awithin 12 Bank working days.

Please=0A I will like you to assure me that you will not betray as soon as my =0Abank remits this fund to your account; I also believe that this =0Atransaction will bring a long lasting family relationship between our =0Aboth families.=20

Thanks. =0AAlhaji Hassan. =0AAuditing manager, Bank of Africa BOA. =0AWebsite: http://boaburkinafaso.com +226 7567 6421.
