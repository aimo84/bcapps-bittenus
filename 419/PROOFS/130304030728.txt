Dear Friend,=A0Thank you for your response. I am a lawyer and personal confidant to Abdullah Senussi who was the intelligence chief of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi. I am contacting you to assist to secure this fund in your bank account to avoid any suspicion from the bank as I am an indigen and the account is a non-residential account. It is good to play safe in this kind of situation for its success and security purposes. I assure you once again there is no risk involved as I will not be part of this if there is any. With my age and opportunities in life I do not think I will be involving myself in a risky venture. I am a professional lawyer and this is my over a decade in the legal cycle. I am married with 3 children 2 girls and a boy. You should not have any fears as we are going to get necessary documents to back up the transfer and there will not be any question.=A0The account is in the name of Mohammed Abdullah al-Senussi who was killed in the Libyan
 civil war. I helped open the account during the Libya civil war following his father's directives as they did not know their faith or who will be survival. As a matter of fact I need your assistance to make this transaction happen. I have not seen you for the first time nor know much about you. I am contacting you on trust, believing you will not let me down or run away with this funds at the end. I am very confident about its successful accomplishment and assure your guidance all over. I will not like any blackmail or a defile of mine or yours image and reputation whereas I will advise you keep it a top-secret until this fund is transferred into your bank account.=A0I will present you as the business associate to Mohammed Abdullah al-Senussi and with my assistance the fund will be officially approved and transferred to your account. I know very well that you might be wary of the fact that you are not in any way related to the deceased man but according
 to the laws of inheritance in Burkina faso one must not be a relative to the deceased in order to be able to apply for inheritance, this will certainly rule out your fears. You will stand as a business associate and next of kin to Mr.Mohammed which you know that someones business associate can come from any part of the world so it doesn't matter where you are.=A0Once the change of beneficiary form is endorsed 'Letter of Administration of Estates' will be issued in your name which is the legal document showing you as the beneficiary to the fund and also proofs that the money going into your account is genuine, free from drugs, terrorism and money laundering. With this certificate no questions will be asked by any government or authority. You should not have any fears as we have checked everything even before opening the account.
Once the fund is transferred to your account I will be in your country for investments and you will have 20% of the proceeds. We shall be considering several sectors with our main focus on Government Bonds, Property Development, Loan and Equity Financing for small and medium sized companies.=A0Go ahead and send your account information following below chart;=A0Bank Name:Bank Address:Account Number:Beneficiary Name:Swift Code(if any):=A0Personal information=A0Contact Address:Phone:Fax (if any):=A0Pls respond as quickly as possible with your account information to enable us put an application to the bank for the approval processes in your favor as the beneficiary.=A0Thank you for your time and attention.=A0Warmest regards,=A0Mr.Abbas Karim.
