Hello Leonard Zeptowitz!

I wish to acknowledge the receipt of your email confirmatory response indicating your interest and willingness to follow up with the cash delivery arrangement for the delivery of your funds to you by cash at your doorstep. However, I wish to assure you that you have every cause to trust both I and my colleague, because we will arrange to secure and process every required documentation needed to back-up the fund at every customs port of entry, and such documentation will allow us a free passage through the customs at the Airport without inspection.

Furthermore, I wish to let you know that you will not be required to provide any expenses on this mission, except for the fact that the Diplomatic Bullion Boxes, which will be used for your operation will be procured by you from the Consultant in United Kingdom and the cost of such boxes will be paid by you. But such boxes are not much expensive as you may think. This box is operated only through a high sensitive card which must bear the inflared Picture of the beneficiary. The box can only be opened if the bearer of the decoding card is the Picture element conducted and instrumented in the Security lock card. Also, there is a key-code which has a 16, or 21 or 12 digit numbers depending on the size of the Bullion Box. This digital numbers is the decoder of the Inner Inter locks, which will either accept to open or refuse if the Picture of the beneficiary in the card is not present before the micro eyelash of the Bullion Trunk Box. Because of this sophistication, the box cannot be opened without your presence. And that makes it very ideal for Diplomatic immunity, since you can be present only when we have reached you in your country.

For us to secure this Bullion Trunk Diplomatic Boxes, you must contact the Diplomatic Security Consultant in United Kingdom. The Consultant will need your Passport-sized photograph through e-mail attachment, so that they can download directly from the system into the Box Inter-Lock and inflare the instrumented locker control card. Also, they will furnish you with the secret digital numbers, while they will furnish us with the Stuffing code, which will allow us to load the fund into the boxes. The boxes are in many types and sizes. The large, the medium and the standard. The reference part numbers for the Boxes are as follows:

Large Size: DBB820 TC1101208
Medium Size: DBB640 TC1102416
Standard Size: DBB620 TC1112405

Furthermore, our specified percentage will be furnished to you in my next email. However, it is very important for you to note that I and my companion (Fredrick Clifton Wesson) will be delivering the funds to you by cash at your doorstep, and not to be delivered through any courier company. Also, we will arrange to secure all required documentations, which will back-up the fund at any custom port of entry, including the Anti-Terrorist and Drug Clearance Certificate, which will certify that the source and origin of the fund is free and clear from any financial misconduct. All these are our responsibility on this mission. Your only responsibility on this mission is for you to procure the Bullion Boxes from the Consultant in United Kingdom at your own cost, and it is your only responsibility on this misson.

In any case, I will furnish you with more details and operational modalities needed on this mission in my next email, including copies of my international passport and my colleague's passport.

Yours Sincerely,

Anton Tony Zajc
