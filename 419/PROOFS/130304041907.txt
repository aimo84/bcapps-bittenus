Dear Mr. Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thanks for your email.  I am grateful for finding time to respond to me irrespective of your busy schedule.  I believe you may have understood my first letter to you.  But to digress a little, this money is an excess of what my bank (Ned Bank of South Africa) made in 2012 fiscal year.  As a  Manager of one of its branches and head of Internal Auditors I retained this sum without the knowledge of the bank.  I can assure you authoritatively that nobody except you knows about this funds.  I placed it in a secret account to escape being noticed or detected.  All I want is for you to provide an account where the money will be transferred by using your personal identification/information to process everything.  This is a top secret and should be handled as such.  I will give you more details as soon asnyou confirmed your interest and participation.  I will look forward to your quick response.

Sincerely,
Mr. Reuel Khosa
