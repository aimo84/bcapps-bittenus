Dear: Leonard Zeptowitz=2C
This is a life time opportunity and 100% legitimate. Violet my wife and I have decided to make sure this is put on the internet for the world to see. My wife has cancer=2C and we are both from Canada but presently living in United Kingdom as we are both old=2C and have no child of our own. am not getting any younger and you can imagine having no kids at this age. You see after taken care of the needs of our immediate family members=2C we decided to donate the remaining of the $11 Million to other individuals around the world in need=2C the local fire department=2C the Red Cross=2C Haiti=2C hospitals in Truro where Violet underwent her cancer treatment=2C and some other organizations in Asia and Europe that fight cancer=2C Alzheimer's and diabetes and the bulk of the funds deposited with the disbursement officer=2C the delivery company of this charity donation scheme. We have kept just 2% of the entire lottery sum to ourselves for the raining day.

To facilitate the disbursement process of the funds [ $500=2C000.00 USD ] which have been donated solely to you=2C please send us your contact address and a valid identification of your self so that we can forward your details over to the disbursement officer immediately. We are hoping that you will be able to use the money wisely and judiciously over there in your country. We will employ you to do what you can to eliminate the level of poverty in your region and also try to enhance the standard of living of as many people as you can because that is the only objective of donating this money to you in the first place.

Thank you for accepting our offer=2C we are indeed grateful.We anticipate your earliest response.
