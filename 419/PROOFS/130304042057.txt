Hello Leonard,=0A=C2=A0=0AThanks for your quick response to my very brief=0Aemail. I am Mr Wai Kin Chim, the Chief Credit Officer of Bank of China in Hong=0AKong. I contacted you regarding the estate of our late customer and an=0Ainvestment placed under our banks management 6 years ago.=0A=C2=A0=0AI would respectfully request that you keep the=0Acontents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information=0Ayou come by as a result of this mail. I contacted you independently and no one=0Ais aware of this communication.=C2=A0=0A=C2=A0=0ABased on my advice to our late customer in 2007,=0Awe spun his money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for=0Aour first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at this=0Apoint at over 10 million United States Dollars. In mid 2009, he instructed that=0Aprincipal sum($8.3m) be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent=0Ainvestment requiring cash payments in Europe.=0A=C2=A0=0AWe got in touch with a specialist bank in Europe=0Awho agreed to receive this money for a fee and make cash available to him. In=0ALine with the instructions, the money was deposited with the bank in Europe and=0Ahe told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway=0Alater that week. This was the last communication we had, this transpired around=0ASeptember 2009.=0A=C2=A0=0AIn September last year, we got a correspondence=0Afrom the bank informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This=0Awas an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I=0Amanaged the private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the=0Adeposit at the bank in Europe and I could not understand why he had not come=0Aforward to claim his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate him. I=0Aimmediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department=0Aof Bank of China.=0A=C2=A0=0AFour days later, information started to trickle=0Ain, apparently he was dead. A person who suited his description was declared=0Adead of a heart attack in Canne, South of France. We were soon enough able to=0Aidentify the body and cause of death was confirmed. The bank launched an=0Ainvestigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation=0Aand also to come forward to claim his estate. He has no next of kin and that is=0Athe reason I am writing you is because you share same last name with him.=0A=C2=A0=0AWhat I propose is that since I have exclusive=0Aaccess to his file, you will be made the beneficiary of these funds through the=0Ahelp of a lawyer which i shall employ here to prepare all legal documents to=0Aappoint you as his next of kin. On verification, which will be the details I=0Amake available to my bank, my bank will then instruct the bank in Europe to=0Amake payments to you. (More details will be shared on this in my next email=0Aafter i get your 100% percent approval)=0A=C2=A0=0AI know you might be thinking that you do not=0Aknow the deceased and this might be a bit strange for you, but please trust me=0Aon this as i shall educate you on every details you need to know about him when=0Athe time comes. For all your cooperation to make this happen, I propose 50% of=0Athe total sum to you after completion but before we proceed to that effect=0Athere shall definitely be a written contract between both parties .This happens=0Aevery time in the banking sector as the other option is that the money will=0Arevert back to the government as unclaimed funds. Nobody is getting hurt; this=0Ais a lifetime opportunity for us. I hold the KEY to these funds and as a=0AChinese National we see so much cash and funds being re-assigned daily. I would=0Awant us to keep communication for now strictly by my private email account.=0A=C2=A0=0A=C2=A0=0AKindly, note I am a man with a wonderful family;=0AI have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear=0Aas to the consequences, but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing=0Agained and that success and riches never comes easy or on a platter of gold. This=0Ais the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients.=0A=C2=A0=0ADo not betray my confidence. If we can be of one=0Aaccord, we should act swiftly on this. Please pardon my writing mistakes.=0AKindly get back to me immediately and reconfirm your full names, address and=0Atel number via email and will advice you on further details.=C2=A0=0A=C2=A0=0AI await your response.=0A=C2=A0=0AThanks,=0AWai Kin Chim=0A=C2=A0=0A=C2=A0=0APS: Like i mentioned before, please this is a=0Ahighly confidential proposal and i advise 100% discretion from your end. Once i=0Areceive your info as requested i shall furnish you with more precise details of=0Athe deceased and a copy of my id so you know exactly whom you are dealing with and=0Ato gain more level of trust and i would expect same from you.
