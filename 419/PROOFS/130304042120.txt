Attn: Mr. Leonard,
=A0
Many thanks for your response to my proposition. I appreciate your interest and willingness to wrap up this transaction with us. Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free, as it will be handled in such a legal way that no laws of any country will be violated or breached in the process. All we need from you is maximum co-operation, absolute trustworthiness and assurance that you will not sit on the whole amount of money when transferred into your account, pending disbursement on the agreed ratio. I hope you have the capacity and experience to handle a transaction of this magnitude.
I deemed it necessary at this juncture to explain to you in details and clear terms how we shall proceed with this transaction to successfully actualize it within 10 banking days barring any delay. The procedure is very simple and straight forward. Recall that=A0I am an accountant with the Nigerian National petroleum corporation (NNPC), hence I am in the position to secure all the vital documents needed to position you as the sub-contracator/Beneficiary to claim the contract funds. My home work over here is to be providing you with every necessary information our corporation may require from you to authenticate you as we claim. As civil servants, we do not have the financial muscle to finance the documentation required in this transaction therefore, your financial
assistance will be required in this aspect. We have agreed to give you 40% of the total funds, 50% for myself and colleagues while the remaining 10% will be set aside to defray any expenses that may be incured by both parties during the course of the transaction. If this condition is acceptable by you, then we shall send you a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) to sign in order to protect the interest of both parties, or you otherwise make your own suggestion known to us.
=A0
PROCEDURE:
=A0
We shall register a Company in your name with Corporate Affairs Commission here, back dated to the time the contract was originally executed. A contract Award Agreement and=A0Certificate will be secured in your company's Name dated the original period of the contract award and then a Job Completion Certificate in your Company's name attesting that the contract was executed and completed by your company satisfactorily. All these documents will be procured through the back door with the assistance of our contact persons in the concerned offices. As soon as these documents are ready, an application for claim will be filed to our corporation to initiate the claim. Like=A0I have stated in my previous message, every necessary machinery for a swift approval and effecting of the payment has been put in place and as staffs of the corporation, our presence in the ministry and involvement in the transaction will facilitate the conclusion of the transaction.
In order to set the ball rolling, you are expected to furnish us with the following information: Your full Name, Company's Name, Address, Line of Business, Age, direct Telephone and Fax number. With the requested information, we shall commence the necessary underground work here. If you have any question, feel free to contact me for further clarification or you can call on my direct telephone number below so we can discuss and establish the necessary understanding needed for success in this transaction.
Looking forward to your earliest response.
