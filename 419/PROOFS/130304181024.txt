Dearest Mr. David,

I have received your mail.

I am proceeding to the bank with the available information.

I want this transfer to be done immediately. To enable me leave here.
I am truly going through a lot of stress since my daddy died. This
will end as soon as the transfer is done.

Mail me now and let me now also that you have received my mail. And if
there is any question you might ask me before the bank contacts you.

I wait for your mail.

Annas
