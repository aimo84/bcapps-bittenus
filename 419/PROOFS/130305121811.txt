=0ADear=C2=A0 Leonard Zeptowitz,
=0A
=0AI read your mail I want you to know that is not of him that walked nor he that=0Awillet but of God who sheath mercy and grace, listen, when the anointing of God=0Acame open David the son of jess, he never know, he was taking care of his=0Afather's sheep=E2=80=99s, the Lord choose him and Samuel came looking for him, and he=0Awas found, so you must know that there are one or two million people in this=0Aworld but the spirit of God touches me to choose you to help me in=0Aaccomplishing my promise to God.
=0A
=0AI know you are surprise on receiving this letter, but as a servant of the=0Aliving God, you should know that our ways are not the ways of God. the Bible=0Atells me that God works in many ways and all things works out for good to them=0Athat believed in God. Proverbs 3:5-6 says: Trust in God with all your heart and=0Alean not on your own understanding.=C2=A0 In all your ways acknowledge Him and=0AHe will make your paths straight.
=0A
=0AInfact, It is also by the leading of the spirit of God that I choose you in=0Aobedience and love to fulfil my desire to God.
=0A
=0APlease, I want you to understand that this benevolence is in fulfilment of the=0Adesire and decision of my late husband which I am persuaded to actualize. This=0Amoney in the trunk box is designated for humanitarian and Charity services with=0Aspecial emphasis. This must be disbursed with every appropriation,=0Aaccountability and prudence to the glory of God. My bible says in Revelation=0A22:12=C2=A0 behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to=0Aeveryone according to his work.
=0A
=0A=C2=A0I will want you to handle this, since my health can not allow me as I=0Ahave been placed for dialysis check up periodically.=20
=0A
=0A=C2=A0I will want you to send me your full name, your Age, your Occupation,=0AHome or Office address and phone number so that I can write an authorization=0Aletter that will officially and legally approved you as the next of kin to this=0Afund in the trunk box, so that even if I am no more, your claim to the trunk=0Abox will not be in doubt. I will be sending you the certificate of deposit of=0Athis trunk box immediately after i see your willingness ready.
=0A
=0AI want you to understand that none of my husband's relatives knows about this,=0Abecause they are selfish and have sold my late husband properties away. And my=0Alate husband warned that they should not know any thing about this money in the=0Atrunk box. This is why I don=E2=80=99t want to donate this to any nearby organization=0Aor person here because I can not disobey my late beloved husband even in death.
=0A
=0AEnsure you reply this letter and the needed information immediately so that I=0Awill take my final decision.
=0A
=0AThanks and may God bless us all.
