How are you with your family? I hope fine. I'm happy to inform you about my success in getting those funds from BOA ( Bank of Africa ) transferred under the cooperation of a new partner from Venezuela, Presently i'm in Venezuela, meanwhile I didn't forget your past efforts to assist me in transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how. Now contact my secretary in Burkina-Faso West Africa through her e-mail id (marriamphilip70@yahoo.com) ask her to send you the A.T.M worths sum of ($450,000.00 US Dollars) which I kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me in this transaction. so feel free and get in touch with my secretary Ms.Mariam Philip she will send the A.T.M to you.
