Dearest Sir=20

It gives me a great pleasure to read your reply. I must commend you for taking your time to respond to my mail. Thank you so much.
first i want to give you brief introduction of myself, My name is Amanda Ben the only daughter of my late father Chief Dr Dunga Ben a formal supporter of our ex president, presently i am residing in Abidjan Cote d' Ivoire and looking up to your assistance to travel out as soon as possible because as a result of the civil war that was fought in my country in 2011 things have been critical with me, I was born on Friday , the 19th day of April, 1989  ( twenty-four (24) years old in April this year  ) , single and never married , 5ft 8 inches tall, 55kg weight , black hair and brown eyes . I love singing , watching television , studying , i am respectful , honest , etc , I hate lies , dishonest people , promise and fail , taking others for granted , My hobbies include taking care of people, sharing problems with others and find solution to the problems, going to beach with my friends, etc.

I lost my both parents during this deadly political war that damaged thousands of innocent souls in my country. My family was among the first target of the rebels because my late Father was a successful businessman who deal in cocoa and gold dust and also a politician supporting the then government when the problems was about to start.

Due to this all the members of my family was murdered in a cold blood and our family house was set ablaze. I was lucky and escaped death because I was in bordering school when this deadly incident took place. It is only myself who is alive now and I managed to make my way to a nearby country called Senegal from there I came back to Abidjan where I am staying in a UN camp now when our Lawyer called me to come and claim my fathers money, which is why i contacted you to help me on the transfer, I am hoping for a day I will be totally free from the pains and shackles of life. I have encountered pain and suffering ever since I lost my parents but I know that someday I will wear a smile on my face again.

I have much to tell you. However I want to know if you are willing and ready to help me at this time. To help me receive the fund in your country and help me further my education and become somebody in the society. To give me a better life. this thing has been bothering me, I have kept it to myself because I am afraid to disclose it to anyone. I am afraid of betrayal. I am afraid someone might take advantage of me if I should disclose it to anyone.

I want to believe that for everything in Life there is a reason, I don=E2=80=99t know if you are conversant with issues happening in my Country. We last year had a Civil War after 2 Presidential candidates claimed victory in an election and sworn themselves in as Presidents=E2=80=A6.making the (then) incumbent Laurent Gbagbo and his bitter rival (opposition) Alassana Quattara rule the country at the same time which resulted to Cote d=E2=80=99Ivoire having 2 sitting President at the same time,  you can read more of the story here http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2011/03/ivory_coast_continued_unrest.html

How you can help now is to provides an account in your country where i can transfer my inherited fund, so i would like you  to contact my attorney  lawyer and require from him exactly which step is necessary  to take to insure swift and peaceful transfer of the fund to your account.without any delay as i need this transfer to be completed swiftly
