Dear Partner,
 Thank you for your response and I do appreciate your interest in
partnering with me in getting this done. I am Mr William Leung Wing Cheung
(Executive Director and Head of Personal Banking, Hang Seng Bank Hong
Kong), before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan
who was with the Iraqi forces and also businessman made a numbered fixed
deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four million Five
Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity
several notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003.

Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response
came from him. We later find out that Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan along with
his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast
that hit His Resident. After further investigation it was also discovered
that Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan did not declare any next of kin in his
official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also
confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew
of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four million Five Hundred Thousand
United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come
forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of
my country at the expiration 5 years and six month the funds will revert to
the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you
as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal Bastaan so
that you will be able to receive his funds.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE:

I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall
come out successful. I have an attorney that will prepare the necessary
document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Aadel Akgaal
Bastaan. Thanks for your ID sent, all that is required from you at this
stage is for you to provide me with your personal phone number/fax and full
contact information so that the attorney can commence his job.
 After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in
for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of
probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be
provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in this matter, as we are
going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the
necessary documents.

Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this
issue, also please send me your personal private cell phone/fax number. And
finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation.
I shall be waiting for your response and assurance along with your recent
residential address, please note that all further corresponding email
should be via this email address.

Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated

Kind Regards,

William Leung.
