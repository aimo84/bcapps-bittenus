Dear Sir=2C

Thank you for your response.

I am Chief Nana Kuffour=2C Director of Operations here at Leading Continental Private Investment Bank.
Nearly 12 years ago=2C we had a client who was from America=2C named Jefferson Donald Davis (Master Sergeant).
He was one of America's top military men deployed to Afghanistan=2C who later died.

As of the time he deposited this fund here in the escrow account=2C he left no beneficiary to the account.
Time had overlapped and the bank will assign this fund to anyone who has the actual root of connectivity (one who possesses the documents covering the money) to this fund or else in few months to come the bank will transfer all the money into its treasury account.

In that regard=2C I want to make you the automatic beneficiary of the account.
Meanwhile you will have to contact the bank and introduce yourself as the beneficiary/next of kin to Jefferson Donald Davis. I will play my role by making few changes to the details of the deceased client in our bank database=2C then=2C I will send you copies of the same documents (because the bank will ask you for verification).

In the mean time=2C kindly return an urgent reply giving the details below:

Full government name:
Occupation:
House address:
Telephone #:
Marital status:
Please attach any valid id :- Can be driver's license or national id card)
And attach 1 passport size photograph.

I will wait to hear from you at your earliest convenience.

Thank you.

Sincerely yours=2C
Chief Nana Kuffour=20
Director of Operations
