Thank you very much for your response and interest
 in this transaction. Please note that i have no intention of asking you
 to send me money. As we communicate have in mind that you are dealing=20
with a responsible family man. If you read my terms below and you are=20
not convinced then feel free to back out of this transaction.
=20
Let
 me start by introducing myself again. I am Park Whang I work with the=20
Bank of Korea here in South Korea. I got your contact from a trusted=20
business directory from your country. Before the 31st of July=2C 2000 our=20
client  Mr. Andreas Schranner a German property magnate and also a=20
businessman=2C made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months=2C with a
 value of Eleven millions Five Hundred Thousand United state Dollars=20
Only (USD$11.5M) in my branch. Upon maturity
 several notices was sent to him=2C with no response. Recently another=20
notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later=20
found out that Mr. Schranner along with his wife and only daughter along
 side their in-law and grand kids had been killed in a terrible plane=20
crash=2C See link below=3B
=20
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/859479.stm
=20
After
 further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Andreas Schranner
 did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the=20
paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time
 he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my=20
bank. So=2C Eleven million five hundred thousand United State Dollars=20
(USD$11.5M) is still lying in my bank and no one will come forward to=20
claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the Korean financial
 law=2C at the expiration of 11 years the funds will revert to the=20
ownership of the South Korean
 Government if nobody applies for claim. Against this backdrop=2C my=20
suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the
 next of kin to Mr. Andreas Schranner so that you will be able to=20
receive his funds.
=20
MODALITIES:
=20
I want you to know that I
 have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful.=20
My attorney will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as
 the next of kin to Mr. Andreas Schranner=2C all that is required from you
 at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names=2C Address=20
and copy of identification so that the attorney can commence his job.=20
After you have been made the next of kin=2C the attorney will also file in
 for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and of=20
probate in your favor for the movement of the funds to an offshore=20
account that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all=20
in this=2C as we are going to adopt a legalized
 method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents.=20
Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning=20
this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank=20
account we shall then share in the ratio of 85% for me and 15% for you.
=20
READ THE FOLLOWING AND GET BACK TO ME:
=20
You
 should note that this project is capital intensive=3B meaning you need to
 be able to open an online account with a bank i will direct you. I need
 your total devotion and trust to see this through. I know we have not=20
met before=2C but I am very confident that we will be able to establish=20
the necessary trust that we desire to execute this project. I am now in=20
contact with a foreign bank that shares the same telex type with my=20
bank. This will enable me transfer the funds from my bank to the=20
offshore bank without stress. I now intend that you open an offshore=20
domiciliary account on your name in this foreign bank. The
 money would be transferred to that account which you will open in the=20
bank. This is the best way to move the funds. I want us to have peace of
 mind when we conclude this transaction. Kindly listen to my=20
instructions and follow them religiously. Also you have to know that I=20
cannot transfer this money on my name as my bank will be aware of my=20
involvement. This is where I need you to represent both of us.
=20
As
 a result of this=2C you will have to open an account in the corresponding
 bank and that is your only financial obligation. After this=2C the money=20
will be transferred from my bank to the account which will be set up on=20
your names. No other person will be involved in this transaction=2C You=20
can then instruct the bank to transfer our various shares into our=20
respective home bank accounts. I will perfect the documentations with=20
the assistance of my attorney to give the transaction the legal right=2C=20
In my next email i will send a copy of the legal
 application for the funds release which you are to fill with your=20
details and sign=2C then scan and send as attachment back to me. In other=20
to grant the attorney the legal power to prepare the required legal=20
documents making you the sole beneficiary to the funds and also process=20
your claims.
=20
Before I commence=2C I need you to send me any form=20
of your identification (I.D=2C Driver's license or passport) I will=20
process the necessary paper works. I hope you understand why I need all=20
these. The money in question is huge and I want to ensure that we reach a
 proper agreement=2C before I proceed to give you all the details to=20
commence. I will send you a copy of my work I.D upon receipt of your=20
identification. You will also receive the names and contact details of=20
