Thank you very much for your response and interest in this transaction. Please note that i have no intention of asking you to send me money. As we communicate have in mind that you are dealing =0Awith a responsible family man. If you read my terms below and you are =0Anot convinced then feel free to back out of this transaction.=0A=A0=0ALet=0A me start by introducing myself again. I am Park Whang I work with the =0ABank of Korea here in South Korea. I got your contact from a trusted =0Abusiness directory from your country. Before the 31st of July, 2000 our =0Aclient=A0 Mr. Andreas Schranner a German property magnate and also a =0Abusinessman, made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a=0A value of Eleven millions Five Hundred Thousand United state Dollars =0AOnly (USD$11.5M) in my branch. Upon maturity=0A several notices was sent to him, with no response. Recently another =0Anotification was sent and still no response came from him. We later =0Afound out that Mr. Schranner along with his wife and only daughter along=0A side their in-law and grand kids had been killed in a terrible plane =0Acrash, See link below;=0A=A0=0Ahttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/859479.stm=0A=A0=0AAfter=0A further investigation it was also discovered that Mr. Andreas Schranner did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the =0Apaper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my =0Abank. So, Eleven million five hundred thousand United State Dollars =0A(USD$11.5M) is still lying in my bank and no one will come forward to =0Aclaim it. What bothers me most is that according to the Korean financial law, at the expiration of 11 years the funds will revert to the =0Aownership of the South Korean Government if nobody applies for claim. Against this backdrop, my =0Asuggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Andreas Schranner so that you will be able to =0Areceive his funds.=0A=A0=0AMODALITIES:=0A=A0=0AI want you to know that I=0A have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. =0AMy attorney will prepare the necessary document that will back you up as=0A the next of kin to Mr. Andreas Schranner, all that is required from you=0A at this stage is for you to provide me with your Full Names, Address =0Aand copy of identification so that the attorney can commence his job. =0AAfter you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in=0A for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and of =0Aprobate in your favor for the movement of the funds to an offshore =0Aaccount that will be provided by you. There is no risk involved at all =0Ain this, as we are going to adopt a legalized=0A method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. =0APlease endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning =0Athis issue.

I know we have not =0Amet before, but I am very confident that we will be able to establish =0Athe necessary trust that we desire to execute this project. I am now in =0Acontact with a foreign bank that shares the same telex type with my =0Abank. This will enable me transfer the funds from my bank to the =0Aoffshore bank without stress. I now intend that you open an offshore =0Adomiciliary account on your name in this foreign bank. The=0A money would be transferred to that account which you will open in the =0Abank. This is the best way to move the funds. I want us to have peace of=0A mind when we conclude this transaction. Kindly listen to my =0Ainstructions and follow them religiously. Also you have to know that I =0Acannot transfer this money on my name as my bank will be aware of my =0Ainvolvement. This is where I need you to represent both of us.=0A=A0=0AAs=0A a result of this, you will have to open an account in the corresponding=0A bank and that is your only financial obligation. After this, the money =0Awill be transferred from my bank to the account which will be set up on =0Ayour names.
