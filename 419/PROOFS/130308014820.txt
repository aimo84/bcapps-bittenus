=0A=0ADear associate,=0A=0AThanks for acknowledging my mail. Now I know this mail will definitely Come to you as a huge surprise, but please kindly take your time to go through it carefully as the decision you make will probably go a long way to determine my future and continued existence. First, let me introduce myself. I am Capt. David Howard, assigned to 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine Division, 3rd Marine Expeditionary Force, the Helmand Province in Afghanistan. I am desperately in need of assistance and I have summoned up courage to contact you. I am seeking your assistance to evacuate the sum of $5,000,000.00 (Five million USD) to the States or any safe country, as far as I can be assured that it will be safe in your care until I complete my service here. This =C2=A0is no stolen money and there are no dangers involved. =C2=A0=0A=0ASOURCE OF MONEY:=0ASome money in various currencies was discovered concealed in barrels with piles of weapons and ammunition at 36 meters away from the militants hide-out in southern Helmand during a rescue operation, and it was agreed by all party present there at that time that the money be shared amongst us. No compensation can make up for the risks we have being taken with our lives in this hell hole.=0AThe above figure was given to me as my share and to conceal this kind of money became a problem for me. So, with the help of a German contact working here and his office enjoys some immunity, I was able to get the packages(money) out to a safe location entirely out of trouble spot. He doesn't know the contents of the packages(money), he believes that it belongs to an Asian American who died in air raid. Before giving up, he trusted me to hand over the packages(money) to his family. There is a secure way of getting the packages(money) out to a safer country for you to pick up. I will discuss this with you when I'm sure you are willing to assist me.=0A=0AOne passionate appeal I will make to you is not to discuss this issue with a third party, if there's any reason to reject this offer please destroy this mail as any leakage of this information will be too bad for us. I do not know for how long we will remain here but hopefully it won=E2=80=99t be too long, I have survived two suicide bomb attacks by the special grace of God, this and other reasons I will mention later has prompted me to reach out for help. I look forward to your reply.=0A=0AKind regards,=0ACapt.
