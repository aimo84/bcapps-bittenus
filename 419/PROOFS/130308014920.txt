Dear Partner Leonard ,

Thanks for picking interest in my proposal .

Basically,The funds €1.15 million Euros in question belongs to one of our bank deceased client who died in plane crash with his family members hence,there is no one else with the knowledge of the funds in our bank since 9 years ago because i am his account officer at the bank before his death hence,i have access to all his files .Thus,i feel this is an avenue for you and i to get this funds to ourselves for better use otherwise ,the funds will be shared amongst our bank executives by June, 2012 as abandoned & unclaimed funds.

My bank client and his entire family was involved in the charter plane which crashed in the city of Samburu-Kenya, which is home to popular game reserves on 21st july,2003. Unfortunately my client and his entire family were among those who where confirmed dead as a result of the crash. Since after their death, I have made several inquiries to their embassy to locate any of my clients relative no avail being his account officer, hence I contacted you.

In anticipation of your understanding of this business transaction details which requires urgent attention from both of us as partners since you have agreed to forge ahead with me till the realization of our goal through Allah's heavenly assistance especially when all arrangement has been perfected before you are contacted .

Anyway,You are contacted by a random search of peoples profile on the internet and believe me that it will be plausible and realistic saying his beneficiary and next of kin come outside our country and believe you me that ,such secret is never done with somebody that is closer to you because people can be very jealous especially when it is sure that i must take more than him hence,he could decided to foil the whole deal .

Frankly speaking,i have earlier gotten response from 2 peoples about this transaction but,they are asking for 55% & 50 % respectively from the total funds so,i decided never to have anything doing with them because they are too greedy for my liking and since it is in the ethics of our banking principle here in Burkina Faso that such funds shall be transferred to the concerned bank treasury as abandoned funds if left unclaimed for a period over 8years.

Thus,for the realization of this transaction and a step further into the commencement of this deal hence,since you have send your contacts info's to me being the deceased account monitoring officer at the bank even before his death.

For the proper arrangement of the important documents at the bank in your name being a the sole beneficiary and signatory to the deceased left over funds and accounts . After the completion of this paper works ,i shall apply for an ATM gold master card in your favor from our bank authority without delay towards the achievement of our goal since it will be easier removing about €1,000--€7,500 everyday with this card once it arrives in your country through DHL .

I shall later send you my private account in Dubai-United Arab Emirate where you shall be transferring my 60% share of the funds per each withdrawal of the funds using the ATM gold master card.

I have decided to send my scanned photograph to you for us to get to know each other physically until when we get to see each other face to face in your country if you can arrange my invitation letter or Dubai-United Arab Emirate since it is visa free country.

I shall be waiting for your photograph too.

However,be informed that i am a man of 47years old with 14years working experience with this bank.

I have 4 children aged 23 years old girl , 18 years girl ,16 years old boy and 10 years old son with my wife at the age 40 before she died some 3years ago . Dear partner,i have seen and witnessed poverty at it's highest level because my parents are poor hence,feeding us their 12 children were problems not to talk of sending us to school until some Baptist church missionary came to our village with a view to helping us get to the door of elementary school.

Therefore,i am seen this transaction opportunity as a compensation by God for all the suffering i went through while at tender age with a gift of having enough money to send my children to better school for good and quality education so that,they shall be useful to themselves and the world at large towards better future.

I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

It will be a good thing if we should begins a life time friendship and business relationship towards our better future starting this year 2013 with lots of money in our bank account for better investment into the future for us and that of our children and family at large .

Eagerly awaiting for your response.

Yours Faithfully
MR Usman KABORE
