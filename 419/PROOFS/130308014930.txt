My dear brother,

I want to thank you so much for your response to my recent mail. I
pray that we may handle this project with mutual understanding and
absolute sincerity. I am hopeful that this relationship shall bring
about a lasting family union and happiness. So kindly allow me to
trust you and not to betray me.

 I want you to know also that I have done all the necessary research
in my capacity here as one of the directors and assure you that we
have no risk or any fear in this business.
 But you must follow my instructions and guides to avoid mistakes. I
shall use my position here to influence any decision in this bank
during meeting to make sure that the money must be transfered to you.

Please you have to maintain regular communication with me so that I
shall always tell you whatever is happening in the bank. And any
letter you may receive from the bank, you have to forward it to me for
advice before you can reply to avoid mistakes ok. I hope you will not
seize it or kill me when I shall come over to your country for my own
share and that you will not betray me.

To start the process, you have to fill a form for international
transfer and submit it to our bank for processing. Please do not let
them know of my involvement in this transaction so that they will not
cancel the payment.
Keep it secret to both of us ok.
The process shall cost both of us some little expenses which must be
made before the transfer. The expenses shall be made by you and I from
our purse. Both of us shall contribute to it so that it will be easy
and less bulky for one person to bear. Every individual expenses shall
be recorded and refunded immediately the fund get into your account
before we share the principal amount.
The expenses shall be on legal change of name of account and ownership
before transfer.

 I hope you are very sure that you can handle this business without
dissapointment or betrayal. Please do not disclose this to anybody,
keep it secret because I do not want anybody to know the source of our
riches to avoid problem in future. Can you handle your part of the
expenses? Can you be trusted with full confidence.
If you need any clarification or discussion, feel free to call me ok.
SO SHOULD I SEND THE  FORM? You can call me for any clarification.

Regards.,
Alh. Hassan Dasuki
