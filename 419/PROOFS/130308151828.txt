Dear Sir,

I am Mr. Cheng Wei, Manager Asset Management Department for the Wing Lung
Bank in Hong Kong.I have decided to contact you regarding the estate of a
deceased client and an investment placed under our banks management many
years ago. I hope I have not embarrassed you as I have no choice as it is
now. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail
confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a
result of this mail. I contact you independently and no one is informed of
this communication.

In year 2000 the deceased; Mr. Robert Zeptowitz came to our bank to engage
in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us
that he had a financial portfolio of US$18,500,000. (Eighteen Million Five
Hundred Thousand United States dollars) which he wished to have us invest
on his behalf.

Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made
attractive margins for our first months of operation, the accrued profit
and interest stood at this point at over $2.350 million United States
Dollars. In mid 2002, he instructed that the principal sum and the accrued
profit, which stood then at US$M20.850,000.00 be liquidated because he
needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Hong Kong.
We got in touch with a specialist bank in Hong Kong the Nanyang Commercial
Bank (NCB) who agreed to receive this money for a fee and make cash
available to Mr. Zeptowitz. However, the Nanyang Commercial Bank got in
touch with us last year that this money has not been claimed. On further
enquiries we found out that Mr. Zeptowitz was involved in an accident in
Mainland China, which means he died intestate. He has no next of kin, hence
I am writing you to inform you that I shall be presenting you as the next
of kin to the Late Mr. Robert Zeptowitz.

What I propose is that since I have exclusive access to his file, you will
be made the beneficiary of these funds. My bank will contact you informing
you that money has been willed to you. On verification, which will be the
details I make available to my bank, my bank will instruct NCB to make
payments to you based on my recommendations. I know this might be a bit
heavy for you but please trust me on this. For all your assistance and
co-operation I propose that we split the money in half. In the banking
circle this happens every time. The other option is that the money will
revert back to the state.

Nobody is getting hurt; this is a lifetime opportunity for us. I hold the
key to these funds, and as a Chinese National we see so much cash and funds
being re-assigned daily. I would want us to keep communication for now
strictly by the above Emails and Telephone numbers that I shall you in due
course.

Please, again, note I am a family man; I have a wife and children. I send
you this mail not without a measure of fear as to t the consequences, but I
know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and
riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I
have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence.
If we can be of one accord, we should act swiftly on this. Please get back
to me immediately via email address above and let me know if you intend to
assist or not. If you also do not want to be involved kindly let me know so
as not to initiate further communication with you anymore.

I await your URGENT response.
