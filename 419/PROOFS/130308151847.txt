To this only what you have to do is to listen to =0Amy advice and instruction to achieve this great goal without any hitch =0Aof what so ever. This transaction is 100% legitimate and risk free in =0Athe since that it will undergo normal bank procedures as stipulated in =0Athe finance and allied matters decree.
