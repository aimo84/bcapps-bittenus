Dear,Leonard Zeptowitz

thanks for your swift respond.all I want you to do is to stand as my late father business partner and the bank will release my late father fund deposit to us. Moreover, I will be glad if you can travel to Ghana to meet me in person and we can complete the fund claim process within 14 days and we both can travel back to your country and work on investment together or better still, I can introduce you to my father's lawyer here and you can communicate he via email and I am sure he will tell you more about the claims and processing of the fund deposit under my late father's name.

I want to inform you that I am a Syrian and I am only here in Ghana to put claims to my late father`s fund deposit which was earned from his crude oil contract here with Ghana government. I want to assure you that my father`s fund is legal and 100% risk-free.

Please send me the below information for confirmation:

1. Your Full Name
2. Address
3. Country
4. Your Age
5. Phone Number
6. Copy of International Passport or Driver's License
=20
40% for you 60% for me I will like to be sure about you.

This is a very simple process and i just want you to assure me that you will remain trustworthy and reliable for us to have a big gain at the end. I am ready to reward you greatly for your assistance in this venture. Moreover, I want to reassure you , I will end here and wait for your next positive reply then i will give you my trusted lawyer contact information here.Please see attach documents.

Thanks

Regards,
