Hello=2C
I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contact you independently and no one is informed of this communication.

My names are Mr. Lowe Chan with First National Bank South Africa=3B I am getting in touch with you regarding the estate of a deceased client with similar last name and an investment placed under our banks management.

In 2001=2C Mr. H. Zeptowitz came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our private banking division. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 15.5million United State Dollar=2C which he wished to have us invest on his behalf.
Based on my advice=2C we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation=2C the accrued profit and interest stood at this point at over 17 million United State Dollar. In mid 2002=2C he instructed that the principal sum (15.5M) be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments. We got in touch with a Chase Private Bank who agreed to receive this money for a fee and make cash available to Him. However Chase Private Bank got in touch with us last year that this money has not been claimed. On further inquiries we found out that He was involved in an accident in Yokohama Japan=2C which means he died intestate in 2003. He has no next of kin and the reason I am writing you is because you are namesakes.

What I propose is that since I have exclusive access to his file=2C you will be made the beneficiary of these funds. The Chase Private Bank will contact you informing you that money has been willed to you. On verification=2C which will be the details I make available to First National Bank South Africa. Chase Private Bank will be instructed to make payments to you after all the necessary verification and application is done. You do not have to have known Him. I know this might be a bit heavy for you but please trust me on this. For all your troubles I propose that we split the money in half. In the banking circle this happens every time. The other option is that the money will revert back to the state.

Nobody is getting hurt=3B this is a lifetime opportunity for us. I hold the KEY to these funds=2C and as a Chinese man Banker in South Africa for many years now we see so much cash and funds being re-assigned daily. I would want us to keep communication for now strictly by this email l_chan33@live.com.

Please=2C again=2C note I am a family man=3B I have a wife and children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to the consequences=2C but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord=2C we should act swiftly on this. Please get back to me immediately via the fax or email above

I await your response.
