Hello,Leonard Zeptowitz=20
=C2=A0
I am Mr. James Nelson the Assistant =0ADirector Inspection Unit/United Nations Inspection Agency in O Hare =0AInternational Airport Chicago USA.

During my recent routine check=0A at the Airport Storage/vault on withheld packages, I discovered an =0Aabandoned shipment from a Diplomat from London and Africa, when scanned =0Ait revealed an undisclosed sum of money in two Metal Trunk Boxes =0Aweighing approximately 25kg each.

The consignment was abandoned =0Abecause the Contents was not properly declared by the consignee as =0A=E2=80=9CMONEY=E2=80=9D rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid interrogation=0A and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the Non Inspection =0ACharges which is Before bringing in the consignment into US and we =0Arefused to return back the consignment where it came from since, we have=0A already received it.
=C2=A0
On my assumption, each of the boxes will =0Acontain more than $5 Million to $5.5Million each and the consignment is =0Astill left in our Storage House here at the O Hare International Airport=0A Chicago USA till date. The details of the consignment including your =0Aname, your email address and the official document from the United =0ANations office in Geneva are tagged on the Metal Trunk boxes in your =0Afavor.

However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual =0Arecipient of this consignment, I will advise you to provide your current=0A Phone Number and Full Address to enable me cross check if it =0Acorresponds with the address on the official documents including the =0AName of the nearest Airport around your city.

Please note that =0Athis consignment is supposed to have been returned to the United States =0ATreasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in =0Aconcluding the
clearance processes.
=C2=A0
