Hello Friend=2C Leonard This is a life time opportunity and 100% legitimate. We quite understand you might be skeptical about this message due to the rapid of false organisation in the internet=2C so because of that my wife and I decided to make it known to the world by publishing it on the news. However=2C Violet my wife and I have decided to make sure this is put on the internet for the world to see and to ease your skeptism. For so doing you do not need to be skeptical about this donation to you. My wife had cancer and as you could see from the webpage=2C am not getting any younger and you can imagine having no kids at this age. You see after taken care of the needs of our immediate family members=2C we decided to donate the remaining of the $11Million to other individuals around the world in need=2C the local fire department=2C the Red Cross=2C Haiti=2C hospitals in Truro where Violet underwent her cancer treatment=2C and some other organizations in Asia and Europe that fight cancer=2C Alzheimer's and diabetes and the bulk of the funds deposited with  EQH BANK=2C the payout bank of this charity donation. We have kept just 2% of the entire lottery sum to our self for the raining day. To facilitate the disbursement process of the funds [ $500=2C000.00 USD ] which have been donated solely to you=2C please send us your contact address and a Valid  Identification(i.e either Driver's License/International Passport of yours) so that we can forward your details over to the payout bank. We are hoping that you will be able to use the money wisely and judiciously over there in your country. We will employ you to do what you can to alleviate the level of poverty in your region and also try to enhance the standard of living of as many people as you can because that is the only objective of donating this money to you in the first place. I like to re-assure you of the legitimacy of this Services as we will not be involved in any fraudulent act and will never be. We will advise as you as the "Sole Beneficiary" to be calm not to loose this great opportunity which millions of people are trying to entangled but the chances just couldn't come for them because a lot of people are out there to discourage them as they don't know how it works=2C and have never seen such before.

Sorry to inform you that I lost my wife last year due to cancer illness=2C though we started the drive of donating the fund but unfortunately i lost her along the line. And i am left alone to do this=2C but her memory still lives in me. so just try and get this donation soonest because know body knows tomorrow as i am not getting younger everyday. Thank you for accepting our offer=2C we are indeed grateful.
 God Bless YouAllen and Violet Large
