Selborne Chambers=0A10 Essex Street=0ALondon WC2R 3AA=0A=0AHello ,=0A=0AJust to let you know that I did get your email, I am very serious about this claim.Meanwhile I got your contact on my private search on whom to trust in this deal without jeopardizing or betray me. I am however, sorry not to have replied you promptly. See, I must warn you that calling me on the general office phone 020-7420-9500 or sending a fax to Fax: 020-7420-9555 is not safe for the fund claim because considering the fact that this deal is mine and not fully dependent on the office. Other members of the chambers might not support what I am doing right now but I am not going to sit here and watch $16Million belonging to a late client go to waste in the hands of the government! You may need to know that my late client Mr.Abdulhafid Zlitni handed an authorized legal consideration to me in particular so I cannot allow anyone in my office to jeopardize this possible chance of working this out with you and claiming the fund deposit. From now on, you may
 only reach me through my direct phone +44-871-915-4675 or send me faxes via my direct fax:+44-871-503-2112 for a more articulate business interaction between you and me. The phone line is permanent inside my office but is connected to my mobile phone which I take around with me. That means I can receive your call at any time of the day as far as this transaction is concerned.=0A=0ATo alleviate the extent of our talks on the phone when you call, I better give you a run down of the expectations in this deal. I shall send your particulars including a full contact address, a scanned copy of your identity of either passport or drivers license along with an application to the British High Court in the Department of ministry of Justice here in the United Kingdom for a change of beneficiary status of the deposited fund from Mr.Abdulhafid Zlitni to your name. This is the first thing we must achieve to give you full authority to the fund release. I already have with me, a legal Power of Attorney duly signed by late Mr.Abdulhafid Zlitni and endorsed by the then Commissioner for Oaths and Attorney General before the fund was deposited. I also have his Death Certificate from the Health Department in Central London. I will present them when submitting necessary papers because those are the main requirements in the British court of law to enable
 me support your application for the claims. I will send you the copies of all original documents as soon as we get the approval from the British High Court, the change of ownership status in your name. If we work closely on this together, we can still achieve everything this coming week.=0A=0ATo make this work, I will remain in my office and work with you as your legal attorney assisting for the fund claims. Only you and I shall be aware of the true situation of the claim. You must always bear in mind that I am a member of the Queen's Counsel and my assumed reputation does not encourage that I pursue the claims but no one will understand how painful it is to see the money go to waste so if we finish this, I will use my share as part of my retirement benefit. I shall send you an official Transaction Agreement with my office letter-headed paper which we shall both sign for surety of the deal and financial security on both sides. Remember that this is a fund claim which means when we get the money out of deposit, we shall split it on a 50/50% basis without anyone of us breaching the trust. You must however play your part well as the claimant because the court may deal directly with you and there must be no doubt in your mind. I am very confident
 that everything will go well till the fund is delivered to you in your country. Note that this claim does not concern your personal details, social security number, personal bank account statement or office details, just a straightforward claim for the fund deposited which you are next-of-kin to the deceased. I will arrange everything I can to make this as legal as possible so that after the claim, no one will have any cause to worry. I say this because as soon as we get the paper from the Department of Justice over here, no one can ever come up and have any counter claim for the said funds.=0A=0AIf you are confused about any of the above, feel free to call me as soon as possible (only on my direct lines) and I shall clarify you. Please send me those requirements as I mentioned earlier to enable me send an application to the British High Court of Justice in order to obtain the affidavit of change of beneficiary. Send me your current address, phone and fax number as well as a scanned copy of your passport or driver`s license as mentioned earlier to enable me apply for your affidavit of change.=0A=0AI wait to hear from you.=0A=0ARegards,=0AAjmalul Hossain QC=0ADirect Tel: +44-8719154675=0AFax: +44-8715032112=0A=0A=0A=0A=0A>________________________________=0A> From: Leonard Zeptowitz <leonard.zeptowitz+130309160003@gmail.com>=0A>To: ajmalul_hossain@yahoo.co.uk =0A>Sent: Saturday, 9 March 2013, 21:30=0A>Subject: About the email you sent me?=0A> =0A>Could you please give me details about the email you sent me?
