*Dear *Leonard Zeptowitz*,*

*I have received your mail and I thank you for accepting to do this
transaction with me and I want to assure you that before I contacted you
for this transaction, I have already worked out the legal logistics for the
sure success of this transaction so I will only require your absolute
trust, confidentiality and assurance that you will not to part with my
share of the funds when it eventually arrives your custody. This
transaction is real and there is no risk attached as all covering documents
of the transaction will be sent to you for your records and perusal.*

*Again, let me make you understand my power in affecting the transfer of
the funds to you. As I have already informed you on how this money is been
brought, and I know I have equally informed you on where the money was
deposited. I am in Command of my Unit here. I will prepare all the
necessary documents for the approval and registration of the funds in your
name as the beneficiary.*

*Now let me make you understand how this business is going to be done
successfully. Every week, a RED CROSS RELIEF JET flies to Europe, Asia,
Africa and United States from Afghanistan, to collect reliefs from donors.
I have two of my men as security to the Airplane, So after preparing all
document on your behalf as the owner of the fund, I will then seal up the
consignment which is with the RED CROSS to be delivered to you as the
beneficiary. I want you to know that the diplomats run a courier service
which is called DIPLOMATIC COURIER SERVICE, this service is meant for
transferring hard documents, huge funds and precious stones, and they call
it Consignment. This consignment will be registered under their service and
will be carried with their diplomatic immunity to any country where they
have diplomatic grounds and then deliver it to the owner of the consignment
on the grounds where they maintain diplomatic immunity.*

*In this case, the deal will go like this, once I register the consignment
in your name, I will seal it and then register it as a diplomatic
consignment Trunk Box to be delivered to the owner (which is you) in his
country. The Airplane that will airlift the consignment is the RED CROSS
JET which equally has the diplomatic immunity to lift such consignments and
other hard copies because of the nature of its work.*

*So Wherever the Red Cross Jet lands, then the diplomat will immediately
contact you and you will proceed to receive the consignment from him. It is
very simple and straight forward transaction as long as you follow my
instructions. You should understand that the Diplomats are very busy people
so they will not be able to tolerate delays, so you must have to be ready
so that as soon as they land and contact you, then you will be able to meet
with the diplomat immediately and claim your consignment.  If you cannot be
able to meet with him immediately due to your tight schedule, then you can
make further arrangements with him to assist you in bringing the
consignment to your home and he will surely help you as long as you follow
his directives.*

*I hope you have understood all about this business and how it is going to
be done. So for us to start up immediately, i will need the below
information's from you:*

*1, YOUR FULL NAME*
*2, YOUR CURRENT CONTACT ADDRESS/STATE OF ORIGIN*
*3, YOUR OCCUPATION AND POSITION*
*4, YOUR AGE*
*5, MARITAL STATUS*
*6, YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBERS*

*These information's will enable me prepare the necessary documents on your
behalf which will authenticate and legalize you the as the legitimate owner
of the consignment as required by law which will be used also to register
the consignment in your name. Once I am through with that, I will let you
know and I will also send you the copy of the AIRWAY BILL DOCUMENT which I
used in registering you as the owner of the funds for delivery.*

*I will also let you know the name and telephone numbers of the Diplomat to
enable you contact him once he arrives. This is the summary of the legal
process involved in this transaction so you can see that it is a straight
forward transaction. Like I said all I require from you is your absolute
trust, confidentiality and assurance that you will not abscond with the
fund when it eventually arrives your safe custody.*

*Finally, I will be updating you as we progress, Please treat this with
high level secrecy and urgency it deserves, I am counting on your
understanding while waiting for your urgent response to enable us proceed
immediately.*

*Regards,*
*Col. Marcus Luthan*
