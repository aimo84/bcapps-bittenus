Hello Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thank you for your prompt response. I'm Dr. Justin Krueger, A senior health
adviser to the United Nation and presently on a tour in Yemen military
community. I am a managing partner to an oil servicing firm with contract
in Iraq, Iran and Kuwait. I seek your consent and I want to know if you can
be trusted based on your profile.  I have some items that I would love to
ship to you because of my conflict of interest as a United Nation US
appointed official and as an active managing partner of an oil servicing
firm. I have $20million from oil proceed and deals in the gulf region where
I have been on a war tour between Iraq and Afghanistan. I will not want
such money traced into my account hence the need to contact you so you can
keep it save pending the end of my tour here; which last for another
2months. If you are interested and can help me then I can highlight more on
how much we will be sharing funds and how to ship them to you. Definitely
through a United Nation air ambulance or our cargo relief aircraft. All I
need is your acceptance and I will provide further information on shipment
and transaction. If you are interested please provide:

1. Your full name
2. Address where I can ship to
3. Telephone number
4. International Passport/ Driver's License

I hope this mail finds you in good health and give you the confidence to
accept this proposal that will change our life and that of the people
around us. I will send you my ID when I receive your required information.

Regards

Dr. Justin Krueger
