1.) Your full name: =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.
2.) Your occupation =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.
3.) The date of your birth: =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6..
4.) Your Private telephone: =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.=E2=80=A6and fax: =E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6=E2=80=A6.
5 ] Your Home address...........
=C2=A0
=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Base on this I will advise you to feel free all is well, I studied this transaction very well before contacting you for assistance. I have served this bank for so many years now and I deem it is necessary to utilize this opportunity of the present unclaimed sum of money in the account sent in-conjunction with the first proposal I sent to you to help myself and my family through the investment I will establish in your country with my percentage in the transaction.
=C2=A0
(a) Before the death of our deceased customer his true next of kin was not indicated to the board of directors of the bank because of the top secrecy and confidentiality of the transactions which our late customer transacted with the various governments in West Africa.
=C2=A0
(b) Owning to his failure to indicate his next of kin to the officials of the bank, it is therefore impossible for the board of directors of the bank to verify the next of kin as well as the true inheritor of the fund.
=C2=A0
(c) And for the above reasons the managements of the bank authorized me officially as the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of this bank to verify the next of kin to our deceased customer. Therefore, the bank will always abide by my official directions through the official authorization bestowed on me. And for this reasons you have nothing to fear as your interest and identity will be legally protected.
=C2=A0
More so, the only information required from you by the bank is your banking data as contained in the official application which I will give you to send to our bank after your immediate response because the receipt of your application is the commencement of the official process of this transaction.
=C2=A0
Now I will like to use this opportunity to tell you the detail information concerning our deceased customer. The deceased account holder with our bank was Mr. Moreau Petit, from France who naturalized here in Burkina Faso for (16) years. He held account number NBOA4934109, ROUTING No: 91002211 with our bank. He died in airline crash on 31st July 2005 with his family and his account has been dormant and nobody has applied to our bank for the release of this money to him or her as the next of kin.
=C2=A0
I have spent time and made all necessary enquirers to find out if I can get any of his relative so that they will come for the claims but to no avail. The banking ethics here doesn't allow the money to stay more than 7 years because the fund will be recalled to our bank's treasury as abandoned fund.
=C2=A0
I decided to contact you and use your name for the claim, as you are going to act as his business associate and we get the fund transferred into you account.=C2=A0 Honestly i have to let you know that i got your contact from the international directory, Of which i pray over it before i decided to contact on this email for an assistance towards my proposal so that it will help me and my family, because of the criticle=C2=A0 condition poor economies nature of my country.
=C2=A0
Many Banks here=C2=A0 use to confiscate a lot of foreigners money in there various Banks after the fund lying dormant for years. We Poor Bankers don=E2=80=99t gain anything if the fund is confiscated. I got this opportunity and decided to contact you, for the mutual benefit of our both families because I don=E2=80=99t want the money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund since nobody is coming for it.
=C2=A0
As the Director in charge of Auditing and Accounting section of this bank, I have studied this transaction very carefully and I have noted that there are no risks involved. I am here to protect all your interests in this transaction until this money hits your account. Since I am here I shall be giving you all the developmental information from the bank as soon as this transaction commence.
=C2=A0
I know that you will not disappoint me when this money enters your account, I have all my hope of life survival with my family in this transaction. We must hurry up with this transaction so that our bank and the government shall not claim and inherit this money because it has over-stayed.
=C2=A0
After the bank have approve your application as next of kin to our late customer I will fly down in your country for investment with my own share but I will advise you to keep this transaction as a top secret because no body again knows about it except you and I.
=C2=A0
For more you can cinformation=C2=A0ontact me on phone (+226 6529 2716 ) so that we can talk.
Thanks

Mr Zakaria Romaric
