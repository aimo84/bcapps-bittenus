Dear Sir, 

I acknowledge the receipt of your kind email message
today. 

I contacted you based on the request by an investor Mr. Arshad
Mustafa and his need for investment/funding in your company. My name is
Solicitor Cadona Martinez of St Luce and Associates here in London. 

My
company most times represents the interests of very wealthy investors
(HIGH NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS) Due to the sensitivity of the position they
hold in their society and the unstable investment environment of their
country, they evacuate majority of their funds into more stable
economies and developed nations where they can get good yield for their
funds. 

A reserved Client, whom I had personally worked with few years
ago with a proposal, recently, approached me that he wants an
individual/company that will assist him to invest the sum of
(USD500.000.000.00) Five Hundred Million USD in Bank Guaranty on his
behalf in a good profitable business in your company/country for a
period of 10 years for a start. Mr Arshad Mustafa has being diagnosed of
Lung Cancer and this has necessitated in his search for an investment
manager to stand as his next of Kin since he has no wife or children to
inherit his estate running into Millions of Dollars. 

You are required
to provide me with your complete information including your
international passport copy to enable me commence documentation between
you and my Client for the Liquidation of the Bank Guaranty valued for
USD 500million issued by Lloyds TSB Bank plc. 

The Investor also offers
you 30% for your assistance, 60% for him to be managed by you also for
10years and 10% will be set aside to cover re-payment of expenses
incurred in the liquidation / Investment process. The investor requires
a foundation opened in his name before he dies as the doctors say he has
less than 2 moths to live. This is a very legitimate transaction and all
required legal documents will be issued and sent to you for your
signature before the transaction is completed. 

We look forward to a
cordial business relationship with you and you can also call me on +
447438957048 for more details. 

Best regards. 

Solicitor Cadona
