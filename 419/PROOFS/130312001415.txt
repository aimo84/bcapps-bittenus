Good day,

Thank you for your response; We have to follow procedure to avoid arousing
the authorities. I sincerely appreciate your interest, to assist me however
I would like to be sure of your willingness, trustworthiness and commitment
to execute this transaction with me, I cannot afford to compromise these
virtues.

First, I must insist on your confidence in this transaction. I made this
contact with you based on reliable information available to me courtesy of
an agency that helps seek people by their email, and confirmed by my local
chambers of commerce and industry concerning your reputation. Thus I am
convinced you would be capable to provide me with a solution to a money
transfer transaction of US$10,200,000.00(Ten Million, Two Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars).

My client did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including
the paper work of his bank deposit. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to
you is that I would like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to
our client so that you will be able to receive his funds. I want you to
know that I have had everything planned out so that we can come out
successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary
document that will back you up as the next of kin to my client. All that is
required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with the details
below so that the attorney can commence his job:

1. Full names
2. Address
3. Age
4. Occupation
5. Telephone number / Fax Number

After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also file in
for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be
provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are
going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the
necessary documents. The allocation of our money will be as follows: 39.3
%( $4.08m) to you for your part in this, 55.7% for me and my partners and
5% for any unforeseeable expenses we may incur. I think this is extremely
fair, as you have nothing to lose but just a little time, while on the
other hand I am staking my flawless reputation among other things. And
besides $4.08 million is no pocket change. Once you are approved, the
entire transaction should take no longer than twelve business days after
which we will go about our daily business, but just millions of dollars
richer.

As you can see this is easier than taking candy from a baby, but mind you,
trust is something that is developed over time and that is something that
we do not have. So I have to let you know that it will highly unfeasible to
try to run away with the money because even though only you can transfer
money in and out of your account, my department of which I happen to be the
head can only authorize the transfer. The money will be transferred from my
bank to an account you will provide. So please, there should be no room for
greed because ten million two hundred thousand dollars can quench even the
most insatiable desire for the almighty dollar.

Furthermore, if you follow up this transaction diligently it would be
completed within 14 working days. What I expect from you is trust and
commitment; I want this large sum of money transferred with your
assistance. I want to know if you are willing to follow up this business
seriously before I can give you more details about this transaction, I
shall be waiting for your response and assurance.

Sincerely,
Mrs. Riza Perla
