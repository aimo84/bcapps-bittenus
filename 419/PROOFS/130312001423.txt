Thanks for your email and I am very happy on your willingness
and readiness to cooperate with me in the procedures to ensuring the smooth and
successful transfer of this family fund [18.5M] to your overseas nominated account
for a possible investment for the building of the cancer foundation and as I
indicated in my letter. I want to assure you that you will never regret
your decision to help my family in this project as every arrangement has been
concluded waiting for the right and serious partner; I want you to send to me
urgently your personal details and also a copy of your identification for the
release; memorandum of MOU agreement document.

 

Furthermore, I wish to inform you that we shall be
securing all the necessary documentations and approvals which will prevent your
government or bank from questioning you on the origin or source of fund.

 

Meanwhile, it might interest you to know that this
transaction will not exceed 7 working days to conclude if you follow my
instruction and advice. To proceed I will need from you urgently the following:

 

(1) A copy of your identity

(2) Your residential address

(3) Your occupation

(4) Your private telephone number and fax number(if available)

 

Once you provide the above information we shall commence with my attorney
drafting a memorandum of MOU agreement document which shall state categorically
the terms and conditions of this transaction but I want you to bear in mind
that we shall be working together in securing all the necessary documents to
facilitate the transfer of this fund in your name as inheritance fund for the
building of this cancer foundation in your country as I was informed that I
have few months to leave on this earth.

 

Also, I shall be giving a power of authority to
my attorney to work with you; my attorney's name is advocate Kelis Richards and
he promised to use the virtue power of his office to ensure the smooth and
successful transfer of this fund to the overseas nominated account you shall
provide for this purpose. You may as well contact him directly
on +27731339901 for clarifications on the procedures to be adopted.

 

Thanks in anticipation of your most urgent and positive response.

Regards and God Bless, 

Mrs. Sandra z. Davidson
