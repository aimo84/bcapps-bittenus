Dear Sir,

Thanks for your response=A0to my office and i do hope you are feeling fine in the best of health. However for better understanding on this foreign payment issues, i would like to throw more light into the real circumstance that led me to contact you over this unclaimed funds. I want you to understand that the funds totalling a sum of US$ 6 Million which was left unclaimed by an unknown beneficiary will be returned back to the treasury of the UNO/IMF compensation payment head office if no person comes forward to claim the funds. Like i told you earlier many other people in different countries of the world whose names were on the list of beneficiaries of this compensation payment have already received their funds from the paying bank which my office is responsible to add or subtitute names of all legal beneficiaries before final payment approval thereby making it possible for me to include your names on the list of certified funds beneficiaries. I want you
 to understand that my position here in United Kingdom provides me the opportunity to work as a payment processing offficer in this UNO/IMF compensation payment which makes it difficult for me to receieved the unclaimed funds myself because we are not allowed to operate a foreign bank account or to handle such huge amount of money while still on active service. Therefore i contacted you with trust beleiving that you will remain a honest and trusthworthy partner without any form of cheats or betrayal from you after receiving the funds from the paying bank because i will personally resign my appointment here in London and start coming over to meet you over there in your country for sharing the funds and for onward investment.

Be informed that i am still looking forward to receive your complete personal details and your bank account information which will be forwarded to the UNO/IMF compensation payment head office in London and also to the paying bank which is the Barclays Bank Plc London.=A0 After receiving your information, all the vital documents will be ready on your name within 2 or 3 days and i will be sending you copies of those documents through email attachement as soon as i received the documents from the UNO/IMF compensation payment head office here in United Kingdom. My duty here is to protect your interest always while you are standing as the beneficiary of the funds, Therefore i want you to make up your mind now by removing every doubts or fears you may be having about this transaction because there is absolutely NO risk involved in it. I will never indulge in any risky transaction with my position here in United Kingdom because my reputation is placed above
 every other thing. I do not know the economic situation in your country but i would personally need your advise and directives to invest my own share of this funds when i meet you in person over there in your country after concluding this transaction successful. Therefore i want you to compile immediately and send to me your personal details and your bank account information such as:=20
