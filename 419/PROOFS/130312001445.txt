Dear Leonard

Please kindly accept my apology for sending unsolicited mail to you. I am contacting you concerning a deceased customer John Zeptowitz=2C and an investment he placed under our banks management 3years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail.

In 2010 the subject matter came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our Trustee and Depository Institutional Fund Services division NATWEST BANK. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of #3.5 million pounds=2C which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf.

I was the officer assigned to his account=2C and based on my advice=2C We spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first months of operation=2C

I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the latter and had the funds deposited with a security consultancy firm. This security firm is a specially private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash.

In Line with instructions=2C the money was deposited with them. He told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication we had=2Cthis transpired around 25th February 2011.

I was the only one who knew about the deposit at the security company=2C and I could not understand why our client had not come forward to claim his deposit. I made futile efforts to locate him=2C and immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of of my bank.Four days later=2C information started to trickle in=2C apparently our man was dead.

A person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Canne=2C South of France.

We were soon enough able to confirm all of this including cause of death. The bank immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his estate.

If you are familiar with private banking affairs=2C those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity=2C but also some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form=2C he listed no next of kin. opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence=2C accounts are rarely held under a name=3B depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. It is quite clear now that our dear fellow died with no known or identifiable family members.

This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice=2C the security company will by the end of AUGUST 2013=2C broadcast a request for statements of claim to NATWEST BANK=2C failing to receive viable claims they will most probably revert the deposit to NATWEST BANK. This will result in the money entering the NATWEST BANK accounting system.

What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something.There is #3.8 MILLION Pounds deposited in a security company. I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so.

This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track this man'sfamily=3B they have investigated for months and have found no family. The investigation has come to an end.

My proposal=3B you share similar details to the late fellow=3B I am prepared to instruct the security company to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit=2C I am prepared to share the money with you in half.

I will simply inform the bank of the final closing of the file relating to our late client. I will then officially communicate with the security company and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: all is done.

I ask that you do not destroy my chance=2C if you will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do not destroy me.

I am a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportunities.I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank.

Please=2C again=2C note I am a family man=2C I have  children. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences=2C but I know within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients.

Do not betray my confidence.

Sincerely=2C

Mr Ingram=20
