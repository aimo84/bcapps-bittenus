Hello=2CLet me take time out to explain the whole process of this transaction to you=2C please be patient to read and understand it=2C if you have any questions=2C let me know. I will state the very crucial issues here so you can understand clearly what we are going to do in this business. These details are for you to understand this intended project. In everything one does with another=2C there must be a meeting of minds. Without us both seeing and assessing the situation through the same lenses there cannot and will never be success or progress. So as we say here =93thoroughness is what is needed here". I need you to follow and adhere to my every instruction and do exactly as I will advice for success to be gained. You must let me direct this project for us to achieve step by step the anticipated procedures to ensure the success=2C this is not negotiable my friend as we go into partnership. It is when there is no leadership and no meeting of minds that there are problems in partnership like this. Everything is going to be done in sequence and I imagine that the whole process should take about 2 weeks before money will be in your account or if you want to be paid by cashier=92s cheque=2C the choice of mode of payment would be yours. At this stage I have exclusive access to the files of Late Hubert=2C I will be instructing a solicitor in South Africa whom I have initially contacted to prepare all the documents in your name i.e. Affidavit of testament of WILL including probate letters stating you as beneficiary as well as next of kin and sole executor to his estate (which includes cash). This will then be put in late Hubert's file and presented to my bank for verification and immediate action. Based on my ground work=2C the funds transfer to you will be approved and then authorization given to the Chase Private Bank to make payment to you. Please this is very important and your total commitment is what is desired and most communication will be done via this email address for extreme confidential reasons. At this stage I will welcome any questions you have to ask so you understand totally the seriousness of our project so feel free to ask any further question you want=2C if you want clarification in your return email. We are going to take this matter on a step-by-step basis. However something that I must point out to you at this stage is that there is no wrong on your part. At the end of the day it is the First National Bank South Africa and the Chase Private Bank South Africa that will be contacting you to inform you that money has been left for you. You are not making the contact with the bank so you are doing absolutely nothing wrong or taking any risk. The only person who could have disputed this is Hubert and he is long gone. You must understand why there must be serious confidentiality about this whole process. Chase Private Bank South Africa is a specialist bank=2C which deals with high net worth individuals and giant corporations. I have my contact there to make sure that nothing goes wrong. As soon as First National Bank South Africa has gone through all formalities with verification of documents I put in the file=2C these verifications are required by law to be done but be sure all have been covered=2C after which they will instruct Chase Private Bank to make payments to you. You shall be required to reconfirm to me some important details which will be needed for the documentation process and the documentation process has to contain your correct and exact details. As soon as I have made the necessary amendments you will become the legal beneficiary and as First National Bank will be getting in touch with you.The information needed is to ensure that the documentation corresponds with those I will put in Hubert=92s file which should also correspond with the time Hubert gave the instructions for the transfer of the money from the as First National Bank to the Chase Private Bank in 2002. Please provide the following information=3B (1) FULL NAMES:(2) YEAR OF BIRTH:(3) TELEPHONE NUMBER(4) FAX NUMBER (IF ANY)(5) COMPANY NAME (IF ANY)(6) ANY OTHER IMPORTANT DETAILS ABOUT YOU (LINE OF WORK) My friend please let us be positive and show discretion as we both make one of the most fruitful steps of our lives.Regards=2CLowe Chan
