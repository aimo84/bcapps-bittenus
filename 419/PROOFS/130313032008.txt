  Good Day

I wish to introduce myself to you, I am Mr. John Galvan a staff of a
private offshore bank (Aig Private Bank) United Kingdom office. I am the
head of the Accounts Department. I am pleased to get across to you for a
very urgent and profitable business proposal which I believe will profit
the both of us after completion. I contacted you after a careful thought
that you might be capable of handling this business transaction, which I
will explain Below. The sum of  (=A315,500,000.00 Million Pounds) is floating
unclaimed in my bank as all efforts to get across to the relatives of our
client who deposited the money have hit the stones.

There is this client Mr. Roger Ian Wright a US businessman, founder of a
Sao Paulo-based investment company. On the 22nd of May 2009, Mr. Roger Ian
Wright, his wife and his two children all died in a King Air B350 plane
crash seaside resort town of Trancoso, in the state of Bahia. You can find
below the links pertaining to this accident.

All attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. My position here at
my office requires me to investigate and I therefore made further
investigations and discovered that Mr. Roger Ian Wright did not declare any
next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including his bank
deposit paperwork in my bank. According to the British Law the money will
revert to the ownership of the British government if nobody applies to
claim the fund. To prevent this from happening I have decided to seek your
assistance to have you stand as his next of kin so that the said fund
(=A315,500,000.00 Million Pounds), would be released in your name as the next
of kin and paid into your account. All documents and proof that will have
you claim this fund without stress will be forwarded to you upon your
response to this mail.

I intend to give 40% of the total funds as compensation for your
assistance. I will notify you on the full transaction on receipt of your
response if interested, and I shall send you the details and necessary
procedures with which to make the transfer. Please send me your:

1. Full names
2. Private phone number
3. Current residential address
4. Occupation

I hope your response indicates a good beginning for something important to
come.
Kind Regards,
Mr. John Galvan.
