Hello,

Thanks for your benevolent response. Please accept my sincere apologies for
the late response, As we have restricted access to Internet and phone calls
here.I appreciate your concern and I'll include your welfare in my daily
prayers. I want you to bear in mind that I mean well for both of us and
would like us to trust and co-operate with each other so that we can finish
the transaction successfully. The Finance company promised to make
arrangements for the legal documents that will back up the transaction.

For your humble assistance, I am willing give you $600.000.00 us dollars,
As I do not want to loose my money to the Finance company because i have
worked so hard to safeguard it for the past yrs. The deposit tenure has
already expired Six Months ago and the company is threatening to confiscate
the money as unclaimed funds if i fail to present a beneficiary before this
month runs out. I don't anticipate any fees as i have already made all the
payments.

 I am presently in U.S Military hospital. Landstuhl Regional Medical Center
in Germany. Recovering from injuries sustained in a suicide bomb attack.
Considering my present condition here in the hospital, I'll not be able to
do much from here, that's the main reason why I want you to handle this
transaction on my behalf. Its better i give you that amount than loosing
the whole money to the company, so don't  worried. Attached is my  pics and
my id for your viewing and confirmation.

All I want from you is to present you to the company as my Associate and
beneficiary, so that the money will be transferred to your bank account.
Then when I'm discharged from here, I'll come over and take my share of the
money while you keep the rest as I promised.

I need you to send me your contact information such as Your Full name, Home
address, phone numbers and any form of identification for my viewing and
confirmation too. I know you understand why I need to view your ID.

  As soon as I receive the ID, i will authorised the company to deal with
you directly, as my beneficiary. I will also send the security code of my
deposited funds to you so that you can contact them as my Associate
requesting that my deposited money be processed and transferred to you
immediately.

I hope you completely understand my email. Please feel free to ask anything
which is not clear to you so that i can clarify everything before we
proceed. I'll be waiting for your immediate response. Thanks and God bless
you.

Warm regards,

Sgt. Angelica Johnson.
