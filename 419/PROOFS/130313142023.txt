Thanks for your swift response. My mail to you was written
as a matter requiring expediency because of the very peculiar
circumstance surrounding this claim. Brian Zeptowitz died at 54 and I
have since carried out a thorough search on his actual extended family
ties here in the UK and my efforts have been to no avail hence
contacting you.

Late Brian passed away at 54yrs old, alongside his wife
46, and their only daughter, 22; he also made me to understand that he
had relatives in Canadian region which is why I have limited my search
for possible relatives to that region. I contacted you to solicit your
assistance in re profiling funds belonging to my late client although
you may not be directly related to him but the circumstances surrounding
this claim has necessitated this immediate communication.

Brian lived
most of his years in the UK but travelled often. I served as his private
attorney for the last six years preceding his death and I had known him
a little while before then. I knew his father to be Late Joel Zeptowitz
although I never had the opportunity to meet him in person. I contacted
you because upon the death of my late client, I was informed by the
financial institution where he held this deposit to search for any
member of his extended family to put up a claim or who could be so
represented as managers or trustees to his deposited funds with them
which stands at over Â£3.8 million British Pounds. 

I also gathered
information from directors of the financial institution suggesting a
likely proceeding for the confiscation of these abandoned personal
assets in line with existing laws since nobody is coming forth for them
and I do not want this happening. However, it might interest you to know
that after a thorough investigation in the financial institution, I
found out that some members of the company are currently planning to
divert this funds in their selfish interest and only want to use the
excuse that since I was not able to look for someone to make the claim,
the money should be made un -serviceable and that means reverting the
funds to the Government while the company retains a percentage of it.

It might also interest you to know that late Brian always wanted to
establish a charity home assisting the fatherless and maybe you can help
him actualise this dream after you have secure his abandoned estate with
the financial institution.

I have within my exclusive custody secured
deposit documents evidencing this deposit which is so far inaccessible
to the institution or any other person(s). To this extent and with your
consent will like to put you forward as a relative/beneficiary to late
Brian's estate.

I can be contacted on +447700051613 so we can discuss
extensively. 

Regards,

Graham Bartlett
