Please,start writing me through this my private e-mail address only ( jamesbuka87@yahoo.com=0A ) for privacy reason and quick response. At first, I must assure you =0Athat this business is risk and trouble free. There will be complete =0Adocuments of transaction which will prove to your bank or its =0Acorrespondence that the money going into your account is genuine, not a =0Adrug money or money laundering.You don't need to send your bank account =0Adetails anymore because online fund transfer is the best and fastest =0Ameans to transfer this fund to you according to the banking policy of =0A2013.
Please, keep this transaction to your self alone as top secret =0Abecause success of this business is highly confidential. Do not inform =0Ayour bank or anybody about the fund for now because they can start =0Aasking you early question that you may not be=0A able to asnwer. I will tell you the right time to inform them after I =0Amust have processed all the relevant documents to back up the fund,so =0Athey could know quite well that money going into your account is clean =0Afrom genuine source.
=C2=A0
We have made all the necessary arrangement =0Awith top director of the bank and he has instructed bank account officer=0A to setup offshore online bank account for you and subsequently credit =0Ait with the whole fund, after which he would send you the offshore =0Aonline bank account information which will enable you log in the account=0A and start transferring the fund bit by bit from your online bank =0Aaccount to any bank account of your choice anywhere in the world.
=C2=A0
Kindly,=0A send the below information to enable me draft application for payment =0Aand forward it directly to the Foreign Payment Officer of the bank for =0Aapproval of the fund on your name first, so as to proceed with =0Aprocessing of the offshore online bank=0A account.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
1.) Your Age and profession, company=E2=80=99s name and position if any...................
=C2=A0
2.) Marital status......................
=C2=A0
3.) Phone numbers, home office and mobile.....................
4.) A copy of your identification document such as international passport or driver's license via e-mail attachment
=C2=A0
Upon=0A receipt of the above information, I will quickly proceed with =0Aprocessing of the payment on your name via online fund transfer and the =0Abank will send you online bank account opening form to fill, sign and =0Asend back to them to facilitate the opening of the account.
=C2=A0
I contacted you for this important business as a total stranger due to the great need to involve a foreigner=0A who will act and receive this fund, the account belongs to a foreigner =0Awho died without a WILL. Meanwhile, I will like to let you know that Mr =0ARoger Abdelfattah have mining industries in Ghana ,=0A and also engage himself to many businesses before he died. I promise =0Ayou that we will make difference if you can only follow my instruction =0Awhich I will be getting from the Bank head vetting officer who is the =0Amain KEY to success of this business.
=C2=A0
The management of the bank=0A is ready to pay the money to any foreigner who has correct information =0Aabout the account which I will GIVE to you along with all the LEGAL =0ADOCUMENTS needed by the management of the bank, and with the help of a =0Atop official of the bank who is deeply involved in this business. =0AEverything will work out fine. But my only worry is the security and =0Asafety of this fund once transferred to you=C2=A0 as we have not known =0Abefore, and I do not know any foreigner and the bank management will =0Anever approve the fund to a local account or indigenous name. We also =0Ahave a strict banking policy which does not allow citizens of my country=0A to transfer funds out to abroad but a foreigner has=0A unlimited right to transfer funds.
