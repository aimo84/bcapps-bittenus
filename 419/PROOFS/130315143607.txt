Hello Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thanks for your quick response, i also appreciate your interest and willingness to help actualize this transaction.I wish to let you know that this is a bank-to-bank transfer, I also want you to know that the management of my bank must not know that I'm involved in this transaction.i contacted you so that we can work together with oneness and with your full co-operation the fund will be released in your name. I'm a God fearing person and I'm a Christian, also I want you to be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free,

To clarify you more on the source of the fund. The said fund is the over budgeted funds which the government want to use to pay a particular foreign contractors who executed contract with the Government in building one of the Stadium for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. I have kept this fund in an escrow coded account until this date. Since there was no any trace, i now decided to transfer the fund out of England for our benefit. I wish to inform you that this transaction has been packaged in a professional way to benefit all of us both the involves the Finance Minister of South Africa, the Accountant General and the Project management / Contract Award Committee Chairman of South Africa. i do not have a foreign bank account where this fund can be transferred and I as a banker can not claim the fund as the owner.

For this reason i have to seek for your assistance to stand as the owner and the fund will be transferred into your provided account. All I require from you is your maximum co-operation as the fund is to be transferred telegraphically from our Head office situated at the Capital City of London England. I only require your info which is very important for this deal to proceed

Full Names;
Company Name if Any:
Full Address;
Date of birth;
Occupation;

Telephone Number/Cellphone Number

The above required information will be programmed in our bank network computer database system as a particular foreign contractors who executed contract with the Government in building one of the Stadium for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. i will also guide you, as you will apply from our Head office where the fund will be further transferred to your designated bank account. immediately I received the above information of yours I will prepare all the necessary document in your name, as my head office might request for such document at the process of transferring the fund to your bank account.

After the successful transfer of the fund,I will come over to meet you in your country, or any country where you want us to meet for sharing according to already mapped out percentage. i will expect the above information as soon as possible.
