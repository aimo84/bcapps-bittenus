Hello Friend ,

This is a life time opportunity and =0A100% legitimate. We quite understand you might be skeptical about this =0Amessage due to the rapid of false organization in the internet, so =0Abecause of that my wife and I decided to make it known to the world by =0Apublishing it on the news. However, Violet my wife and I have decided to=0A make sure this is put on the internet for the world to see and to ease =0Ayour skepticism. For so doing you do not need to be skeptical about this=0A donation to you. My wife had cancer and as you could see from the =0Awebpage, am not getting any younger and you can imagine having no kids =0Aat this age. You see after taken care of the needs of our immediate =0Afamily members, we decided to donate the remaining of the $11Million to =0Aother individuals around the world in need, the local fire department, =0Athe Red Cross, Haiti,=0A hospitals in Truro where Violet underwent her cancer treatment, and =0Asome other organizations in Asia and Europe that fight cancer, =0AAlzheimer's and diabetes and the bulk of the funds deposited with =0ASANTANDER BANK PLC, the payout bank of this charity donation. We have =0Akept just 2% of the entire lottery sum to our self for the raining day.

To=0A facilitate the disbursement process of the funds [ $500,000.00 USD ] =0Awhich have been donated solely to you, please send us your contact =0Aaddress, phone number and a Valid Identification(i.e either Driver's =0ALicense/International Passport of yours) so that we can forward your =0Adetails over to the payout bank. We are hoping that you will be able to =0Ause the money wisely and judiciously over there in your country. We will=0A employ you to do what you can to alleviate the level of poverty in your=0A region and also try to enhance the standard of living of as many people=0A as you can because that is the only objective of=0A donating this money to you in the first place.

I like to =0Are-assure you of the legitimacy of this Services as we will not be =0Ainvolved in any fraudulent act and will never be. We will advise as you =0Aas the "Sole Beneficiary" to be calm not to loose this great opportunity=0A which millions of people are trying to entangled but the chances just =0Acouldn't come for them because a lot of people are out there to =0Adiscourage them as they don't know how it works, and have never seen =0Asuch before.

Sorry to inform you that I lost my wife last year =0Adue to cancer illness, though we started the drive of donating the fund =0Abut unfortunately i lost her along the line. And i am left alone to do =0Athis, but her memory still lives in me. so just try and get this =0Adonation soonest because no body knows tomorrow as i am not getting =0Ayounger everyday.

Thank you for accepting our offer, we are indeed grateful.

God Bless You
Allen and Violet=0A Large
