Dear Friend,=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0AThank you for giving me your time, it is of great importance for you to understand every word which I have written down below; please be patient and read the explanation in my email. I am Mrs.Eugenia xing Chao , a staff of standard chartered Bank Plc here in Singapore with an attachment in Private Banking Services, I am contacting you concerning a customer and an investment placed under our bank management; as a matter of fact it was 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail very confidential and also to kindly respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of our correspondence. I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0AIn 2008, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/958/042/0500 came to our bank to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 14.37 million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over (invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, and I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers, as well as 200 managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our first
 months of operation with the accrued profit and interest included, the figure at this point stood at over $15.2 million United States Dollars, and this margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments.=0A=C2=A0 =0AIn mid 2009, he asked that the money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the funds and have it deposited with a firm in Europe. I informed him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for the banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11 and I contacted my affiliates to make the funds available in mainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instructions to the letter after which I had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accepts
 deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate access to cash.=C2=A0 This small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organizations. In line with his instructions, the money was deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Denmark later that week. This was the last communication we had, and this transpired around February 25th 2011. In June last year, we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that particular portfolio. This was an astounding situation as far as I was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking sector and I was the only one who knew about the deposit, I could not understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0AI made futile efforts to locate him, I infact immediately passed the task of locating him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days later, information started to trickle in that he was apparently dead, a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart attack in Boulogne, North=C2=A0 of France; we were soon able to gather more information about the cause of his death. The bank immediately launched an investigation into a possible surviving next of kin to alert him of coming forward to claim the deceased estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also with some levels of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the
 accounts anonymous.=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0A=C2=A0This bank also gives the choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care, in this case; he died Intestate.=0AIn line with our internal processes for account holders who have passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to determine who should have right to claim the estate, this investigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to get to the root of the situation. It is this investigation that resulted in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you as a foreigner, and as a potential benefactor of the estate, even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the deceased). My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results of the investigation. I have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known or identifiable family member, and this leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the prevailing situation is in relation to the
 deposit and the late beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm shall by the end of may this year broadcast a request for statements of claim to our bank, and if they fail to receive viable claims, they will most probably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the money being transferred into our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department. This will not happen if I have my way. =0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0AWhat I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice but I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the banking world that finds the internal politics of the banking world aberrational. The world of private banking is especially fraught with huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. There is $13,991,674(Thirteen million, nine hundred and ninety one thousand, six hundred and seventy four united states dollars) deposited, I alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of this deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the portfolio are just customer services and due
 processes. The finance firm has no idea of the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes forward, and this is the current situation. Our bank has spent great amount of money trying to track the family of the deceased; they have also investigated for months and have found no member of his family or possible next of kin, hence the investigation has officially come to an end.=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0AMy proposal; I am prepared to place you in a position whereby an instruction is given to the finance firm to officially release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation/associate, and all etiquette shall be done in accordance with the rule of law, I certainly can guarantee you that. By common law, the power of bequeathing is coeval with the first rudiments of the law, and this power extends to all of a man's Personal/Real estate. There is no ruling which prevents an inheritance from being so exhausted by legacies as to render it unworthy of the heir's acceptance; basically all persons of a sound mind are competent to bequeath and devise a personal real estate, except infants,=C2=A0 and with all this said, I would say we have the clear advantage to carry out a smooth and perfect operation whereby the paper work shall be well coordinated in such a way that your status as a sole beneficiary is confirmed. Upon your receipt of the deposit, I am
 prepared to share the money with you in half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the proceeds 50/50.=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0AI would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to me directly, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as an indifferent foreigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the file relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you; with these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account holder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving the money directly from the firm. We can fine-tune this based on our subsequent interaction, I am aware of the consequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest in this project, you should
 discard this email. I ask also, that you do not be vindictive or destructive of my personality and career, if my offer is of no appeal to you, please delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; once again, please not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. =0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0AYou may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of comparable situations like this run the private banking sector, I am not a criminal and what am about to do, I do find unparallel to good conscience, this may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you understand, because for once I find myself in total control and face to face with my destiny. I ask that you do not destroy my chance, if you will not work with me please let me know, so I can move on with my life, but do not destroy me; I am a family woman and this is a rare occasion to provide them with a better future. There is a reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only
 one who knows of this situation, good fortune will bless you and plant you into the center of relevance in my life, let=E2=80=99s share this blessing.=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0AIf you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me specifically,if you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a quick conclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition should you contact me via my official channels; I will simply deny knowing you or about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my official lines or my official email account. Contact me only through this email address; I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are not secure lines as they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line with our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this instruction religiously.=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0APlease, again, note I am a family woman; I am happily married with kids, I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what the consequences might be, but I knowing within me that nothing ventured is nothing gained, and that success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private banking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord I shall have the pleasure of meeting you after this task has been completed.=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0AI await your response=0A=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =0ASincerely,=0AMrs.Eugenia Chao
