Dear leonard.

I have just arrived back from a journey with my =0Amen and i read your message. Thanks so much for your concern and going =0Athrough my message. There is good news=A0 and i have to let you know about=0A it immediately because there can be no friendship without confidence =0Aand i believe that friendship is the inexpressible comfort of feeling =0Asafe with a good friend having neither to weigh of thoughts nor measure =0Awords. Please my dear, i will like you to keep it to yourself, I mean =0Alet it be a secret between both of us. Now listen, based on the site =0Awhich i showed you and you have rightly informed me that you have gone =0Athrough it which occurred on 13th January 2012.When i was searching with=0A my men after the unexpected crash of the ship,As a Captain i was =0Aassigned to conduct a search in the ship with my Men.So we proceed to =0Aunderground and as i commenced search under close guard by 2 soldiers, I=0A discovered an unusual bulge in a cellar, which I presumed to be storage=0A room in the ship and as we forced it open to have a closer look at it, I=0A kicked a metal covering it and found a metal box locked with a padlock.

On=0A forcing the box open, we discovered a lot of ornaments and old =0Adocuments at the first layer of the box and to my greatest amazement, =0Athe second layer was filled with money in Us dollar bills and it is the =0Afirst time this kind of occasion is taking place here=A0 because most of =0Athe Italian keep most of their money with them while traveling for =0Abusiness like purchasing of arms which they use for destroying peoples =0Alives and properties. We quickly counted the money in bundles and it =0Aamounted to US 2.6million. We decided to take it as our share for the =0Astress here=A0 so as to help establish ourselves when we return soon. I =0Aquickly sealed the box and at about 0500hrs when we are out from there, i=0A went immediately and deposited the box with the RED CROSS office =0Ainforming them that it contains personal security documents of someone =0Awhich i intend to send to him. So now the Red Cross office is waiting =0Afor me to present the owner so that the box can be delivered to the =0Aperson immediately. The Red Cross is not aware of the true contents of =0Athe box because i told them it contains only personal security documents=0A and it is safe in their hands.

So after several discussion with =0Amy men this morning, I told them about you and how i got your email =0Aaddress so we agreed to inform you about it and also to plead your =0Aconsent to help us to present you as the owner of the box so that the =0Abox will be delivered to you by the Red Cross Diplomat to your country =0Aas the owner.=A0 I will simply inform the Red Cross that you are the owner=0A and it will be delivered to you in your country. This is the greatest =0Aopportunity that i have now to start a new and peaceful life with you as=0A i want to stop this Job.

=A0I am THE HEAD of my command of the unit here so i =0Ahave 100% authentic means of moving the funds to you in your country =0Athrough the Red Cross diplomatic means so there is nothing to worry as =0Ait is a straight forward delivery to you in your country and 100% risk =0Afree. We have agreed to give you 30% of the total money when you receive=0A it under your safe custody while you keep 70% for me and my men until i=0A come over to meet with you when we are out of the military base soon. =0ARemember the key elements in the art of working together are how to deal=0A with change and how to reach our potential and when two are of one =0Amind, their strength can cut gold. I will detail you on the modalities =0Afor the delivery in my next mail when i receive your mail. Trust and =0Ahonesty is the investment i put in you. I count on your understanding.

Greetings from Italy

James Brynes.
