Hello=2C=20
Very warm greetings to you .I guess your letter indicates you are partially willing to proceed with the transaction=2C god will bless you. It is a great responsibility I am entrusting to you=2C not exactly luck as you my think.It is true that I am willing to put under your control the money=2C we have never meet=2C but if you are capable of handling this transaction I would proceed. To me it does not matter who controls the transaction=2C all I want is the assurance that the money will be used to help humanity=2C I would explain further later on as we proceed=2C why I told this decision.=20
Like I made mentioned in my previous message I am a very sick woman and I would like to help less fortunate ones with my funds deposited in Europe. I should have all the powers to do what I choose with the money since it is in my name=2C the reason why this is no longer possible is that I am bed ridden because of my illness=2C I need assistance to perform all regular functions=2C hence I contacted you. Prior to now I gave my extended family members access to some of my funds available here=2C to help distribute it to charity=2C bearing in mind that I do not have any child of mine=2C my family believed or made belief or out  of greed claimed that I had mental illness to think of such an act of charity=2C and refused to do as I told them=2C they shared the money among themselves. After doing some late night thinking and self analysis of my limitations and my so called family member around waiting that I pass away=2C I decided to contact you=2C to act as beneficiary to the deposit so that the funds would be distributed by you. I am of sound mind=2C contrary to what my family think or make belief out of greed.=20
=20
See=2C my husband and I spent all our life accumulating wealth=2C now=2C giving a second change I will not follow that path=2C all the money we made can not bring back my failing health. My doctor says I have very little time to live here on earth=2C but I would die happy knowing that my last days were used purely for good. I am not trying to buy my way into heaven by this act=2C no far be it from that=2C I believe in God so I am not afraid of death=2C my decision is based on administration and the productive power of my family members towards me and my decision=2C I positively know they would misuse or rather enjoy this money if the ever hear of it. I do not need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health=2C and because of the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I do not want them to know about this development.I am in pain daily and know that life is short for me=2C but=2C I prefer to trust you to help carry out my will in regards to using the funds positively
