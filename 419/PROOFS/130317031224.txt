Beloved,

Greetings to you in the name of our creator, Joy will be in your heart as
you are reading my email, I also pray you will have sense of direction, if
really you are the chosen one to assist me in this my last days.

I really thank you for your email, today I was a little bit strong to check
my email, sometimes I stay over weeks without checking it, but am so happy
that someone like you will always make me to check my emails since you will
be the only person that will be writing me.

Presently now, I am undergoing treatment as the doctor said I have limited
time to spend on earth. My dear friend, I don=92t want you to feel pity for
me, all I want is your prayer that God should heal me or accept my soul, I
decided to distribute the estate of my late Husband to the less privilege,
charity organization and motherless and fatherless children.

I always pray to God to direct a honest and God fearing person who will be
faithful to carry on this project as I have instructed, Please, if you are
interested in this money for your own selfish interest, do not reply me
back, I don=92t need someone like you, if you are humble and trusted, and can
assure me that you will be able to do all this which I have stated in my
letter to you, I will be happy to direct you to my personal lawyer who will
guide you through the release of the fund from the financial firm where the
fund is deposited for immediate release of the deposit to you.

I will be going through serious of attention with the doctor tomorrow, so
 will not be able to write you email until evening, always put me in your
daily prayer, I wish I will be able to talk to you on phone now, but I will
let you know when as soon as my doctor gives me a chance to do so because I
was asked not to use the telephone close to the medical equipment although
I will try to speak to my doctor on the need to speak with you, so i will
advice you send  me your telephone number so i can try to reach you as soon
as i can..

Thanks for reading from me and I await your reply back.

Best regards,
Mrs Laura Williams.
