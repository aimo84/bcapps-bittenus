Hello My Dearest One,

How are you today? hope fine, Do not be =0Asurprise or get offended for receiving this message from me, It's just =0Athat I have been obliged to lay a more trust on you due to my situation =0Ahere in the refugees camp, first of all i revealed my self to you, and I=0A will require the best of your honesty after your knowing about me and =0Awhom i am, I will really like us to have a good relationship inspire of =0Aanything because I have this feeling that you are my life and you will =0Anot betray me.

My dear like i told you in my first mail my name =0Ais lizy=A0 Falli I'm 24, from=A0 Sudan in=A0 Africa , 5.fit tall, Fair in =0Acomplexion,(never married before) and presently i am residing in the =0Arefugee camp here in Dakar as a result of the civil war that was fought =0Ain my country.

My late father Late Dr Banabas M Falli was the =0Apersonal=0A advicer to the former head of state before the rebels attacked our =0Ahouse one early morning and killed my mother and my father in cold =0Ablood.It was only me that is alive now and I managed to make my way to a=0A near by country Senegal where i am living now in a refugee camp.
My =0Adearest, In this refugee we are only allowed to go out two times in a =0Aweek.Its just like one staying in the prison and i hope by Gods grace i =0Awill come out from here soon.

I don't have any relatives now whom=0A i can go to, all my relatives ran away in the middle of the war the =0Aonly person i have now is=A0 (Rev.John Ken) who is the pastor of the =0A(Living Christian Church) here in the refugee he has been very nice to =0Ame since i came here but i am not living with him rather i am leaving in=0A the woman's hostel because the refugee have two hostels one for men the=0A other for women.

The Pastors Tel number is ( +221-764737859 ) if=0A you call tell him that you want to speak with=0A me he will send for me in the hostel, as a refugee here i don't have =0Aany right or privilege to any thing be it money or whatever because it =0Ais against the law of this country.I want to futher my studies because i=0A only attended my first year before the tragic incident lead to my being=0A in this situation now took place.

Please listen to this,i have =0Amy late father's deposit certificate and death certificate here with me =0Awhich i will send to you latter, because when my father was alive he =0Adeposited some amount of money in a leading Bank in which he used my =0Aname as the next of kin, the amount in question is $7.3 M(seven Million =0Athree Hundred Thousand Dollars)
so i will like you to help me =0Atransfer this money to your account and from it you can send some money =0Afor me to get my traveling documents and air ticket to come over to meet=0A with you, I kept this secret to people in the refugee here, the only =0Aperson that knows about it is the Reverend because=0A he is like a father to me.

So in the light of above i will like =0Ayou to keep it to yourself and don't tell it to anyone for i am afraid =0Aof loosing my life and the money if people gets to know about it, =0Aremember i am giving you all this information due to the trust i deposed=0A on you, I like honest and understanding people, truthful and a man of =0Avision, truth and hardworking, fluently Meanwhile i will like you to =0Acall me like i said i have a lot to tell you.

here is my space.

How do you see life:

Dearest=0A i want you to know that age or distant doesn't matter anything but love=0A matters a lot of things, i would like to know more about you, your =0Alikes and dislikes, your hobbies and what you are doing presently, I =0Awill tell you more about myself in my next mail, Attached here is my =0Apicture, i like to see yours, hoping to hear from=0A you soon.
