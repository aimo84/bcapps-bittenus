Dear Leonard Zeptowitz,
=C2=A0
Please,start writing me through this my private e-mail address only ( jamesbuka87@yahoo.com ) for privacy reason and quick response. At first, I must assure you that this business is risk and trouble free. There will be complete documents of transaction which will prove to your bank or its correspondence that the money going into your account is genuine, not a drug money or money laundering.You don't need to send your bank account details anymore because online fund transfer is the best and fastest means to transfer this fund to you according to the banking policy of 2013.

Please, keep this transaction to your self alone as top secret because success of this business is highly confidential. Do not inform your bank or anybody about the fund for now because they can start asking you early question that you may not be able to asnwer. I will tell you the right time to inform them after I must have processed all the relevant documents to back up the fund,so they could know quite well that money going into your account is clean from genuine source.
=C2=A0
We have made all the necessary arrangement with top director of the bank and he has instructed bank account officer to setup offshore online bank account for you and subsequently credit it with the whole fund, after which he would send you the offshore online bank account information which will enable you log in the account and start transferring the fund bit by bit from your online bank account to any bank account of your choice anywhere in the world.
=C2=A0
Kindly, send the below information to enable me draft application for payment and forward it directly to the Foreign Payment Officer of the bank for approval of the fund on your name first, so as to proceed with processing of the offshore online bank account.
=C2=A0
=C2=A0
1.) Your Age and profession, company=E2=80=99s name and position if any...................
=C2=A0
2.) Marital status......................
=C2=A0
3.) Phone numbers, home office and mobile.....................
4.) A copy of your identification document such as international passport or driver's license via e-mail attachment
=C2=A0
Upon receipt of the above information, I will quickly proceed with processing of the payment on your name via online fund transfer and the bank will send you online bank account opening form to fill, sign and send back to them to facilitate the opening of the account.
=C2=A0
I contacted you for this important business as a total stranger due to the great need to involve a foreigner who will act and receive this fund, the account belongs to a foreigner who died without a WILL. Meanwhile, I will like to let you know that Mr Roger Abdelfattah have mining industries in Ghana , and also engage himself to many businesses before he died. I promise you that we will make difference if you can only follow my instruction which I will be getting from the Bank head vetting officer who is the main KEY to success of this business.
=C2=A0
The management of the bank is ready to pay the money to any foreigner who has correct information about the account which I will GIVE to you along with all the LEGAL DOCUMENTS needed by the management of the bank, and with the help of a top official of the bank who is deeply involved in this business. Everything will work out fine. But my only worry is the security and safety of this fund once transferred to you=C2=A0 as we have not known before, and I do not know any foreigner and the bank management will never approve the fund to a local account or indigenous name. We also have a strict banking policy which does not allow citizens of my country to transfer funds out to abroad but a foreigner has unlimited right to transfer funds.
=C2=A0
Regards,
Mr.James Buka
