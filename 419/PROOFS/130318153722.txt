=0ADear Friend,=0A=C2=A0=0AThanks=C2=A0 for responding=C2=A0 to my email and your willingness to partner me in this endeavor. Let me start by introducing myself, I am Michael WU Wei Kuo,=C2=A0 Managing Director & Deputy Chief Executive of Hang Seng Bank LTD. Hong Kong. I have outlined the detailed story of how this=C2=A0 transaction came about and I got your email address discretely from a reputable business/professional directory of your country with assurances about your trustworthy and reliable nature while I was in search of someone to assist me conclude this transaction. Please read carefully. Before the U.S and Iraqi war, our client General Zaiki Taha Abdel who was with the Iraqi Government but a citizen of SAUDI ARABIA, made a numbered fixed deposit for 24 calendar months (2Years), with a value of Sixty Million Dollars (USD) only in my branch. =0A=0AUpon maturity several notices was sent to him, even during the war which began in 2003. Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later find out that General Zaiki Taha Abdel along with his wife and only daughter had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit his Resident. The last time he was at my office he confided in me that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Sixty Million Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 9 years (which means the present govt during the time of deposit will not claim the funds) the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General Zaiki Taha Abdel so that you
 will be able to receive this funds.=0A=C2=A0 =0A=C2=A0=0AConsidering the money involved, and due to the nature of this transaction, I want to be sure that you are ready, to execute this transaction with me, What I expect from you is trust and commitment, I want this large sum of money transferred with your assistance and you should have nothing to worry about regarding legality at all, because what may affects you will also without fail gets back at me too. I will appreciate you to follow my directives amicably as everything will be done in accordance with all international banking laws, and as a banker I know that if we follow up this transaction dilligently and work closely together it would be completed within 7 work days.=C2=A0 I would take care of all the expenses with regards to the lawyer that would provide all legal documentations for this transaction and once again be rest assured that you have nothing whatsoever to worry about.=C2=A0 =0A=C2=A0=0A=C2=A0=0AMind you, we will share the proceeds of this deal in a ratio of 60% for me 40% for you. You are to send your full details, your full name, present address, age, phone and occupation, alongside any form of identification (INTERNATIONAL PASSPORT OR DRIVER'S LICENSE) to enable the attorney prepare the application for funds release and some other documents which you will be required to fill and sign, so he can officially tender the application on our behalf for processing by our bank, before the funds can be endorsed for transfer.
