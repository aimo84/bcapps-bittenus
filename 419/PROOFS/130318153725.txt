Dear Partner=2C
Thank you very much for your response and your interest in this transaction=2C I am also pleased to note that you are a noble and worthy of confidence whom I can rely on and the ability to handle this transaction. As I said before=2C because of this problem on my hands=2C it became necessary for me to seek your help=2C I appreciate the fact that you are willing to help in the implementation of this project and also will help me to invest my money in your country=2C I am sure of that=2C perhaps there are many other transactions that may be set apart for this=2C I have been in the banking sector for many years=2C financially I try every effort to diversify my interest in exploring new frontiers. The funds will be divided in the proportion of 60% for me and 40% for you.
You should have nothing to worry=2C I will do everything legally necessary to ensure the project goes well=2Cyou will not pass through all international banking laws=2C you have my word. The attorney will prepare the necessary affidavits=2C that will be put in place as a family=2C get necessary approvals from the authorities in United Kingdom=2C covering all the aspects involved in this transaction.
This attorney will handle all matters of succession in your name=2C all document's will be perfected=2C and with these documents to be submitted to my bank to request the immediate release and transfer of funds to the account being opened. I've been a banker for many years and know well how the system works. Talking about the risks you should not worry about it=2C my services at this bank for many years to be taken into account=2C I am not a fool=2C the most important factor is that you must maintain strict confidentiality of this transaction it should be between me and you.
I need your total devotion and trust to see this through. I know we have not seen before=2C but I'm pretty sure we will be able to establish the necessary trust that we need to execute this project. Now I am in contact with a bank=2C now intends to open an account in your name in this foreign bank.The money would be transferred to the account to be opened in the bank for both of us=2C this is the best way I found to protect us from my bank. I want to enjoy this money in peace when we conclude. So you should listen to my instructions and follow them religiously. You also have to know that I can not transfer this money in my name as my bank is aware that it is me=2C this is where i need you. As a result=2C you will have to open a bank account in question. I get a certificate of deposit from this my bank=2C which will be issued in your name=2C that makes you the bonafide owner of the funds. After that=2C the money will be put on line for both of us. You can then instruct the bank to transfer our various shares into our respective home bank accounts. Also=2C the perfect will of documentation will be done with the help of my attorney to give the transaction the legal right. Before you begin=2C you need to send me information summarized below=2C I want to be sure I am negotiating with the right person.
