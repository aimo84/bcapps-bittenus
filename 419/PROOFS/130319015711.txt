I
 just check and read your mail. I know you are a stranger but Right now=2C
 I consider you as my devoted friend even without seeing you in person. I
 don't seek anything from you except your sincerity. Once you receive my
 money with you=2C i want you to take the 15% which i have promised you=20
from my heart and distribute the rest as i asked. i dont have any=20
specific places where i can direct you to make donations=2C you have to=20
think about how to start and what to do=2C there are places where people=20
need bread to survive. children die every day from preventable causes=20
like hunger=2C disease=2C and poverty. i
 know this may sounds too good to be true that is why i attached some of the pictures i took after my recent operation.=20
Truly i don't know you and I don't know why my mind choose you but i=20
hope and pray you don't let me down. i have accepted my own faith=2C Happy
 is the man that keeps enduring trial=2C because on becoming approved he=20
will receive the crown of life. I do believe there is a reason for=20
everything that had happened to me in life. You know there is most of=20
the time reasons for everything. A time to weep and a time to laugh=3B A=20
time to mourn and a time to dance. A time to search and a time to give=20
up as lost=3B A time to be silent and a time to speak. A time to love and a
 time to hate. in this world=2C some things that happen can appear to have
 no meaning or purpose. i have had a lot of passion and greatness for=20
helping the needy people. i have dedicated myself towards helping others
 when i was 21 although i have had a lot of bitter experience in life=20
and i dont know why it all happened to me=2C i believe some people's=20
situation are worser than mine which is always a good reason to be=20
humble and give thanks to God daily. i realy have soft corner in my=20
heart for the helpless and poor people. i just cant bear by seeing a=20
person and child in a poor and helpless condition. i have a stronge=20
desire to do something more and bigger for them to help the maximum=20
peoples=2C there are a huge numbers of poor peoples who cant get even one=20
full stomach of meal per day which is the most basic need of a living=20
organism to be alive and i always pray to god that please give food to=20
everyone in this world...i pray to god from the core of my heart that he
 always bless me to be much capable of money so my aim is to provide the
 basic required things to poor people. I am at loss for words as i sit=20
here writing you this message but More importantly=2C I pray for God to=20
bless you over and over again if you fulfil this purpose for me as i=20
want because i really want to focus myself on getting well. nowadays=2C=20
nobody care to help each other=2C we only care for ourselves and people=20
are really suffering in the situation of poverty. Please i need your=20
honesty to distribute this money. I really wish we can talk on phone but
 my condition doesn't allow me talk clearly anymore which is the reason=20
why i am going to undergo another surgery very soon. My health problem=20
is caused by some hydro carbon during crude oil extract. I have already=20
been in this hospital before my family passed away in an explosion=20
anyway i thank God today my condition is getting better. i believe if=20
this is God's will=2C you will follow my instructions and do the charity=20
work with honesty. Please i need you to make the donations from your=20
heart. The law of giving exists and it simply says that if you give you=20
will receive in abundance. But the truth is that you have to give from=20
your heart. I am sure you have heard that phrase before - but here is=20
what it means. When you give from your heart - you give with no=20
expectations. You give only because you want to give - because you want=20
to share what you have and because you want to help somebody. My bank will transfer funds to you but please kindly be honest and tell me more about yourself before i further this with you.
i need to rest now=2C i will check my mail later
God bless youMr Karim Mohamed
