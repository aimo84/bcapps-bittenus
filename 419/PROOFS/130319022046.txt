Dear Intending Partner=2C
=20
Thank you very much for your mail. I am Mr. Mr ching kwok=2C bank officer with the International bank of Taipei=2C Taiwan. Let me give you a detailed description of what is in this transaction for us. In June 2003=2C My late client Muhammad Al-Hakim=2C an Iraqi Crude oil merchant made a numbered fixed deposit of One Billion Five hundred Million Taiwanese New Dollars ($1=2C500=2C000=2C000.00 TWD) for 18 calendar months=2C this is valued to Forty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars($44.5 Million USD) only in my branch. Upon maturity several notices were sent to him=2C even during the war (U.S and Iraqi war)=2C Eight years ago (2004). Again after the war another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We later found out that Muhammad Al-Hakim and his family had been killed during the war in a bomb blast that hit his home at Mukaradeeb where his personal oil well was.
=20
After further investigation it was also discovered that Muhannad Al-Hakim did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank. So=2C the Forty Four million Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of Six years Six months the funds will revert to the ownership of the Taiwan Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.
=20
Against this backdrop=2C we still have about two more months left for someone to come up and claim the funds as next of kin to this fund. My suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Muhannad Al-Hakim so that you will be able to receive his funds and for the money be pulled out from my bank and out from my country.

WHAT IS TO BE DONE?
I want you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary documents that will back you up as the next of kin to  Muhammad Al-Hakim =2C all that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your details as below:
=20
Full Name:
Contact Address:
Occupation:
=20
After you have been made the next of kin=2C the attorney will also file in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favour for the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you.
=20
There is no risk involved at all in this matter as we are going to adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary documents. Please endeavour to observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to your nominated bank account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me=2C 30% for you. Should you be interested please send me your full names and current residential address.
Finally after that I shall provide you with more details of this operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be appreciated.

Kind Regards=2C
