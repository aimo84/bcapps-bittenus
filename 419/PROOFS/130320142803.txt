 Dear Leonard Zeptowitz.

I have just received your mail and I understand your interest towards this project=2C also your question. I want you to know that this is an opportunity for both of us to become rich forever=2C so feel free and accord me your full corporation=2C communicating daily to speed up the transfer of the fund to your bank account.

However=2C the legality=2C confidentiality and the success of this transaction rest on our ability to prove to our Bank head office=2C the genuine of your claim by me sending to you all the relevant documents which will convince the Board Of Directors of our bank and they will transfer the fund to your designated Bank account in your country as quick as possible.

The said fund [US$7=2C 500.000.00] was discovered in my branch in which I am the manager. It came from excess profit from an accrued interest on money deposited by The Economic Community of West African States Contract Payment Committee=2C and the money has been floating. I therefore DEPOSITED this fund in an SUNDRY ACCOUNT (SUNDRY ACCOUNT is a special type of bank account where funds without a legitimate beneficiary are deposited for a specified period of time before the fund is confiscated by the bank management).

            =20
                       HOW THE CLAIM IS TO BE PROCESSED.

What I require is your full co-operation and consent participating vigorously so that our bank will transfer the fund to your bank account which you will nominate soon for the bank.After going through the content of this message=2C get back to me so that I will send to you a draft copy of Application letter/Deposit Slip of claim which you will fill correctly and e-mail/fax it to our Bank to initiate the process for onward payment approval of the fund to your bank account.

You have to accord this transaction the confidentiality it requires and to follow up correspondences promptly until the claim is consummated. If followed up fast=2C the claim could be through within 5 to 6 banking working days.

          =20

                          =20
                             =20
                                                                        SHARING RATIO

As a deal of two people=2C I believe we have agreed on percentage sharing of the proceeds of this claim=2C 45% and 55% for me which you will hold for me until I join you for subsequent sharing and investment plan=2C 5% for any expanses that may arise during the transfer but remember that this 5% will be removed first before the 45%/55% sharing.

This percentage proposition is based on the fact that neither of us can execute the claim without the other and I believe it is a fair proposition. I have taken time to explain in details how this claim will be executed and I hope it will help us forge ahead towards this claim. Please as you reply=2C let me have the following information to enable me draft the Application Letter/Deposit Slip of Claim which you will fill correctly and send direct to the Foreign Remittance Department of the Bank for onward approval for the transfer of this fund into your Bank account.

The information is:

1. Your full name: .
2. Your occupation/position in office: .
3. Your date of birth: .
4. Marital statutes: .
5. Your full contact addresses (Home/office):.
6. First Face of international passport or number: .
7. Your private telephone/fax: .
