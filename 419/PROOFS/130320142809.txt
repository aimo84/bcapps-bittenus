How=0A are you today? I know that you wake up today in good health. Am very =0Ahappy to read your mail today, thank you very much for getting back to =0Ame. I attached my photos to you, and i will be happy to receive your own=0A photo in your next mail to me.I know that by the special grace of =0Aalmighty God we are going to see each other very soon and stay together =0Aas one.=A0

I need some one in my life that will love me and take =0Agood care of me, i don't longer have family of my own, am just an orphan=0A after i lost my parents last 2011 January during the political problem =0Ain my country Ivory Coast Abidjan West Africa, i lost everything, am not=0A longer going to school as i was in my=0A 2nd year before the political problem started and ended on 11th of =0AApril after the formal President Laurent Gbagbo was captured by the UN =0Atroops and French special forces loyal to democratically elected =0Apresident Alassane Dramane Ouattara.

After the formal president =0ALaurent Gbagbo refused to leave office even after formal poll results =0Aand international observers recognized Alassane Dramane Ouattara as the =0Awinner of last presidential elections, he caused alot of death and =0Aproblem in our country, including the death of my late parents and more =0Athan 3,000 people where found dead in our country. There was no =0Aelectricity and water for months, no food, every where was closed and =0Athere was a lot of hunger.=A0

My late parents was killed by the =0Arebels on their way back from the village on January 15 2011, am the =0Aonly Daughter as my senior brother Fulgence died last 7 years ago after a=0A brief illness. After the burial of my late mother on April 28=0A and my late father was buried on 9th of May, i was alone as an orphan =0Aand i was think on how to start alive alone without a family=A0 and how to=0A start to take care of my late father's cocoa farm in our village at =0ABourke. I called my uncles and i told him that i will be coming to the =0Avillage to see them and i will also look and know how my late father's =0Acocoa farm over there is going.=A0

When i get to the village, i =0Anoticed that my uncles has already take control over my late father's =0Acocoa farm and palm oil factory and they told me that i has no write =0Aover anything my late father has as am a woman, because our country =0Astupid customs and tradition says that a woman has no right in anything =0Afamily inheritance. I got so angry with them and came back to the city =0Aand meet our church pastor and explained everything to him and he told =0Ame that i should follow everything with them amicably.=A0

After =0Asome few days one of my uncle Oliver=0A came to our house in the city and told me that he want to stay here =0Awith me as the house is so empty and big for me alone, and i told him =0Athat am not complaining about anything that am ok alone here, but he =0Ainsisted to stay in my late father's house with me. I was not happy and i=0A went to meet our church pastor and told him what is happening, he told =0Ame that i should allow him to stay but i should be careful.

But =0Ain my heart i know them as wicked brothers as my late father use to =0Acomplain everyday about them, because there is nothing my late father =0Awill do to please them.And my late father cried the day my late brother =0Adied, he said that his enemies has gotten him, but i did not understand =0Athe meaning of what he was saying until now that am witnessing =0Aeverything now.=A0

As my uncle Oliver is there in my late father's =0Ahouse with me, i was so afraid about my life as i know that he is there =0Afor something, maybe to kill me so that they will=0A fully take control of everything my late father has before his death. =0AMy uncles has seized all my late father,s properties and sold them away =0Awithout showing any concern or remorse to me. I know that with the money=0A my late father deposited in the bank in another country Senegal, i will=0A use the money to start a new life some where in a foreign country.=A0

So=0A one day i decided to leave my late father's house for them as the rest =0Aof them always visiting there without asking me how am feeding or about =0Amy education, the only money i was using was the little money my late =0Afather put into my account which was not enough for me to go back to =0Aschool, as my uncles seized everything my late father has labored for in=0A life and i know that if i go further to challenge them, they will kill =0Ame.

So last few months ago, everything became unbearable to me =0Aand i noticed that my life is in danger and i also confirmed that none =0Aof them know anything about=0A the money my late father deposited in the bank here in Senegal, so i =0Aleft the house for them and came here to stay with my grandmother and =0Astay here look for a very nice person whom=A0 will be my life partner for =0Aever, who will love me just because of who i am, and i thank God for =0Aproviding me some one like you.

Please i want you to promise me =0Athat you will not disappoint me at the end, promise me that you will =0Alove me for ever, we do our wedding and have our children, we use the =0Amoney for a good investment together in your country which will be under=0A your care as my lovely husband. Please i want to seek for your help =0Awhich i believe that it is for the betterment of both of us and our =0Agreat future.=A0

Please i want you to help to receive my late =0Afather's money he deposited here in Senegal in my name as the next of =0Akin, i will present you to the bank as my foreign trustee /my future =0Ahusband who will help me to receive the money in his=0A account for the investment purposes. Because according to the agreement=0A my late father made with the bank=A0 during the day he deposited the =0Amoney with them, the agreement stated that i will have access to the =0Amoney at the age of 26 years old or the money will be transferred a =0Aforeign partner's account which can be provided to the bank by me or by =0Amy late father in case of death.

The day i went to the bank the =0Abank told me that as soon as i introduce to them the foreign partner =0Awhom the money will transfer to his account, that they will transfer the=0A money to his/her account with out wasting time. Please My dear i really=0A need your help for you to help me so that i will introduce you to the =0Abank as my foreign trustee/my future husband so that the bank will =0Arelease the money to you in your country, so that you will help me to =0Ainvest the money in a good business in your country which will be under =0Ayou care.=A0
