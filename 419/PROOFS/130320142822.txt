Dear

Thank you for your email, I am sorry for the delay in responding to same but it was due to the fact that I had to make sure of the information before sending a response. The message I sent you is regarding a diplomatic funds in your name as contained in our computers, I have personally accessed and followed up on this to make sure before writing to you, It is a huge amount of money and due to the bureaucracy involved, we have decided to deliver the funds using the diplomatic system of delivery. Now you have to realise that this system of delivery is being used by government agencies to move large cash between countries and as am sure that you also know, diplomats are not subject to searches at point of entry into any country of the world especially with documents covering such package.

To enable us carry out the processes of the delivery in your favour, I would advise that you send us your full details as required in our first email to you, I will update you on what processes has to be followed and the delivery will be done.

Regards,
John Blonquist.
