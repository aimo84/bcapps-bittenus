Dear,

Thank your for your swift response, i decided to contact you personally and privately, through email is the only way i can contact you as most telephone networks got destroyed due to crisis.

Even as the international communities are trying to restore peace, Syria is burning and people are dying, nothing is working here anymore, honestly, i don't know if the rest of the world is aware of what is happening in my country, a lot of people died today.

I live with my wife and my two daughters, we are safe for now, though we are making good arrangement to leave the country after moving out our capital fund successfully.

Explaining more about my person, am a Dedicated Muslim who respects people and their kind of religion, after dealing with the AFPC, i became the Regional marketing director of Amrit Petroleum Company here in Syria, i retired 18 months ago to my consultant firm, we deal with Foreign companies in the oil sector.

I know we have never known each other but i believe that we will get along if we communicate further, not minding distance or our religious differences, if you have a good heart to assist me and my family in this time of crisis we will forever remain grateful to you and your family, i write you with a spirit of a man who wish to save his family and family capital.

Due to crisis in my country, there is only one reliable source to move funds out of Syria and that is using the Turkish Airways, it's done with a special arrangement, i want to know if you will consider to assist me receive my capital funds in your account if we move the funds out of Syria using this special arrangement? i will relocate with my family afterwords then with your experience we will go into investment based on agreement, i really hope you will understand my family situation, please our communication must be confidential for security reasons.

Anticipating your soonest reply.

Ahmed
