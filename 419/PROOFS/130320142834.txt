Good day to you, After my letter of investment project funding to you ,your
good potential will be important to  the project funding in your country.

The real situation is that the fund in question is outside the UK and would
like to have a meeting with you in Dubai- UAE  and  hand over the fund for
project investment  to your company to handle for a period of ten years and
for the return of the investment{ROI} gain realized on an annual basis will
be distributed in the ratio of  the investor will own 55% of the fund, your
company as the investment holder will have 45% of the deal. Give us your
business plan if any to us for review or project you intend to execute.

Draft Project Contract documents will be signed in Dubai by both Parties
and the amount the investor will invest to you  in the month of  March /
April  is USD Eight million, Five hundred and sixty thousand
{$8,560,000.00}usd.

Confirm to me as a matter of urgency your ability to handle this project
funding in the nearest time so that the funding procedures in UAE will be
sent to you.  l will now discuss with the Investor regarding the funding.
He wants this funding to remain strictly confidential. Hope l can count on
you on that aspect and also safety of the fund in your custody? That is the
summary of the first mail l sent to you .
