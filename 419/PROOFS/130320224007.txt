Dear Leonard Zeptowitz.

I have just received your mail and I=20
understand your interest towards this project=2C also your question. I=20
want you to know that this is an opportunity for both of us to become=20
rich forever=2C so feel free and accord me your full corporation=2C=20
communicating daily to speed up the transfer of the fund to your bank=20
account.

However=2C the legality=2C confidentiality and the success=20
of this transaction rest on our ability to prove to our Bank head=20
office=2C the genuine of your claim by me sending to you all the relevant=20
documents which will convince the Board Of Directors of our bank and=20
they will transfer the fund to your designated Bank account in your=20
country as quick as possible.

The said fund [US$7=2C 500.000.00]=20
was discovered in my branch in which I am the manager. It came from=20
excess profit from an accrued interest on money deposited by The=20
Economic Community of West African States Contract Payment Committee=2C=20
and the money has been floating. I therefore DEPOSITED this fund in an=20
SUNDRY ACCOUNT (SUNDRY ACCOUNT is a special type of bank account where=20
funds without a legitimate beneficiary are deposited for a specified=20
period of time before the fund is confiscated by the bank management).

            =20
                       HOW THE CLAIM IS TO BE PROCESSED.

What
 I require is your full co-operation and consent participating=20
vigorously so that our bank will transfer the fund to your bank account=20
which you will nominate soon for the bank.After going through the=20
content of this message=2C get back to me so that I will send to you a=20
draft copy of Application letter/Deposit Slip of claim which you will=20
fill correctly and e-mail/fax it to our Bank to initiate the process for
 onward payment approval of the fund to your bank account.

You=20
have to accord this transaction the confidentiality it requires and to=20
follow up correspondences promptly until the claim is consummated. If=20
followed up fast=2C the claim could be through within 5 to 6 banking=20
working days.

          =20
                 =20
                   =20
                          =20
                             =20
                                                                        SHARING RATIO

As
 a deal of two people=2C I believe we have agreed on percentage sharing of
 the proceeds of this claim=2C 45% and 55% for me which you will hold for=20
me until I join you for subsequent sharing and investment plan=2C 5% for=20
any expanses that may arise during the transfer but remember that this=20
5% will be removed first before the 45%/55% sharing.

This=20
percentage proposition is based on the fact that neither of us can=20
execute the claim without the other and I believe it is a fair=20
proposition. I have taken time to explain in details how this claim will
 be executed and I hope it will help us forge ahead towards this claim.=20
Please as you reply=2C let me have the following information to enable me=20
draft the Application Letter/Deposit Slip of Claim which you will fill=20
correctly and send direct to the Foreign Remittance Department of the=20
Bank for onward approval for the transfer of this fund into your Bank=20
account.
