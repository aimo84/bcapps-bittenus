Dear Leonard,=0A=0AThank you very much for responding =C2=A0to my email and your interest this transaction. Let me start by introducing myself. I am =C2=A0MR. Young Chang, Head of Operations in Mevas Bank, Hong Kong. My address is No. 72 Stone Nullah Lane, Wan Chai, Hong Kong. i have lived here for the last 13years.=0A=0AYou have nothing to worry about for i have put all necessary modalities that will ensure the success of this transaction. For legitimacy sake,i have even arranged for the service of a professional attorney who will make sure this transaction is legally carried out putting you as the legal beneficial next of kin to my client General Rafael Eitan. All you just need to do is to follow my instruction so that this transaction can be completed soonest.=0A=0AIn February 2004 one of our customer General Rafael Eitan who was an Israeli and also a big time businessman, made a numbered fixed deposit for 18 calendar months, with a value of Nineteen Million seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars only in my branch and the interest rate for the 18 calendar months was 12% of his deposit, which now put the entire money at my bank presently to Nineteen Million seven Hundred Thousand United State Dollars. This amount was arrived at after the interest was added. Upon maturity several notices was sent to him and no response came from him. We later found out that the General (our customer) died in November 2004. He was found dead in the waters of Ashdod port.=0A=0ACheck the website below for http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4034765.stm=0A=0AAfter further investigation it was discovered that General Rafael Eitan did not declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. So, Nineteen Million seven hundred Thousand United States Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come foward to claim it.=0A=0AWhat bothers me most is that according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 6 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds.=0A=0AAgainst this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to General Rafael Eitan so that you will be able to file for claim to receive the funds. You should not have anything to worry about, I will do everything legally required to ensure that the project goes smoothly, it shall pass through all Laws of International Banking, you have my word. Having resolved to entrust this transaction into your hands, I want to remind you that, it needs your commitment and diligent follow up.

I know we have not met before, but I am very confident that we will be able to establish the necessary trust that we need to execute this project.As part of the modalities/plans on ground to ensure a hitch free transaction, I am already in contact with a foreign corresponding online bank; I intend that you open an account in your name in this foreign bank. The money would be transferred in your name to the account which you will open in the bank for both of us, this is the best way, I have found, it will protect us from my bank. The reason why I want you to set up a new account in this bank for the transfer is because the bank is our corresponding bank and it has the same telex type with my bank; it will make the transfer be seen as in-house transfer and protect us from the attention of any monetary bodies or raise
 any red flag.=0A=0AI want us to enjoy this money in peace when we conclude. So you should listen to my instructions and follow them religiously.

After this, the money will be banked online for both of us. We can then instruct the bank to transfer our various shares into our respective home bank accounts. I will also perfect the documentations with the assistance of my attorney to give the transaction the legal right.=0A=0ABefore I commence,I will need you to send me a copy of any form of your identification ( Driver`s License or international passport through email attachment ) for documentation purpose so that my attorney can commence with the paper-works in your name placing you as the legal beneficiary next of kin to my client General Rafael Eitan.=0A=0AI want to be sure that I am transacting with the correct person to avoid any form of impersonation. As soon as I get these from you, I will commence the paper work. I hope you will understand why I need all these, the money in question is big and I want to ensure that I know you well and avoid future impersonation by some one else before I proceed to give you all the details to commence the project.
