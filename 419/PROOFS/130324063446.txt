Thank you for your response with your request. As you may wish to know,your long over due Inheritance funds hs been lying with the Apex Bank without claim but the present Democratic Government,let by President Goodluck Jonathan has ordered that all foreign beneficiaries should be paid all their funds with immediate effect,this is in consonance with his discussion with the US president.

After a meeting with both the management of the Apex Bank and the Presidency,we agreed on trust that the FIRST BANK NIGERIA PLC should handle the release/transfer of your funds.
