Sequel to your =0Amail i got your email address through internet search after my three =0Adays fasting and prayer for God to give me his divine direction in whom =0Ato choose for this golden opportunity and when i came across your email =0Aaddress i felt something within me and your email address was the first =0Aemail address i came across during my search that is why i congtacted =0Ayou immediately .
=C2=A0

=C2=A0
As =0Asoon as I hear from you, I will send to you a text of application which =0Ayou will fill and send to the bank.

Even the Aids we receive a =0Atimes from Donor countries as well as the international communities are =0Abeing diverted into the private pockets of those in authority .
=C2=A0
Therefore=0A while the rich are getting richer, the poor masses continues to suffer.=0A Could you believe a manager like myself can't even take good care of my=0A children?
