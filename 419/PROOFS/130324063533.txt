Attention: Leonard Zeptowitz, 03/27/2013

The information contained on my previouse email to you is clear. It catigorically states that none resident international transfers requires account owner to pay for the cost of transfer based on the fact that you are not residing here in London where our banks are located. This is applicable world-wide for Multi-currency international bank transfers for Non UK residents. Our Bank have also introduced measures to increase the speed and efficiency of international bank transfers, while keeping a wary eye on security matters and legal concerns, of course.Thanking your for your anticipated Cooperation.

Sincerely yours,

Dr.David Smith
