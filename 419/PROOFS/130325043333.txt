Dear Leonard=2C

I
 received your response and your readiness to partner with me in=20
securing this fund just for the purpose of safe keeping and future=20
investment. However=2C before disclosing the documents and informational=20
details regarding this project like you had requested=2C I would like to=20
give you more explanation on this...

=20
I'm
 general Johnson commanding the 3rd battalion and 8th Marines regiment=20
deployed by the United Nations to Afghanistan in order to reinforce=20
peace keeping in the country. During my 10yrs stay in Afghanistan=2C i=20
made about the sum of Three million United States Dollars from crude oil
 while on peace keeping here (Afghanistan). I used my diplomatic=20
contacts to get this funds transferred and deposited in a Security=20
financial company in Malaysia=2C because as a uniform man=2C there are laws=20
restricting us to be in possession of such huge funds that is why i=20
decided to find someone that is real and not imaginary who can be=20
sincere and partner with me in distributing these funds for safe=20
keeping.

=20
This
 is my proposal: I want you to give your consent that I present you to=20
the security company where these funds are domiciled as the bonafide=20
beneficiary of these funds so we could put up a claim to this fund=2C and=20
when I confirm and authorize payment of the fund to you=2C and the money=20
is transferred to you=2C then you will take 40% of the whole amount and=20
remit 60% to me.

=20
If
 you are interested=2C then we shall proceed to execute this transaction. I
 will provide all the relevant documents of the of the funds. As soon as
 the bank receives your claim=2C they will notify me that someone is=20
laying claims to the funds=2C and I will then proceed to confirm and=20
authenticate your status as the bonafide beneficiary and also the true=20
beneficiary of the fund=2C and also make recommendations in your favor.

=20
Once
 the Security company completes their verifications they will open up=20
correspondence with you and initiate the process of the transfer.

=20
All
 I have explained above are the exact steps and procedures which this=20
transaction involves=2C and will take a maximum of few weeks to complete=20
both the legal documentation process as well as the Transfer process.

However=2C
 I will only commence this process with you on the proviso that you=20
pledge total honesty=2C respect the confidentiality of this transaction=20
and keep it as such.

=20
I will also expect you to complete the data form and send back to me so I can initiate this process.

Before
 I commence=2C I will need you to send me a copy of any form of your=20
identifications (Driver's license or International passport). I want to=20
be sure that I am transacting with the correct person. I hope you=20
understand exactly why I need this information.

=20
Information Required:

=20
(i) Name of Beneficiary (Your full names)

(ii) Beneficiary's Address. (Your address)

(iii) Contact Telephone and Fax numbers

(IV) a copy of your passport/drivers license.

(v)Age=2C Occupation and Marital Status.

=20
The
 money in question is huge and I want to ensure that I know you well=20
before I proceed to give you all the details to commence the project.

I
 will see to it that this transfer is executed within the next few weeks
 if you give your diligence and commitment to this transaction. You must
 also follow my instructions religiously=2C to keep every bit of it and=20
act accordingly.

I would implore you observe utmost confidentiality in this project.

If
 you are interested in my proposal and you are ready to proceed=20
confidentially=2C then reach me without further delay so that we can get=20
started.

=20
Thanks for your patience=2C reading through this long email.

Best Regards=2C

Gen. Bright Johnson
