THE AMOUNT IS 39 MILLION USD.Attached are the first two pages of my
International Passport for you to know whom you are dealing with. Please
mail  yours to me and state below it the % you want to give to me that is
the only thing I have to show I did business with you. .I SUGGEST 50% FOR
YOU, SAME FOR ME.

I will transfer this fund through Citibank .

 Already I have started making arrangement to travel with my family through
the Republic of Benin to YOUR COUNTRY. via London. I will be arriving with
my wife and 2 daughters. *Mail to me fast your residential and private
telephone/fax numbers and address. Please note that you should email
immediately your Bank Details, Bank Name, Bank Address, Account Name &
Account Number for reconfirmation sake so that I do not make mistakes when
transferring the fund.*

Mail to me the email address and the name of the nearest motel to your
house including their email address not the web site pls.  I will transfer
the fund without the due banking procedure. I will destroy all documents
and scramble the passwords of the main frame of the computer of the telex
department so that they will not know where the fund is, making it
impossible to trace the fund to any account. Though they will know I did it
but before then I am out of the country. Once the fund leaves shores of
this country nobody on earth I repeat nobody can trace the fund to any
account anywhere in the world. So there is no reason for any anxiety. Try
and be in constant touch with me. My wife is anxious to speak to you as to
our accomodation. When you receive this call me.

If I discover you are in communication with any Nigerian I will back out
for my own security . Our password henceforth will be MONEY. When you call
me ask me for the code and I will answer MONEY. *ALL REPLIES MUST GO VIA
