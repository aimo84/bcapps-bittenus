Peace Of The Lord Brethren=2C

May the peace of the lord be with you and your house hold=2CMrs Mary Johnson have willed funds to you as her beneficiary=2CI happen to know Mrs. Mary Johnson very well=2C over the years=2Cwith her commitment with the church and this brought me close to her=2C she is in intensive care now and she claims to be closer to her God "day by day" borrowing from her terms=2CBut i still believe the God we serve is not asleep=2C it is a pity you have not come to know her as she is definitely a people oriented person.

She was a lead singer=2Cand presently she was a deaconess before she felt ill. I would suggest you follow this through to at least satisfy your conscience=2C if she donated funds to you=2C then I would expect you should question why? Especially if you do not really know this woman of faith.

You see she had no issues (child) and so she gave her funds to her brother and sister she actually gave a rather large amount as a gift to her relatives and requested they use some funds for charity=2C they thought she would die soon so they confiscated everything for their selfish use=2C this led her to will her remaining funds to someone else=2C I had often asked her about this someone else all she told me was God will show her. I guess you are that someone and the lucky one.

Note that the details you received from her (LLP/953/900//316US/UK) was a probing move to establish contact=2C because I am sure you know as well as I do that most people would snatch at the offer considering the large amount involved and also since the disbursement of this fund would be entirely in the hands of the claimant.=20

For this reason she felt that after our initial communication I should be able to determine if we can proceed based on certain indices as well as intuitive feeling I would deduce has her pastor.

I shall undertake to collate relevant details with regards to the funds withdrawal process.( this will include the original deposit certificate issued by the finance house when her funds were deposited=2C{you will need to present this at the financial institute where the funds are presently lodged=2C and I will find it no imposition to assist you when that time comes.} Power of attorney and her will with the relevant changes in place) The relevant documents which include the power of attorney must be completed with pertinent information from you=2C these will include the following:

Full names
Address
Country of origin
Sex
Date of birth
Direct telephone & fax numbers
Occupation

Once you send the above details I shall draft the power of attorney and send you a copy for your use alongside the finance/security firm's contact details=2C so you can make the funds withdrawal.
=20
Please note that all paper works to gain you access to her funds which you are specifically to put to charitable use will be given you by her barrister whom i will be contacting on your behalf to do the paper work in your name=2C It is very important you keep this confidential as Mrs. Mary Johnson has requested your utmost confidentiality in this matter due to reactions which could arise from her relatives who has plundered her wealth to their selfish interest.

Please respond promptly to enable me carry out my obligations to you and Mrs. Mary Johnson.
Best Regards

Pastor Adams Parker
Westboro Baptist Church
