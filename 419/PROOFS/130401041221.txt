Hello,

Once again thank you for your response.

I am with the 82nd Airborne Division part of the 50,000 troops that
just left Iraq, I am currently on the move to complete the later part
of the war plan, however my unit was deployed to Afghanistan on a
temporary mission from where i should be heading home after a
dedicated and selfless service to my country. Be rest assured that
this is an opportunity that came for both of us to be comfortable in
life. Please all I need from you is to make sure that you adhere to my
instructions. The funds in question was discovered by my unit during
one of our numerous raids on Saddam Hussein palaces all over Iraq, the
notes are neatly packed in two military spec consignment boxes and
right now i am seeking your help and partnership to move them to the
U.S

This is my private email address so that no one will be able to trace
anything. Please note that the usage of private phones here is out of
bound to us out here because all international calls are monitored.
But I will always work out ways to call you via public phones when
necessary. Like I told you earlier I'm still on duty here in
Afghanistan after we moved from Iraq and if such amount of money is
traced to my account in the united states, I shall be investigated
hence I need you to assist me get the funds out. It is $45million in
total, we would share it 60/40 percent, and you would help me invest
in hotels and real estate.

If and only if you are interested, I need the following: Your
name,Your phone number and address where the boxes will be shipped
using a special delivery and military immunity.More info once I get
your details and you agree to help just to be on the safe side.

God bless America!!

Cpt. Sam Gallardo
