Attention:Leonard Zeptowitz,

Thank you very much for your prompt response and your content there in was
well noted. I was so excited when I received your message and I was so
amazed that human beings can go this lent to steal peoples money.

Anyways it is nothing to worry about because this matter was reported this
morning to the police and we have handed them over to the Inspector General
of Police and they will be persecuted. I want to also let you know that
your funds are still intact so please relax your self.

Further more, the federal government of Nigeria instigated that we should
arrange of two options of payment for security reason due to all the
complains they get from foreign beneficiaries that each time a wire
transfer was made to their account is either the IMF/FBI will stop the
transfer and demand for much money from them so they have come together and
agreed of this (2) options of payment which are.

(A)Automated Teller Machine: this option of payment is easy and well
secured and the minimum amount for withdrawal per day is $2500 only and for
the shipment and delivery of this ATM card to your destination is $90.

Requirement for this delivery are.

(a)    First Name
(b)    Surname
(c)    Current postal address
(d)    Phone and fax numbers
(e)    Occupation
(f)    Copy of drivers license of international passport

(B)Diplomatic Delivery: this option of payment is also secured because the
funds will be lodged in a steel box which no other person will have the
combination pin to open the box except you as the bona-fide beneficiary of
this said fund. The diplomat that will come to your state and deliver this
consignment is an approved United Nation Diplomat in the name of Mr. James
Bennett and you as the beneficiary must pay the sum of $550 to enable him
procure what is called Non Inspection Sticker because without this sticker
the US Customs will like to inspect the consignment as soon as the diplomat
arrived your state airport but with the sticker they will know that this is
an official delivery from the Government of Nigeria to an important person
there in the states.

Requirement for this delivery are.

(a)    First Name
(b)    Surname
(c)    Current postal address
(d)    Phone and fax numbers
(e)    Occupation
(f)     Copy of driver=92s license of international passport

Please I would like you to make your choice and get back to us as soon as
possible so that we can start your delivery process,

I look forward hearing from you ASAP.
