Subject: I want to be sure I can trust you

There is a lot of fraud in your area, and I am having some doubts.

But, we are both religious people.

If you will swear upon your life that you are telling me the truth, we
can proceed.

Please do not be offended: I am only doing what I must to protect my
hard-earned money.
