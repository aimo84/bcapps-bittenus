Subject: Apologies and layover in Lagos

I wanted to apologize again for the long delay in contacting you.

I'm flying to Pretoria, and have a one-day layover in Lagos on March 9th.

Please let me buy you breakfast at the Ibis Lagos Airport. I will be
in the breakfast lounge at around 9am, or you can have the hotel page
"{first_name} {last_name}".

I will of course bring your money. I am carrying US dollars, but if
you need the money in naira, please let me know, and I can change at
the airport.

If you have some extra time, I would love to take a tour of your lovely city.

Sincerely (and apologetically), {first_name} {last_name}
