Subject: Western Union customer

I'm a clerk at the local Western Union.

A customer just came in, asking me to send you a considerable amount
of money.

I told the customer I'd sent it, but I've actually kept it on hold.

The customer showed me your letter. I immediately recognized it as a
419 advance free fraud scam, but didn't say anything.

I'd like to make you a deal. I'll send you half the money, if you let
me keep half for myself.

You can then direct other victims here, and we can share more profits.

If you don't agree or don't answer, I'll tell the customer and the
local police that you're a scammer, and you'll get nothing.

Please reply to my private email address {email_address} or call me on
my cell at {phone_number}.

Please do not call me at work, as I will deny all knowledge of this email.
