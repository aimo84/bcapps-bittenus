NOTES
=====

bc-dump-cheb.pl: creates files like
"ascp02000.431.bz2.sun,mercury,venus,earthmoon,mars,jupiter,saturn,uranus.mx"
which lets Mathematica determine planet positions at any time during
the given millenia (not just at discrete intervals)

bc-pos-dump.m: given output of above, create a Mathematica file with
daily positions for all planets (my belief is that it's faster to
cache these, though that might be 100% wrong)
