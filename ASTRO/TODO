TODO
====

  - Add Vesta to conjunctions db?

  - Orbit of Mercury/other planets as viewed from Sun is very "steady"
  (compared to barycenter orbit?), perhaps leaflet plot this just for fun

  - Create page that just pops up random conjunctions to torture search engines

  - Add ecliptic coordinates to the HYG db (I've pinged owner of database to ask if he's interested)

  - Instead of using size to indicate different stellar brightnesses,
  consider using colors (ie, black to white), though early experiments
  didn't go well

  - List Mercury/Venus transits (despite what README file says, I don't have these listed)

  - the ellipseEA2B requires a first, hideous naming
