I wrote
https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/6d6801b590a9d3ab3dc4bc1906e37ab522df07f1/ASTRO/bc-zodiac.c
to solve this. I've tweaked bc-zodiac.c slightly since then, so you'll
need the exact link above (not the most recent version of bc-zodiac.c)
to confirm/replicate my results. In the directory
https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/ASTRO/

  - The file "houses.txt.bz2" contains a list of all house changes for
  now +- ~15000 years in a mostly-English-readable format.

  - The file "house-states.txt.bz2" is a list of all "horoscopes"
  (house states for all planets) in machine readable format for the
  same period. Please see
  https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/ASTRO/bc-zodiac.txt
  (which also contains the text of this answer) for details on how to
  read this file.

Important caveats below, but first, some notes:

  - In the 11,100,016 days (about 30,391 years) covered, there are
  6,359,881 horoscope changes, for an average horoscope change roughly
  every 1.75 days. Broken down by planet:

    - The moon changes house 4,875,275 times, about once every 2.3 days.

    - Mercury changes house 450,531 times (including retrograde house
    changes), about once every 25 days.

    - Venus changes house 384,969 times (including retrograde), about
    once every 29 days.

    - The Sun comes in third with 364,691 changes, about once every 30
    days. A more exact number is once every 30.4367697585 days. When
    you multiply this by 12, you get 365.2412371020 days, which, as
    expected, is a good estimate of the length of the tropical year
    (the exact value given by
    http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html is
    365.242190402, which is 82 seconds different).

    - Mars changes house (including retrograde) 209,501 times, about
    once every 53 days.

    - Jupiter (w/ retrograde) 49,217 times, once every ~225.5 days.

    - Saturn (w/ retrograde) 25,697 times, ~432 days.

  - Since there are 12 houses and 7 planets, there are 12^7 = 35,831,808
  "possible" horoscopes, although even the theoretical number is lower
  than this since Mercury and Venus must remain within a certain
  distance of the Sun.

  - Of these possibilities there are 2,565,619 actual horoscopes. Of these,

    - 969,161 horoscopes occur only once

    - The horoscope "4045424" (translated below) occurs 18 times (most
    recently in 1799 and next in 5391), but two others occur 17 times,
    10 appear 16 times, and many appear 15 times. The most frequently
    occurring horoscope is: Sun in Leo, Moon in Aries, Mercury in Leo,
    Venus in Virgo, Mars in Leo, Jupiter in Gemini, Saturn in Leo.

Note that this horoscope is probably only the most frequent because of
how I chose the start and end dates (based on the DE431 ephemeris).

Important caveats:

  - I used a "stepsize" of 86400 seconds (1 day), so if a planet
  changed house and then changed back in under a day, my program may
  miss it. Someone w/ more computing power may wish to re-run my
  program with a smaller stepsize.

  - The moon's position varies with your location on Earth. I used a
  geocentric model, giving the moon's position for a theoretical
  observer located at the center of the Earth.

  - The human-readable time in houses.txt.bz2 is the output of the C
  function
  http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/timout_c.html
  They are reasonable for current dates, but not necessarily for past
  dates because the Gregorian Reformation of the calendar occurred at
  different times for different countries, and the BCE/CE time system
  didn't exist prior to 1 CE (and probably not even then). For
  precision work, see bc-zodiac.txt for details.

  - As requested, I use "ARIES" to mean the "1st house", ie, the
  constellation that starts at the vernal equinox ("the first point of
  Aries", where the ascending ecliptic meets the celestial equator)
  and ends 30 ecliptic degrees of ecliptic longitude later.

    - This was reasonably accurate in 56 BCE (-55 in stellarium means 56 BCE):

[[239]]

    - But is certainly not true today:

[[237]]

as the vernal equinox is in Pisces and drifts towards Aquarius,
heralding the "Age of Aquarius".

    - In the 30,000+ year period covered by my program, the first
    point of Aries makes a complete circuit (and a bit more) of the
    Zodiac, even ending up in Ophiuchus for a while:

[[238]]

Of course, the constellation boundaries above are those defined by the
IAU. I don't know how (or if) the ancients drew their constellation
boundaries.

NOTE: I wanted to use H.A. Rey's constellation lines, but Stellarium's
constellation boundaries appear to break for Pisces when I do that.

shortest time between state changes? longest? [but disclaim shortest]




notes for writeup:

tolerance 1s and will miss twice in a day 

disclaim geocentricity for moon

add uranus/netpune/pluto/asteroids maybe

you can and should check and answers, link to proggie of course

disclaim accuracy and completenes and note 1 day rule and that you
will need kernels

disclaim results dont agree to the minute with https://cafeastrology.com/astrologyof2017horoscopes.html

leaving old answer for do it yourselfers

HOW TO READ houses.txt.bz2
==========================

This file contains a list of all house changes for the 7 major planets
(subject to caveats above) in both English and machine readable
format. The fields are:

  - Note: If you are programmatically  parsing this file, note that:

    - Some lines contain leading spaces, which must be removed before
    counting fields.

    - You should probably be using house-states.txt.bz2 instead


  - Fields 1 and 2 are the prettified version of the time at which the
  house change occurs

  - Field 3 is the planet whose house is changing

  - Field 4 is always the word "ENTERS"

  - Field 5 is the planet's new house

  - Field 6 is whether the planet is entering the house prograde (the
  more frequent behavior) or retrograde.

  - Field 7 is approximately the number of second before or after the
  Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC). More specifically, it's
  et+946728000-delta, where et is the ephemeris time and delta is the
  difference between ephemeris time and UTC. For more details see
  bclib.h in https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/ASTRO
  and http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/time.html

  - Field 8 is the short form of which planet has entered which
  house. The first character is the planet and the second character is
  the house. For the planets (first character):

    - "S" means Sun
    - "M" means Moon
    - "1" means Mercury
    - "2" means Venus
    - "4" means Mars
    - "5" means Jupiter
    - "6" means Saturn

For the house (second character):

    - "0" means Aries
    - "1" means Taurus
    - "2" means Gemini
    - "3" means Cancer
    - "4" means Leo
    - "5" means Virgo
    - "6" means Libra
    - "7" means Scorpio
    - "8" means Sagittarius 
    - "9" means Capricorn
    - "A" means Aquarius ("A" is the hex form of the number 10)
    - "B" means Pisces ("B" is the hex form of the n****)
