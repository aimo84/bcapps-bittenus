This trivial landscape simulates refraction at the horizon in
stellarium by drawing the horizon 34 arcminutes below the geometric
horizon.

Later versions of stellarium include refraction and/or support a
refraction plugin, so this is only useful if you have an older version
of stellarium

To use, create a ~/.stellarium/landscapes/refraction directory
and then choose "refraction" as your landscape
