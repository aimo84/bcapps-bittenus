Imagine you are at 35N,106W at 5h local sidereal time.

The celestial north pole is at (0,90) in the celestial frame and
(0,35) in your frame.

The point (5h,0) is (75,0) in the celestial sphere (1h = 15 degrees),
and (180,55) in your frame [note: you can also treat 5h as -75
degrees, which may make the math slightly simpler]
