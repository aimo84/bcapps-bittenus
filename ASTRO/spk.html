<h3> DAF Run-Time Binary File Format Translation
</h3><p><br><br>
   Starting with the N0052 release of the SPICE Toolkit (January, 2002)
   certain supported platforms are able to read DAF-based binary files
   (SPK, CK and binary PCK) that were written using a different, or
   non-native, binary representation. This access is read-only; any
   operations requiring writing to the file (adding information to the
   comment area, or appending additional ephemeris data, for example)
   require prior conversion of the file to the native binary file format.
   See the Convert User's Guide, <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/ug/convert.html">convert.ug</a>, for details.

<h3> Detection of Non-native Text Files
</h3><p><br><br>
   Starting with the N0057 release of the SPICE Toolkit (March, 2004) the
   SPICE data loading mechanism detects and prohibits loading text kernel
   files containing lines terminated with EOF character(s) non-native to
   the platform on which the Toolkit was compiled. If a non-native EOL
   terminator is detected in the first 132 characters of a text kernel, the
   execution is stopped and an error message is displayed. This feature
   does not work with files that are smaller that 132 bytes or have the
   first line longer that 132 characters.

   We'll discuss things in more detail in a moment but in case you are just
   looking for the right name of the function to perform some ephemeris
   task, here is a categorization of the most frequently used SPK and
   related functions in CSPICE. Input arguments are given in lower case and
   enclosed in ``angle brackets.'' Output arguments are given in plain

<h2> Introduction
</h2><hr align="LEFT" width="50%"><p><br><br>
   To help fully understand the science data returned from a spacecraft's
   instruments it is necessary to know, at any given epoch, the positions
   and possibly the velocities of the spacecraft and all the target bodies
   of interest. The purpose of the SPK---which stands for S(pacecraft) and
   P(lanet) Kernel---file is to allow ephemerides for any collection of
   solar system bodies to be combined under a common file format, and
   accessed by a common set of functions.
</p><p>
 
   Historically, ephemerides for spacecraft have been organized differently
   from those for planets and satellites. They are usually generated
   through different processes and using different representations.
   However, there is no essential reason for keeping them separate. A
   spacecraft, planet, satellite, comet, or asteroid has a position and
   velocity relative to some center of mass and reference frame.
   Consequently all of these objects can be represented in an SPK file.
</p><p>
 
   Consider the Galileo mission. Some of the objects of special interest to
   the Galileo mission are:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   Galileo Spacecraft
   Galileo Probe
   Earth
   Moon
   Earth Moon Barycenter
   Venus
   Sun
   Solar System Barycenter (S.S.B.)
   Asteroid Ida
   Ida's Satellite Dactyl
   Asteroid Gaspra
   Comet Shoemaker-Levy
   Jupiter System Barycenter (J.B.)
   Jupiter
   Io
   Ganymede
   Europa
   Callysto
   Goldstone Tracking Station.
</pre>
   Each of these objects has a position and velocity (state) relative to
   some other object. The graph below illustrates which objects will be
   used as reference objects for representing the states of others.
<p>
 
</p><pre>                          +Gll

                       o
                    Goldstone
</pre>
   This graph is somewhat complicated. Nevertheless, the complete ephemeris
   history for all of these objects can be captured in a single SPK file.
<p>
 
   (Although we can store the entire ephemeris history illustrated above in
   a single SPK file, for the sake of data management a project is likely
   to use several SPK files. However, even in this case, all of the SPK
   files can be used simultaneously.)
</p><p>
 
   The SPK format is supported by a collection of functions that are part
   of the CSPICE library---the major component of the SPICE Toolkit. This
   family of SPK functions provides the following capabilities:
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> Insert ephemeris data from some source into an SPK file.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> Make the ephemeris data in one or more SPK files available to a user's
program.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>3.</tt> Return the apparent, true, or geometric state (position and velocity) of
one ephemeris object as seen from another in some convenient reference
frame.
<br><br></ul>
   The SPK software allows you to ignore the potential ephemeris complexity
   associated with the a mission such as Galileo and allows you to more
   directly compute various quantities that depend upon the position or
   velocity of one object as seen from another.
<p>

<a name="SPK Files"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h2> SPK Files
</h2><hr align="LEFT" width="50%"><p><br><br>
   SPICE software writes SPK files in a binary (non-ASCII) format
   structured in a NAIF developed abstract file architecture called Double
   Precision Array File (DAF). The DAF architecture and supporting software
   is discussed in the DAF Required Reading document, <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/daf.html">daf.req</a>. The SPICE
   file identification word occupying the first eight bytes of a properly
   created binary SPK file is ``DAF/SPK ''. For more information on SPICE
   identification words refer to the Kernel Required Reading document,
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/kernel.html">kernel.req</a>. If you need only use SPK files as a data source or if you
   will use a SPICE utility program for creating SPK files, you can safely
   ignore aspects of the DAF system not covered by this document. On the
   other hand, if you plan to write software for creating SPK files you
   will probably need to familiarize yourself with the DAF software
   contained in CSPICE. The particular aspects of the DAF architecture that
   are relevant to the SPK format are discussed later in this document (see
   below---SPK Format).
</p><p>
 
   Since SPKs are written as binary files, the specific binary format
   depends on the computer architecture on which the SPK was created, in
   the case of SPICE either big-endian or little-endian (NAIF no longer
   supports DEC platforms).
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Use of SPK files between computers"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Use of SPK files between computers
</h3><p><br><br>
   NAIF extended the DAF capability in SPICE Toolkit delivery N0052 to
   allow reading of both big-endian and little-endian binary DAF files by
   all toolkits. This process is a run-time interpretation of non-native
   binary files. Run-time interpretation does not yet work for any file
   built upon the SPICE "DAS" architecture.
</p><p>
 
   NAIF provides two utility programs---TOXFR and SPACIT for converting
   SPICE binary kernels to a ``transfer format'' suitable for text copying
   from one computer to another. Once the transfer format file has been
   copied, the SPICE utilities TOBIN and SPACIT are available for
   converting the transfer format file to the binary format suitable for
   the new machine.
</p><p>
 
   The utilities TOXFR and TOBIN are ``command line'' programs. To convert
   a binary kernel to transfer format you simply type TOXFR followed by the
   name of the binary kernel at your terminal prompt.
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   prompt&gt; toxfr spk_file
</pre>
   To convert a transfer format to binary format, you type TOBIN followed
   by the name of the transfer format kernel.
<p>
 
</p><pre>   prompt&gt; tobin transfer_file
</pre>
   The utility SPACIT is an interactive program that allows you to select a
   function from a menu to perform on a file. This program can also be used
   to convert to or from transfer format files.
<p>
 
   Note that transfer format files cannot be ``loaded'' into a SPICE based
   program to retrieve ephemeris data. Only binary format files can be used
   for retrieving ephemeris data with SPICE software.
</p><p>
 
   CSPICE (and by extension Icy and Mice) uses the same binary kernels as
   does SPICELIB.

<a name="Examining SPK files"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Examining SPK files
</h3><p><br><br>
   Since SPK files are binary files, you can't just open them with your
   favorite text editor to determine which ephemeris objects are
   represented in the file. Instead you need to use one of the SPICE
   utility programs that allow you to summarize the ephemeris contents of
   an SPK file. The first of these is SPACIT which was introduced above.
   The second is the command line utility BRIEF.
</p><p>
 
   BRIEF gives a quick summary of the contents of the file and supports a
   wide set of summary options. SPACIT on the other hand, provides
   summaries that are more detailed and reflect closely the actual internal
   structure of the file. Unless you need the more detailed summary, you'll
   probably find BRIEF to be a better tool for examining the contents of an
   SPK file.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Meta Data in the SPK file"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Meta Data in the SPK file
</h3><p><br><br>
   SPICE kernels may contain ``meta'' data that describe the contents,
   intended use, accuracy, etc. of the kernel. This meta data is called the
   ``comments'' portion of the kernel. Many SPK files contain comments that
   can help you decide upon the suitability of the kernel for your
   application. Two SPICE utilities are available for examining the
   comments of a binary kernel---COMMNT and SPACIT.
</p><p>
 
   We've already introduced SPACIT. COMMNT is similar to SPACIT in that it
   too is an interactive program. However, COMMNT also allows you to modify
   the comments of an SPK file. Using COMMNT you can delete the comments of
   an SPK file, extract the comments to a text file, or append the text
   from some text file to the comments already present in the kernel.
</p><p>
 
   If you create SPK files, we strongly recommend that you add comments to
   the kernel that describe who created it, expected usage of the kernel,
   and the expected accuracy of the position/velocity information contained
   in the kernel. A comment template is provided in the appendix
   ``COMMENTS''.
</p><p>
 
   Warning: If you add comments to an SPK (or other binary kernel) using
   COMMNT, you must wait for the program to complete the task before
   exiting the program. Failure to wait for COMMNT to finish its work will
   result in irreparable corruption of the binary kernel. (See the COMMNT
   User's Guide, <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/ug/commnt.html">commnt.ug</a>, [212] for details on the use of COMMNT).

<a name="Terminology"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Terminology
</h3><p><br><br>
   Throughout this document we shall be using terms such as reference
   frame, state, ephemeris time, etc. We include a brief review of these
   terms below.
</p><p>
 
</p><dl><dt>
<b>
 Reference Frame
</b><br><br>
</dt><dd>
 A reference frame is a Cartesian coordinate system with three axes---x,
y and z. The axes are mutually orthogonal. The center of the frame is
the origin of the Cartesian reference system. For the reference frames
in SPICE, the positions of the axes are typically defined by some
observable object. For example, in the J2000 reference frame, the
x-axis is defined to lie in the intersection of two planes: the plane
of the Earth's equator and the plane of the Earth's orbit. The z-axis
is perpendicular to the Earth's equator. The y-axis completes a
right-handed system. The center of the frame is typically taken to be
the solar system barycenter. (Note we are not attempting to rigorously
define the J2000 frame here. We are only illustrating how reference
frames are defined. Many more details are required for a rigorous
definition of the J2000 frame. These details are given in the SPICE
document ``Frames'' [349].)<br>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>
<b>
 State
</b><br><br>
</dt><dd>
 A state is an array of six double precision numbers. The first three
numbers give the x, y, and z coordinates respectively for the position
of some object relative to another object in some Cartesian reference
frame. The next three numbers give the velocity ( dx/dt, dy/dt and
dz/dt respectively) of the object with respect to the same reference
frame.<br>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>
<b>
 Inertial Frame
</b><br><br>
</dt><dd>
 An inertial frame, is one in which Newton's laws of motion apply. A
frame whose axes are not moving with respect to the observed positions
of distant galaxies and quasars approximates an inertial frame.<br>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>
<b>
 Non-Inertial Frame
</b><br><br>
</dt><dd>
 A non-inertial frame is a frame that rotates with respect to the
celestial background. For example a frame whose axes are fixed with
respect to the features on the surface of the Earth is a non-inertial
frame.<br>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>
<b>
 Ephemeris Time (ET)
</b><br><br>
</dt><dd>
 Ephemeris time, ET, is the independent variable in the equations of
motion that describe the positions and velocities of objects in the
solar system. In CSPICE we treat ET as a synonym for Barycentric
Dynamical Time. As far as has been experimentally determined, an atomic
clock placed at the solar system barycenter, would provide a faithful
measure of ET.<br>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>
<b>
 Seconds Past 2000
</b><br><br>
</dt><dd>
 In the SPK system times are specified as a count of seconds past a
particular epoch---the epoch of the J2000 reference frame. This
reference epoch is within a second or two of the UTC epoch:
12:01:02.184 Jan 1, 2000 UTC. (See the document <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/time.html">time.req</a> for a more
thorough discussion of the J2000 epoch). Epochs prior to this epoch are
represented as negative numbers. The ``units'' of ET are designated in
several different ways: seconds past 2000, seconds past J2000, seconds
past the Julian year 2000, seconds past the epoch of the J2000 frame.
All of these phrases mean the same thing and are used interchangeably
throughout this document.<br>
</dd></dl>
<dl><dt>
<b>
 SPK segment
</b><br><br>
</dt><dd>
 The trajectories of objects in SPK files are represented in pieces
called segments. A segment represents some arc of the full trajectory
of an object. Each segment contains information that specifies the
trajectory of a particular object relative to a particular center of
motion in a fixed reference frame over some particular interval of
time. From the point of view of the SPK system segments are the atomic
portions of a trajectory.<br>
</dd></dl>
<br><br>
<a name="The SPK Family of Functions"></a>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h2> The SPK Family of Functions
</h2><hr align="LEFT" width="50%"><p><br><br>
   CSPICE contains a family of functions that are designed specifically for
   use with SPK files. The name of each function begins with the letters
   `spk', followed by a two- or three-character mnemonic. For example, the
   function that returns the state of one body with respect to another is
   named <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>, pronounced `S-P-K-easier'. A complete list of mnemonics,
   translations, and calling sequences can be found at the end of this
   document.
</p><p>
 
   Each function is prefaced by a complete CSPICE header, which describes
   inputs, outputs, restrictions, and exceptions, discusses the context in
   which the function can be used, and shows typical examples of its use.
   Any discussion of the functions in this document is intended as an
   introduction: the final documentation for any function is its header.
</p><p>
 
   Whenever an SPK function appears in an example, the translation of the
   mnemonic part of its name will appear to the right of the reference, in
   braces. We also continue with the convention of distinguishing between
   input and output arguments by enclosing input arguments in angle
   brackets. For example,
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> ( &lt;targ&gt;,  &lt;et&gt;,  &lt;frame&gt;,
              &lt;aberr&gt;, &lt;obs&gt;,
              state,   &amp;lt            );  { Easier state }
</pre>
   All C functions, including those whose names do not begin with `SPK',
   are from CSPICE or the standard ANSI C library.
<p>
 
   SPK readers are available to perform the following functions.
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> Determine the apparent, true, or geometric state of a body with respect to
another body relative to a user specified reference frame.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> Determine the apparent, true, or geometric state of a body with respect to
an observer with having a user-supplied state.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>3.</tt> Determine the geometric state of a body with respect to the solar system
barycenter.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>4.</tt> Determine the geometric state of a target body with respect to its center
of motion for a particular segment.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>5.</tt> Determine, from a list of SPK files supplied by the calling program, the
files and segments needed to fulfill a request for the state of a
particular body.
<br><br></ul>
<br><br>
<a name="Computing States"></a>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Computing States
</h3><p><br><br>
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> is the most powerful of the SPK readers. It determines the
   apparent, true, or geometric state of one body (the target) as seen by a
   second body (the observer) relative to a user specified reference frame.
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> ( &lt;targ&gt;,  &lt;et&gt;,  &lt;frame&gt;,
              &lt;aberr&gt;, &lt;obs&gt;,
              state,   &amp;lt            );  { Easier state }
</pre>
   The function accepts five inputs---target body, epoch, reference frame,
   aberration correction type, and observing body---and returns two
   outputs---state of the target body as seen from the observing body, and
   one-way light-time from the target body to the observing body.
<p>
 
   The target body, observing body and frame are identified by strings that
   contain the names of these items. For example, to determine the state of
   Triton as seen from the Voyager-2 spacecraft relative to the J2000
   reference frame
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> ( "triton",    et,    "j2000", aberr,
              "voyager-2", state,  &amp;lt           ); { Easier state }
</pre>
   By definition, the ephemerides in SPK files are continuous: the user can
   obtain states at any epoch within the interval of coverage. Epochs are
   always specified in ephemeris seconds past the epoch of the J2000
   reference system (Julian Ephemeris Date 2451545.0 ) For example, to
   determine the state of Triton as seen from Voyager-2 at Julian Ephemeris
   Date 2447751.8293,
<p>
 
</p><pre>   et = ( 2447751.8293d0 - j2000() ) * <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spd_c.html">spd_c</a>();
 
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> ( "triton",    et,    "j2000", &lt;aberr&gt;,
              "voyager-2", state, &amp;lt              ); { Easier state }
</pre>
   where the function J2000 returns the epoch of the J2000 frame (Julian
   Ephemeris Date 2451545.0) and the function SPD returns the number of
   seconds per Julian day (86400.0).
<p>
 
   The ephemeris data in an SPK file may be referenced to a number of
   different reference frames. States returned by <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> do not have to
   be referenced to any of these ``native'' frames. The user can specify
   that states are to be returned in any of the frames recognized by the
   frame subsystem. For example, to determine the state of Triton as seen
   from Voyager-2, referenced to the J2000 ecliptic reference frame,
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> ( "triton", et,          "eclipj2000",
              aberr,    "voyager-2", state,
              &amp;lt                                 ); { Easier state }
</pre>
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> returns apparent, true, or geometric states depending on the
   value of the aberration correction type flag `aberr'.
<p>
 
   Apparent states are corrected for planetary aberration, which is the
   composite of the apparent angular displacement produced by motion of the
   observer (stellar aberration) and the actual motion of the target body
   (correction for light-time). True states are corrected for light-time
   only. Geometric states are uncorrected.
</p><p>
 
   Instead of using the potentially confusing terms `true' and `geometric'
   to specify the type of state to be returned, <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> requires the
   specific corrections to be named. To compute apparent states, specify
   correction for both light-time and stellar aberration: `LT+S'. To
   compute true states, specify correction for light-time only: `LT'. To
   compute geometric states, specify no correction: `NONE'.
</p><p>
 
   In all cases, the one-way light-time from the target to the observer is
   returned along with the state.
</p><p>

</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Computing States using Constant-Velocity or Constant-Position Objects
</h3><p><br><br>
   Objects such as tracking stations, rover or spacecraft components, or
   fixed surface points can be treated by the SPK subsystem as ephemeris
   objects just as easily as bodies such as planets and natural satellites.
   For example, using an SPK file for the geocentric location of a tracking
   station enables <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> to compute states of targets relative to the
   tracking station, providing all needed kernel data have been loaded.
</p><p>
 
   However, it is not always convenient to create an SPK file to provide
   data for an ephemeris object, particularly when that object's location
   is known only at run time.
</p><p>
 
   For an object that has constant velocity, relative to a specified center
   of motion, in a specified reference frame, CSPICE offers a set of
   functions to compute states relative to other ephemeris objects, where
   the other objects have ephemeris data provided by SPK files:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkcpo_c.html">spkcpo_c</a>  {SPK, constant position observer state}
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkcpt_c.html">spkcpt_c</a>  {SPK, constant position target state}
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkcvo_c.html">spkcvo_c</a>  {SPK, constant velocity observer state}
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkcvt_c.html">spkcvt_c</a>  {SPK, constant velocity target state}
</pre>
   The ``constant position'' routines have simplified interfaces; these
   handle the special case where the constant velocity is zero.
<p>
 
   Each of the above functions requires that sufficient SPK data be
   available to compute the state of the center of motion, relative to the
   other ephemeris object, of the constant-velocity or constant-position
   object.
</p><p>
 
   States computed by SPK functions for constant-velocity or
   constant-position objects optionally can be corrected for light time and
   stellar aberration, just as is done by <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>.
</p><p>
 
   A limitation of representing objects using constant velocities or
   positions, instead of creating SPK files to provide the ephemerides of
   those objects, is that high-level CSPICE geometry routines such as
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/sincpt_c.html">sincpt_c</a> or <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/subpt_c.html">subpt_c</a> cannot work with such objects---these functions
   require SPK data for all ephemeris objects participating in the
   computations they perform.

<a name="The Computation of Light Time"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> The Computation of Light Time
</h3><p><br><br>
   The light time corrected position component of a state vector returned
   by the SPK system is the 3-vector difference
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   TARGET_SSB ( ET + S*LT )  - OBSERVER_SSB ( ET )
</pre>
   where TARGET_SSB and OBSERVER_SSB give the position of the target and
   observer relative to the solar system barycenter, and where S is -1 for
   reception corrections (where light travels from the target to the
   observer) and 1 for transmission corrections (where light travels from
   the observer to the target).
<p>
 
   LT is the unique number that satisfies:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>         | TARGET_SSB ( ET + S*LT )  -  OBSERVER_SSB ( ET ) |
   LT =  ----------------------------------------------------
                           Speed of Light
</pre>
   where
<p>
 
</p><pre>   | position |
</pre>
   indicates the length of a position vector.
<p>
 
   The velocity portion of the returned state is the derivative with
   respect to the observation time ET of the light time corrected position.
</p><p>
 
   Mathematically, LT can be computed to arbitrary precision via the
   following algorithm:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   LT_0 = 0
 
 
 
           | TARGET_SSB ( ET - LT_(i-1) ) - OBSERVER_SSB ( ET ) |
   LT_i =  ------------------------------------------------------
                              Speed of Light
 
 
      for i = 1, ...
</pre>
   It can be shown that the sequence LT_0, LT_1, LT_2, ... converges to LT
   geometrically. Moreover, it can be shown that the difference between
   LT_i and LT satisfies the following inequality.
<p>
 
</p><pre>                                 i
   | LT - LT_i | &lt; LT_i * ( V/C )  / ( 1 - V/C )
 
      for i = 1, ...
</pre>
   where V is the maximum speed of the target body with respect to the
   solar system barycenter and C is the speed of light.
<p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Precision of Light Time Computations"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Precision of Light Time Computations
</h3><p><br><br>
   Let's examine the error we make if we use LT_2 as an approximation for
   LT. This is an analysis of precision; we'll ignore errors in the data
   and those in the input times.
</p><p>
 
   For nearly all objects in the solar system V is less than 60 km/sec. The
   value of C is approximately 300000 km/sec. Thus V/C is 2.0E-4, and the
   one iteration solution for LT (in which the target-SSB vector is
   corrected once) has a potential relative error of not more than 4.0E-8.
   This is a potential light time error of approximately 2.0E-5 seconds per
   astronomical unit of distance separating the observer and target. Thus
   as long as the observer and target are separated by less than 50
   Astronomical Units, the error in the light time returned using option
   `LT' is less than 1 millisecond.
</p><p>
 
   For this reason, CSPICE uses LT_2 to approximate LT when you request a
   light time corrected state by setting the aberration correction argument
   in <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> to any of `LT', `XLT', `LT+S', `XLT+S'.
</p><p>
 
   The maximum error in the light time corrected target-SSB position vector
   is larger by a factor of C/V than V times the maximum relative light
   time error. This is because the (i-1)st light time estimate is used to
   compute the ith estimate of target-SSB position vector. Given the
   assumptions above, the maximum position error for the `LT'-style
   correction is bounded by
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   60 km/s * (1/(2.0E-4)) * 2*1.0E-5 s / AU
</pre>
   or 6 km per astronomical unit of distance separating the observer and
   target.
<p>
 
   In practice, the difference between positions obtained using
   one-iteration and converged light time is usually much smaller than the
   value computed above and can be insignificant. For example, for the
   spacecraft Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and Mars Express, the position
   error for the one-iteration light time correction, applied to the
   spacecraft-to-Mars center
</p><p>
 
   You can make <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> (and other applicable SPK functions) compute a
   better approximation to LT and compute more accurate light-time
   corrected states by commanding that it compute a ``converged Newtonian''
   value for LT. To do this set the light time portion of the aberration
   correction specification to `CN' (the possible such aberration
   correction specifications are`CN', `XCN', `CN+S', or `XCN+S'). <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>
   will then return a converged value, usually equal to LT_4, as the
   approximation for light time; the returned state will be converged as
   well. Then the maximum error in LT_4 is less than
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   1.0E-3 * (V/C)**2 seconds
</pre>
   which is less than 4e-11 seconds for any observer/target pair in the
   solar system that satisfies the assumptions above. The corresponding
   position error bound is 1.2 cm at a separation of 50 AU.
<p>
 
   However, you should note that this is a purely Newtonian approximation
   to the light time. To model the actual light time between target and
   observer one must take into account effects due to General relativity.
   These may be as high as a few hundredths of a millisecond for some
   geometric cases.
</p><p>
 
   The functions in the SPK family do not attempt to perform either general
   or special relativistic corrections in computing the various aberration
   corrections. For many applications relativistic corrections are not
   worth the expense of added computation cycles. If, however, your
   application requires these additional corrections we suggest you consult
   the astronomical almanac (page B36) for a discussion of how to carry out
   these corrections.

<a name="Light Time Corrected Non-Inertial States"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Light Time Corrected Non-Inertial States
</h3><p><br><br>
   When we observe a distant object, we don't see it as it is at the moment
   of observation. We see it as it was when the photons we have sensed were
   emitted by or reflected from the object. Thus when we look at Mars
   through a telescope, we see it not as it is now, but rather as it was
   one ``light-time'' ago. This is true not only for the position of Mars,
   but for its orientation as well.
</p><p>
 
   Suppose that a large balloon has been launched into the Martian
   atmosphere and we want to determine the Mars bodyfixed state of the
   balloon as seen from Earth at the epoch ET. We need to determine both
   the light time corrected position of the balloon, and the light time
   corrected orientation of Mars. To do this we compute two light times.
   The light time to the center of the Mars bodyfixed frame (i.e. the
   center of Mars) and the light time to the balloon. Call the light time
   to the center of the Mars frame LT_F and call the light time to the
   balloon LT_T. The light time corrected state of the balloon relative to
   the Mars bodyfixed frame is the location of the balloon at ET - LT_T in
   the bodyfixed frame of Mars as oriented at ET - LT_F.
</p><p>
 
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> carries out all of these computations automatically. In this
   case the computation would be computed by a function call similar to
   this:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> ( "mars_balloon",  &lt;et&gt;,  "iau_mars", "lt",
              "earth",         state, &amp;lt              );
</pre>
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> uses the following rules when computing states.
<p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> When no corrections are requested from <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> (ABCORR = 'NONE'), the
state of the target is determined at the request time ET and is represented
in the specified reference frame as it is oriented at time ET.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> When light time corrections are requested from <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> (ABCORR = 'LT'),
two light times are determined: LT_F the light time to the center of the
specified reference frame, and LT_T the light time to the target. The state
of the target is given as it was at ET - LT_T in the frame as it was
oriented at ET - LT_F.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>3.</tt> When light time and stellar aberrations are requested from <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> (ABCORR
= 'LT+S'), both LT_F and LT_T are again computed. The state of the target
at ET - LT_T is corrected for stellar aberration and represented in the
reference frame as it was oriented at ET - LT_F.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>4.</tt> Light-time corrected velocities are computed taking into account the rate
of change of light time both between observer and target and between
observer and the center of the non-inertial frame. The rate of change of
the target frame's orientation is accounted for as well.
<br><br></ul>
   In the actual implementation of <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> a few short cuts are taken.
   When light time requested states relative to an inertial frame are
   requested, the orientation of the frame is not corrected for light time.
   The orientation of an inertial frame at ET - LT_F is the same as the
   orientation of the frame at ET. Computations involving inertial frames
   take advantage of this observation and avoid redundant computations.
<p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="An example"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> An example
</h3><p><br><br>
   Here we illustrate how you could use <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> together with other CSPICE
   functions to determine if at a particular epoch ET the Mars Global
   Surveyor spacecraft is occulted by Mars.
</p><p>
 
   We will need the lengths of the axes of the triaxial ellipsoid that is
   used to model the surface of Mars. Either of the CSPICE functions
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/bodvcd_c.html">bodvcd_c</a> or <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/bodvrd_c.html">bodvrd_c</a> will retrieve this information from a loaded PCK
   file. <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/bodvrd_c.html">bodvrd_c</a> uses the name of the body, while <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/bodvcd_c.html">bodvcd_c</a> uses the NAIF
   ID code for Mars (499) to retrieve the lengths of the axes. We may call
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/bodvcd_c.html">bodvcd_c</a> as shown:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/bodvcd_c.html">bodvcd_c</a> ( 499, "RADII", 3, &amp;nvals, axes );
 
   a = axes[0];
   b = axes[1];
   c = axes[2];
</pre>
   Next we compute the state of Mars relative to Earth and the state of MGS
   relative to Earth in the Mars bodyfixed frame.
<p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> ( "mars",  et,     "iau_mars", "lt+s",
              "earth", marsst, &amp;lt                );
 
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> ( "mgs",   et,     "iau_mars", "lt+s",
              "earth", mgsst,  &amp;lt                ); {Easier State}
</pre>
   Compute the apparent position of the Earth relative to Mars in the
   apparent Mars bodyfixed frame. This means simply negating the components
   of `marsst'. The CSPICE function <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/vminus_c.html">vminus_c</a> carries out this task.
<p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/vminus_c.html">vminus_c</a> ( marsst, estate );
</pre>
   Determine if the line of sight from Earth to MGS intersects the surface
   of Mars. The CSPICE function <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/surfpt_c.html">surfpt_c</a> will find this intersection point
   if it exists.
<p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/surfpt_c.html">surfpt_c</a> ( estate, mgsst, a, b, c, point, &amp;found );
</pre>
   Finally, if a point of intersection was found, was it between the Earth
   and the MGS spacecraft. To find out we can compare the distances between
   the intersection point and the spacecraft. The CSPICE function <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/vnorm_c.html">vnorm_c</a>
   computes the length of the vector from Earth to MGS. The function
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/vdist_c.html">vdist_c</a> computes the distance between the point and the Earth.
<p>
 
</p><pre>   if ( found )
      {
      betwn = (  <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/vdist_c.html">vdist_c</a> ( estate, point ) &lt; <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/vnorm_c.html">vnorm_c</a> ( mgsst )  );
      }
   else
      {
      betwn = SPICEFALSE;
      }
 
 
   if ( betwn )
      {
      printf ( "mgs is behind mars\n" );

<a name="Integer ID Codes Used in SPK"></a>
<p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Integer ID Codes Used in SPK
</h3><p><br><br>
   Low level SPK software uses integer codes to identify ephemeris objects,
   reference frames and data representation, etc. At low levels of the
   SPICE system only integer codes are used to communicate information
   about objects. To some extent, these codes are a historical artifact in
   the design of the SPICE system. Nevertheless, these integer codes
   provide economies in the development of SPICE software.
</p><p>
 
   High-level SPICE software uses names (character strings) to refer to the
   various SPICE objects and translates between names and integer codes.
   Thus to some extent you can disregard the integer codes used by the
   SPICE internals. However, occasionally, due to the introduction of new
   ephemeris objects, the name translation software will be unable to find
   a name associated with an ID code. To retrieve states for such an object
   you will need to use the integer code for the object in question. If you
   are using <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>, you can supply this integer code as a quoted string.
   For example the following two function calls will both return the state
   of TRITON as seen from Voyager-2. (The NAIF integer code for TRITON is
   801; the NAIF integer code for Voyager 2 is -32).

   Note that <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>, <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkez_c.html">spkez_c</a> and <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkgeo_c.html">spkgeo_c</a> do not require the name of an
   SPK file as input. These functions rely on the lower level routine in
   the SPK subsystem to maintain a database of ephemeris files. Your
   application program indicates which files are to be used by passing
   their names to function <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> -- ``generic loader'' that can be used
   to load SPICE kernel files of any type.

</pre>
   In general, a state returned by <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a> is built from several more
   primitive states. Consider the following diagram, which shows some of
   the states that might be needed to determine the state of the Galileo
   spacecraft as seen from Earth:
<p>
 
</p><pre>            Jupiter_Barycenter --- Europa
            /                       \
           /                         \
          /                          Spacecraft
         /
        /
       /
      /
   SSB
      \
       \
        \
        EMB --- Earth
</pre>
   (SSB and EMB are the solar system and Earth-Moon barycenters.)
<p>
 
   Each state is computed from a distinct segment. The segments may reside
   in a single SPK file, or may be contained in as many as five separate
   files. For example, the segments needed to compute the Earth-spacecraft
   state shown above might come from the following set of files:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> ( "barycenters.bsp"    );  { Load kernel file }

<h3> Data Precedence
</h3><p><br><br>
   An SPK file may contain any number of segments. A single file may
   contain overlapping segments: segments containing data for the same body
   over a common interval. When this happens, the latest segment in a file
   supersedes any competing segments earlier in the file. Similarly, the
   latest file loaded supersedes any earlier files. In effect, several
   loaded files become equivalent to one large file.

<br><br>
<a name="Unloading Files"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Unloading Files
</h3><p><br><br>
   The number of SPK files that may be loaded at any one time is limited
   but very large -- up to 1000 total for all loaded SPK, CK, and binary
   PCK files combined. Although unlikely, in some cases your application
   program may need to unload some SPK files to make room for others or to
   remove a particular SPK from the set of loaded data. An SPK file may be
   unloaded by supplying its name to function <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/unload_c.html">unload_c</a> -- ``generic
   unloader'' that can be used to unload SPICE kernel of any type. The
   sequence of statements shown below,
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> ( "file.a" );     { Load kernel file }

<h3> Getting Coverage Summary
</h3><p><br><br>
   The CSPICE includes two functions for obtaining information about the
   contents of an SPK file from within an application.
</p><p>
 
   The <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkobj_c.html">spkobj_c</a> function provides an API via which an application can find
   the set of bodies for which a specified SPK file contains data. The body
   IDs are returned in a SPICE ``set'' data structure (see <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/sets.html">sets.req</a>).
</p><p>
 
   The <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkcov_c.html">spkcov_c</a> function provides an API via which an application can find
   the time periods for which a specified SPK file provides data for an
   body of interest. The coverage information is a set of disjoint time
   intervals returned in a SPICE ``window'' data structure (see
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/windows.html">windows.req</a>).

<h3> Loading Auxiliary Files
</h3><p><br><br>
   Prior to the inclusion of non-inertial frames in the SPK system, the
   states of objects computed by the SPK system required only that you load
   the correct SPK files and call the correct functions. The inertial frame
   transformations needed for converting from one inertial frame to another
   are ``hard wired'' into the SPICE system. The transformations are part
   of the object code of the CSPICE library---no additional data need be
   supplied to compute these transformations. This approach to carrying out
   inertial frame transformations was chosen because the transformations
   are compactly represented and do not change as the result of further
   observations. They are essentially definitions.
</p><p>
 
   On the other hand, the orientation of non-inertial frames with respect
   to other frames are almost always the result of observation. They are
   improved and extended as further observations are made. For some of
   these frames (such as spacecraft fixed frames) vary large data sets are
   needed to express the orientation of the frame with respect to other
   frames. Frame transformations that are a function of time and require
   megabytes of data are not suitable for encapsulation in C or FORTRAN
   source code. As a result, in the SPICE system, the computation of
   non-inertial frame transformations depends upon data stored in other
   SPICE kernels. If you request states relative to a non-inertial frame or
   use ephemerides that are represented relative to non-inertial frames you
   must load additional SPICE kernels. The method by which an auxiliary
   kernel is loaded depends upon the type of the kernel.
</p><p>
 
   There are currently five classes of reference frames that are supported
   by the SPICE system. We give a brief overview of these frames here. For
   a more thorough discussion of the various types of frames see the
   recommended reading file ``<a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/frames.html">frames.req</a>.''
</p><p>
 
   Inertial frames
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>  </tt> Inertial frames are built into the SPICE system. You don't need to do
anything to make their definitions available to your program. Inertial
frames have NAIF ID codes whose values are in the range from 1 to 10000.
<br><br></ul>
   PCK frames
<p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>  </tt> PCK frames are bodyfixed frames. The orientation of a PCK frame is always
expressed relative to an inertial frame. The relationship between a PCK
frame and its associated inertial frame is provided by a PCK kernel. PCK
frames have ID codes between 10000 and 100000. There are two types of PCK
kernels---binary and text. Binary PCK kernels are loaded (and unloaded) in
a fashion analogous to the loading and unloading of SPK files. To load a
binary PCK file

</pre>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> text based PCK files are loaded via the function <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.
<br><br></ul>
<pre>            <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> ( &lt;file&gt; )
</pre>
   CK Frames
<p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>  </tt> CK frames are frames that are defined relative to a spacecraft structure.
The orientation of the structure is provided through a binary SPICE kernel
called a C-kernel. The ID codes for C-kernel frames are negative and
usually less than -999. A C-kernel frame may be defined relative to any
other kind of frame. (Most existing C-kernels are defined relative to
inertial frames.)
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> C-kernels are loaded and unloaded using the same loader functions as used
to load and unload SPK kernels. To load a C-kernel
<br><br></ul>
<pre>            <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> ( &lt;file&gt; );

</pre>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> The times used to represent C-kernels are spacecraft clock times---not ET.
The relationship between ET and spacecraft clock times is stored in a SPICE
text kernel called a spacecraft clock kernel---usually abbreviated as SCLK
(ess-clock) kernel. To retrieve states relative to a CK frame you need to
make the relationship between ET and the spacecraft clock available to your
program by loading the appropriate SCLK kernel. SCLK kernels are loaded via
the function <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.
<br><br></ul>
<pre>            <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> ( &lt;sclk_file_name&gt; );
</pre>
   TK Frames
<p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>  </tt> TK frames (short for Text Kernel frames) are frames that are defined via a
SPICE text kernel. These frames can be transformed to another reference
frame via a constant rotation matrix. Typical examples are topocentric
frames and instrument frames. TK frames are loaded via the function
<a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.
<br><br></ul>
<pre>            <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> ( &lt;TK_frame_file&gt; );
</pre>
   Dynamic Frames
<p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>  </tt> Dynamic frames, like TK frames, are defined via a SPICE text kernel. A
dynamic frame has time-varying rotation relative to its base frame. A
dynamic frame can be defined by two time-varying vectors, by a set of
precession, nutation, and obliquity models, or by a set of Euler angles.
Typical examples are the geocentric solar ecliptic frame or the Earth true
equator and true equinox of date frame. Dynamic frames are loaded via the
function <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>.
<br><br></ul>
<pre>            <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a> ( &lt;Dynamic_frame_file&gt; );
</pre>
   In addition to the files mentioned above, it may be necessary to load a
   ``frame definition'' file along with the one of the SPICE kernels listed
   above. (If the producer of the file has done his or her homework this
   step should be unnecessary.) The frame definition file is a SPICE text
   kernel that specifies the type of the frame, the center of the frame,
   the name of the frame, and its ID code. (See <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/frames.html">frames.req</a> for more details
   concerning frame definitions.)
<p>
 
   As is evident from the above discussion, the use of non-inertial frames
   requires more data management on the part of the user of the SPICE
   system. However, this data management problem is not a new problem. In
   previous versions of the SPICE system the same kernels would have been
   required. Moreover, in previous versions of the SPICE system, you would
   have been required to perform all non-inertial transformations in your
   own code. With the inclusion of non-inertial frames in the SPK system,
   we have relieved you of some of the tasks associated with non-inertial
   frames.

<a name="SPK File Structure"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h2> SPK File Structure
</h2><hr align="LEFT" width="50%"><p><br><br>
   An SPK file is made up of one or more data ``segments'' and a
   ``comment'' area. These components are described below.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Segments--The Fundamental SPK Building Blocks"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Segments--The Fundamental SPK Building Blocks
</h3><p><br><br>
   An SPK file contains one or more ``segments.'' Each segment contains
   ephemeris data sufficient to compute the geometric state (position and
   velocity) of one solar system body (the `target') with respect to
   another (the `center') at any epoch throughout some finite interval of
   time.
</p><p>
 
   Either body may be a spacecraft, a planet or planet barycenter, a
   satellite, a comet, an asteroid, a tracking station, a roving vehicle,
   or an arbitrary point for which an ephemeris has been calculated. Each
   body in the solar system is associated with a unique integer code. A
   list of names and codes for the planets, major satellites, spacecraft,
   asteroids and comets can be found in the document <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/naif_ids.html">naif_ids.req</a>
</p><p>
 
   The states computed from the ephemeris data in a segment must be
   referenced to a single, recognized reference frame.
</p><p>
 
   The data in each segment are stored as an array of double precision
   numbers. The summary for the array, called a `descriptor', has two
   double precision components:
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> The initial epoch of the interval for which ephemeris data are contained in
the segment, given in ephemeris seconds past Julian year 2000.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> The final epoch of the interval for which ephemeris data are contained in
the segment, given in ephemeris seconds past Julian year 2000.
<br><br></ul>
   The descriptor has six integer components:
<p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> The NAIF integer code for the target.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> The NAIF integer code for the center.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>3.</tt> The NAIF integer code for the reference frame.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>4.</tt> The integer code for the representation (type of ephemeris data).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>5.</tt> The initial address of the array.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>6.</tt> The final address of the array.
<br><br></ul>
   In addition to a descriptor, each array also has a name. The name of
   each array may contain up to 40 characters. This space may be used to
   store a brief description of the segment. For example, the name may
   contain pedigree information concerning the segment or may contain the
   name of the object whose position is recorded in the segment.
<p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Segment Order and Priority"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Segment Order and Priority
</h3><p><br><br>
   Segments within an SPK file need not be ordered according to time;
   segments covering (that is, providing data for) a later time period may
   precede segments covering an earlier time period.
</p><p>
 
   However, segment order does imply priority. For a given target body,
   segment priority increases with distance from the start of the file:
   segments closer to the end of the file have higher priority than
   segments for the same target body that occur earlier in the file. When a
   data request for a specified target body is made, the segment for that
   target body with highest priority, and whose time interval includes the
   request time, will be selected to satisfy the request.
</p><p>
 
   SPK producers should note that this priority scheme would cause a higher
   priority segment for a target body to mask a lower priority segment for
   the same body over the intersection of the coverage intervals of the two
   segments, if two such segments were written to an SPK file. In
   particular, if an SPK file contained two segments for the same target
   body and time interval, where the segments had different central bodies,
   the lower priority segment would be invisible to the SPK system.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="The Comment Area"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> The Comment Area
</h3><p><br><br>
   Preceding the `segments', the Comment Area provides space in the SPK
   file for storing textual information besides what is written in the
   array names. Ideally, each SPK file would contain internal documentation
   that describes the origin, recommended use, and any other pertinent
   information about the data in that file. For example, the beginning and
   ending epochs for the file, the names and NAIF integer codes of the
   bodies included, an accuracy estimate, the date the file was produced,
   and the names of the source files used in making the SPK file could be
   included in the Comment Area.
</p><p>
 
   The utility programs COMMNT and SPACIT may be used to examine and
   manipulate the comments in an SPK file. In addition to these utilities,
   CSPICE provides a family of functions for handling this Comment Area.
   The name of each function in this family begins with the letters `SPC'
   which stand for `SPk and Ck' because this feature is common to both
   types of files. The SPC software provides the ability to add, extract,
   read, and delete comments and convert commented files from binary format
   to SPICE transfer format and back to binary again.
</p><p>
 
   The SPC functions and their functions are described in detail in the SPC
   Required Reading, <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/spc.html">spc.req</a>.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="SPK Data Types"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> SPK Data Types
</h3><p><br><br>
   The fourth integer component of the descriptor---the code for the
   representation, or `data type'---is the key to the SPK format.
</p><p>
 
   For purposes of determining the segment best suited to fulfill a
   particular request, all segments are treated equally. It is only when
   the data in a segment are to be evaluated---when a state vector is to be
   computed---that the type of data used to represent the ephemeris becomes
   important.
</p><p>
 
   Because this step is isolated within a single low-level reader,
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkpvn_c.html">spkpvn_c</a>, new data types can be added to the SPK format without
   affecting application programs that use the higher level readers.
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkpvn_c.html">spkpvn_c</a> is designed so that the changes required to implement a new
   data type are minimal.
</p><p>
 
   There are no real limits on the possible representations that can be
   used for ephemeris data. Users with access to data suitable for creating
   an ephemeris may choose to invent their own representations, adapting
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkpvn_c.html">spkpvn_c</a> accordingly. (We recommend that you consult with NAIF prior to
   implementing an new data type.)
</p><p>
 
   The data types currently supported by CSPICE software are listed under
   ``Supported Data Types'' later in this document.

<h2> Primitive States
</h2><hr align="LEFT" width="50%"><p><br><br>
   At the lowest level, it is possible to compute states without combining
   them at all. Given the handle and descriptor for a particular segment,
   function <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkpvn_c.html">spkpvn_c</a> returns a state from that segment directly.
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkpvn_c.html">spkpvn_c</a> ( &lt;handle&gt;,
              &lt;descr&gt;,
              &lt;et&gt;,
              ref,
              state,
              center   );  { Position, velocity, native frame }
</pre>
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkpvn_c.html">spkpvn_c</a> is the most basic SPK reader. It returns states relative to the
   frame in which they are stored in the SPK file. It does not rotate or
   combine them: it returns a state relative to the center whose integer
   code is stored in the descriptor for the segment. This state is relative
   to the frame whose integer ID code is also stored in the descriptor of
   the segment. The user is responsible for using that state correctly.
<p>
 
   The user is also responsible for using DAF functions to determine the
   particular file and segment from which each state is to be computed.
</p><p>
 
   Note that to use the state returned by <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkpvn_c.html">spkpvn_c</a> in any frame other than
   the ``native frame'' of the segment, you must convert the state to the
   frame of interest.
</p><p>
 
   If files have been loaded by previous calls to <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/furnsh_c.html">furnsh_c</a>, it is possible
   to use the same segments that would normally be used by <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkezr_c.html">spkezr_c</a>,
   <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkez_c.html">spkez_c</a>, spkssb_c, and <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkgeo_c.html">spkgeo_c</a>. Function <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spksfs_c.html">spksfs_c</a> selects, from the
   database of loaded files, the file handle and segment descriptor for the
   segment best suited to the request. If two segments from different files
   are suitable, <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spksfs_c.html">spksfs_c</a> selects the one from the file that was loaded
   later. If two segments from the same file are suitable, <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spksfs_c.html">spksfs_c</a> selects
   the one that is stored later in the file. The call

              segnam,
              &amp;found );     { Select file and segment }
</pre>
   returns the handle, descriptor, and segment name for the latest segment
   containing data for Triton at the specified epoch. <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spksfs_c.html">spksfs_c</a> maintains a
   buffer of segment descriptors and segment names, so it doesn't waste
   time searching the database for bodies it already knows about.

<a name="Example 1: Computing Latitude and Longitude"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Example 1: Computing Latitude and Longitude
</h3><p><br><br>
   The next several sections present sample programs to show how the SPK
   readers can be used to compute state vectors, and how those vectors can
   be used to compute derived quantities.
</p><p>
 
   All functions used in the examples are from CSPICE. The convention of
   expanding SPK function names will be dropped for these examples.
</p><p>
 
   The first example program computes the planetocentric latitude and
   longitude of the sub-observer point on a target body for any combination
   of observer, target, and epoch. (Note that planetocentric coordinates
   differ from planetographic and cartographic coordinates in that they are
   always right-handed, regardless of the rotation of the body. Also note
   that for this example we define the sub-observer point to be the point
   on the ``surface'' of the target that lies on the ray from the center of
   the target to the observer. )

   The second example determines epochs if one target body (spacecraft,

<h2> Supported Data Types
</h2><hr align="LEFT" width="50%"><p><br><br>
   The following representations, or data types, are currently supported by
   the SPK functions in CSPICE.
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> Modified Difference Arrays.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> Created by the JPL Orbit Determination Program (ODP), these are used
primarily for spacecraft ephemerides.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> Chebyshev polynomials (position only).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> These are sets of coefficients for the x, y, and z components of the body
position. The velocity of the body is obtained by differentiation. This
data type is normally used for planet barycenters, and for satellites whose
orbits are integrated.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>3.</tt> Chebyshev polynomials (position and velocity).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> These are sets of coefficients for the x, y, and z components of the body
position, and for the corresponding components of the velocity. This data
type is normally used for satellites whose orbits are computed directly
from theories.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>4.</tt> Reserved for future use (TRW elements for TDRS and Space Telescope).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>5.</tt> Discrete states (two body propagation).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> This data type contains discrete state vectors. A state is obtained for a
specified epoch by propagating the state vectors to that epoch according to
the laws of two body motion and then taking a weighted average of the
resulting states. Normally, this data type is used for comets and
asteroids, whose ephemerides are integrated from an initial state or set of
osculating elements.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>6.</tt> Reserved for future use (Analytic Model for Phobos and Deimos).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>7.</tt> Reserved for future use (Precessing Classical Elements---used by STScI).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>8.</tt> Equally spaced discrete states (Lagrange interpolation)
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> This data type contains discrete state vectors whose time tags are
separated by a constant step size. A state is obtained for a specified
epoch by finding a set of states `centered' at that epoch and using
Lagrange interpolation on each component of the states.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>9.</tt> Unequally spaced discrete states (Lagrange interpolation)
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> This data type contains discrete state vectors whose time tags may be
unequally spaced. A state is obtained for a specified epoch by finding a
set of states `centered' at that epoch and using Lagrange interpolation on
each component of the states.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>10.</tt> Space Command Two-line Elements (Short Period Orbits)
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> This data type contains Space Command two-line element representations for
objects in Earth orbit (formally called NORAD two-line elements).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>11.</tt> Reserved for future use.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>12.</tt> Hermite Interpolation Uniform Spacing.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>13.</tt> Hermite Interpolation Non-uniform Spacing.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>14.</tt> Chebyshev polynomials non-uniform spacing (position and velocity).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> This data type contains Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for the position
and velocity of an object. Unlike SPK Types 2 and 3, the time intervals to
which polynomial coefficient sets apply do not have uniform duration.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>15.</tt> Precessing conic propagation.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> This data type allows for first order precession of the line of apsides and
regression of the line of nodes due to the effects of the J2 coefficient in
the harmonic expansion of the gravitational potential of an oblate
spheroid.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>16.</tt> Reserved for future use (Elements for European Space Agency's ISO
spacecraft).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>17.</tt> Equinoctial Elements
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> This data type represents the motion of an object about another using
equinoctial elements. It provides for precession of the line of apsides and
regression of the line of nodes. Unlike Type 15, the mean motion,
regression of the nodes and precession of the line of apsides are not
derived from the gravitational properties of the central body, but are
empirical values.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>18.</tt> ESOC/DDID Hermite/Lagrange Interpolation
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> This data type has been provided to support accurate duplication within the
SPK system of spacecraft ephemerides used by the European Space Agency
(ESA) on the Mars Express, Rosetta, SMART-1, and Venus express missions.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>19.</tt> ESOC/DDID Piecewise Interpolation
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> SPK type 19 is an enhanced version of SPK type 18. Type 19 enables creation
of SPK files representing the same ephemerides that can be represented
using type 18, but containing far fewer segments. Data from multiple type
18 segments can be stored in a single type 19 segment.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>20.</tt> Chebyshev (velocity only)
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> SPK data type 20 contains Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for the
velocity of a body, relative to its center of motion, as a function of
time. The position of the body is obtained by integrating the velocity
using a specified integration constant. This data type is provided to
accurately represent ``EPM'' ephemerides developed by the Institute of
Applied Astronomy (IAA), Russian Academy of Sciences (RAS).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>21.</tt> Extended Modified Difference Arrays
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> SPK data type 21 contains extended Modified Difference Arrays (MDA), also
called ``difference lines.'' These data structures use the same
mathematical trajectory representation as SPK data type 1, but type 21
allows use of larger, higher-degree MDAs.
<br><br></ul>
   Because SPK files are Double Precision Array Files (DAFs), each segment
   is stored as an array. Each array corresponding to a particular data
   type has a particular internal structure. These structures (for the
   non-reserved types) are described below.
<p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Type 1: Modified Difference Arrays"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Type 1: Modified Difference Arrays
</h3><p><br><br>
   The first SPK data type contains Modified Difference Arrays (MDA),
   sometimes called `difference lines'. This data type is normally used for
   spacecraft whose ephemerides are produced by JPL's principal trajectory
   integrator---DPTRAJ. Difference lines are extracted from the spacecraft
   trajectory file (`P-files' and `PV-files') created by DPTRAJ.
</p><p>
 
   Each segment containing Modified Difference Arrays contains an arbitrary
   number of logical records. Each record contains difference line
   coefficients valid up to some final epoch, along with the state at that
   epoch. The contents of the records themselves are described in [163].
   The function spke01_ contains the algorithm used to construct a state
   from a particular record and epoch.
</p><p>
 
   The records within a segment are ordered by increasing final epoch. The
   final epochs associated with the records must be distinct.
</p><p>
 
   A segment of this type is structured as follows:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   +-----------------------------------------+
   | Record 1 (difference line coefficients) |
   +-----------------------------------------+
   | Record 2 (difference line coefficients) |
   +-----------------------------------------+
     .
     .
     .
   +-----------------------------------------+
   | Record N (difference line coefficients) |
   +-----------------------------------------+
   | Epoch 1                      |
   +------------------------------+
   | Epoch 2                      |
   +------------------------------+
     .
     .
     .
   +------------------------------+
   | Epoch N                      |
   +------------------------------+
   | Epoch 100                    |   (First directory epoch)
   +------------------------------+
   | Epoch 200                    |   (Second directory epoch)
   +------------------------------+
     .
     .
     .
   +------------------------------+
   | Epoch (N/100)*100            |   (Final directory epoch)
   +------------------------------+
   | N                            |
   +------------------------------+
</pre>
   The number of records in a segment, N, can be arbitrarily large.
<p>
 
   Records 1 through N contain the difference line coefficients and other
   constants needed to compute state data. Each one of these records
   contains 71 double precision numbers.
</p><p>
 
   The list of final epochs for the records is stored immediately after the
   last record.
</p><p>
 
   Following the list of epochs is a second list, the `directory',
   containing every 100th epoch from the previous list. If there are N
   epochs, there will be N/100 directory epochs. If there are fewer than
   100 epochs, then the segment will not contain any directory epochs.
   Directory epochs are used to speed up access to desired records.
</p><p>
 
   The final element in the segment is the number of records contained in
   the segment, N.
</p><p>
 
   The index of the record corresponding to a particular epoch is the index
   of the first epoch not less than the target epoch.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Type 2: Chebyshev (position only)"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Type 2: Chebyshev (position only)
</h3><p><br><br>
   The second SPK data type contains Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for
   the position of the body as a function of time. Normally, this data type
   is used for planet barycenters, and for satellites whose ephemerides are
   integrated. (The velocity of the body is obtained by differentiating the
   position.)
</p><p>
 
   Each segment contains an arbitrary number of logical records. Each
   record contains a set of Chebyshev coefficients valid throughout an
   interval of fixed length. The function spke02_ contains the algorithm
   used to construct a state from a particular record and epoch.
</p><p>
 
   The records within a segment are ordered by increasing initial epoch.
   All records contain the same number of coefficients. A segment of this
   type is structured as follows:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   +---------------+
   | Record 1      |
   +---------------+
   | Record 2      |
   +---------------+
     .
     .
     .
   +---------------+
   | Record N      |
   +---------------+
   | INIT          |
   +---------------+
   | INTLEN        |
   +---------------+
   | RSIZE         |
   +---------------+
   | N             |
   +---------------+
</pre>
   A four-number `directory' at the end of the segment contains the
   information needed to determine the location of the record corresponding
   to a particular epoch.
<p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> INIT is the initial epoch of the first record, given in ephemeris seconds
past J2000.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> INTLEN is the length of the interval covered by each record, in seconds.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>3.</tt> RSIZE is the total size of (number of array elements in) each record.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>4.</tt> N is the number of records contained in the segment.
<br><br></ul>
   Each record is structured as follows:
<p>
 
</p><pre>   +------------------+
   | MID              |
   +------------------+
   | RADIUS           |
   +------------------+
   | X  coefficients  |
   +------------------+
   | Y  coefficients  |
   +------------------+
   | Z  coefficients  |
   +------------------+
</pre>
   The first two elements in the record, MID and RADIUS, are the midpoint
   and radius of the time interval covered by coefficients in the record.
   These are used as parameters to perform transformations between the
   domain of the record (from MID - RADIUS to MID + RADIUS) and the domain
   of Chebyshev polynomials (from -1 to 1 ).
<p>
 
   The same number of coefficients is always used for each component, and
   all records are the same size (RSIZE), so the degree of each polynomial
   is
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   ( RSIZE - 2 ) / 3 - 1
</pre>
   To facilitate the creation of Type 2 segments, a segment writing
   function called <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkw02_c.html">spkw02_c</a> has been provided. This function takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the function provides a complete
   description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.
<p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Type 3: Chebyshev (position and velocity)"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Type 3: Chebyshev (position and velocity)
</h3><p><br><br>
   The third SPK data type contains Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for
   the position and velocity of the body as a function of time. Normally,
   this data type is used for satellites for which the ephemerides are
   computed from analytical theories.
</p><p>
 
   The structure of the segment is nearly identical to that of the SPK data
   Type 2 (Chebyshev polynomials for position only). The only difference is
   that each logical record contains six sets of coefficients instead of
   three. The function spke03_ contains the algorithm used to construct a
   state from a particular record and epoch.
</p><p>
 
   Each record is structured as follows:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   +------------------+
   | MID              |
   +------------------+
   | RADIUS           |

   +------------------+
   | X' coefficients  |
   +------------------+
   | Y' coefficients  |
   +------------------+
   | Z' coefficients  |
   +------------------+
</pre>
   The same number of coefficients is always used for each component, and
   all records are the same size (RSIZE), so the degree of each polynomial
   is
<p>
 
</p><pre>   ( RSIZE - 2 ) / 6 - 1
</pre>
   To facilitate the creation of Type 3 segments, a segment writing
   function called <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkw03_c.html">spkw03_c</a> has been provided. This function takes as input

<a name="Type 5: Discrete states (two body propagation)"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Type 5: Discrete states (two body propagation)
</h3><p><br><br>
   The fifth standard SPK data type contains discrete state vectors. A
   state is obtained from a Type 5 segment for any epoch that is within the
   bounds of that segment by propagating the discrete states to the
   specified epoch according to the laws of two body motion. Normally, this
   data type is used for comets and asteroids, whose ephemerides are
   integrated from an initial state or set of osculating elements.
</p><p>
 
   Each segment contains of a number of logical records. Each record
   consists of an epoch (ephemeris seconds past J2000) and the geometric
   state of the body at that epoch (x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, in
   kilometers and kilometers per second). Records are ordered with respect
   to increasing time.
</p><p>
 
   The records that correspond to an epoch for which a state is desired are
   the ones whose associated epochs bracket that epoch. The state in each
   record is used as the initial state in a two-body propagation; a
   weighted average of the propagated states gives the position of the body
   at the specified epoch. The velocity is given by the derivative of the
   position. Thus the position and velocity at the specified epoch are
   given by:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   P  = W(t) * P1(t) + (1-W(t)) * P2(t)
 
   V  = W(t) * V1(t) + (1-W(t)) * V2(t) + W'(t) * ( P1(t) - P2(t) )
</pre>
   where P1, V1, P2, and V2 are the position and velocity components of the
   propagated states and W is the weighting function.
<p>
 
   The weighting function used is:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   W(t) = 0.5 + 0.5 * cos [ PI * ( t - t1 ) / ( t2 - t1 ) ]
</pre>
   where t1 and t2 are the epochs that bracket the specified epoch t.
<p>
 
   Physically, the epochs and states are stored separately, so that the
   epochs can be searched as an ordered array. Thus, the initial part of
   each segment looks like this:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   +--------------------+
   | State 1            |
   +--------------------+
            .
            .
            .
   +--------------------+
   | State N            |
   +--------------------+
   | Epoch 1            |
   +--------------------+
            .
            .
            .
   +--------------------+
   | Epoch N            |
   +--------------------+
</pre>
   The number of records in a segment can be arbitrarily large. In order to
   avoid the file reads required to search through a large array of epochs,
   each segment contains a simple directory immediately after the final
   epoch.
<p>
 
   This directory contains every 100th epoch in the epoch array. If there
   are N epochs, there will be N/100 directory epochs. (If there are fewer
   than 100 epochs, no directory epochs are stored.)
</p><p>
 
   The final items in the segment are GM, the gravitational parameter of
   the central body (kilometers and seconds), and N, the number of states
   in the segment. Thus, the complete segment looks like this:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   +--------------------+
   | State 1            |
   +--------------------+
            .
            .
            .
   +--------------------+
   | Epoch 1            |
   +--------------------+
            .
            .
            .
   +--------------------+
   | Epoch N            |
   +--------------------+
   | Epoch 100          |           (First directory epoch)
   +--------------------+
   | Epoch 200          |
   +--------------------+
            .
            .
            .
   +--------------------+
   | Epoch (N/100)*100  |           (Final directory epoch)
   +--------------------+
   | GM                 |
   +--------------------+
   | N                  |
   +--------------------+

<h3> Type 8: Lagrange Interpolation --- Equal Time Steps
</h3><p><br><br>
   The eighth SPK data type represents a continuous ephemeris using a
   discrete set of states and a Lagrange interpolation method. The epochs
   (also called `time tags') associated with the states must be evenly
   spaced: there must be some positive constant STEP such that each time
   tag differs from its predecessor and successor by STEP seconds. For a
   request epoch not corresponding to the time tag of some state, the data
   type defines a state by interpolating each component of a set of states
   whose epochs are `centered' near the request epoch. Details of how these
   states are selected and interpolated are given below.
</p><p>
 
   The SPK system can also represent an ephemeris using unequally spaced
   discrete states and Lagrange interpolation; SPK Type 9 does this. SPK
   Type 9 sacrifices some run-time speed and economy of storage in order to
   achieve greater flexibility.
</p><p>
 
   The states in a Type 8 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The six components of each state vector
   represent the position and velocity (x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, in
   kilometers and kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris
   applies, relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor.
   The epochs corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times
   (TDB), expressed as seconds past J2000.
</p><p>
 
   Each segment also has a polynomial degree associated with it; this is
   the degree of the interpolating polynomials to be used in evaluating
   states based on the data in the segment. The identical degree is used
   for interpolation of each state component.
</p><p>
 
   Type 8 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>                                       +--------+

   | Number of states      |
   +-----------------------+
</pre>
   In the diagram, each box representing a state vector corresponds to six
   double precision numbers; the other boxes represent individual double
   precision numbers. Since the epochs of the states are evenly spaced,
   they are represented by a start epoch and a step size. The number of
   states must be greater than the interpolating polynomial degree.
<p>
 
   The Type 8 interpolation method works as follows: given an epoch at
   which a state is requested and a segment having coverage for that epoch,
   the Type 8 reader finds a group of states whose epochs are `centered'
   about the epoch. The size of the group is one greater than the
   polynomial degree associated with the segment. If the group size N is
   even, then the group will consist of N consecutive states such that the
   request time is between the epochs of the members of the group having
   indices, relative to the start of the group, of N/2 and (N/2 + 1),
   inclusive. When N is odd, the group will contain a central state whose
   epoch is closest to the request time, and will also contain (N-1)/2
   neighboring states on either side of the central one. The Type 8
   evaluator will then use Lagrange interpolation on each component of the
   states to produce a state corresponding to the request time. For the jth
   state component, the interpolation algorithm is mathematically
   equivalent to finding the unique polynomial of degree N-1 that
   interpolates the ordered pairs
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   ( epoch(i), state(j,i) ),  i = k ,  k , ... , k
                                   1    2         N
</pre>
   and evaluating the polynomial at the requested epoch. Here
<p>
 
</p><pre>    k ,  k , ... , k
     1    2         N
</pre>
   are the indices of the states in the interpolation group,
<p>
 
</p><pre>   epoch(i)
</pre>
   is the epoch of the ith state and
<p>
 
</p><pre>   state(j,i)
</pre>
   is the jth component of the ith state.
<p>
 
   There is an exception to the state selection algorithm described above:
   the request time may be too near the first or last state of the segment
   to be properly bracketed. In this case, the set of states selected for
   interpolation still has size N, and includes either the first or last
   state of the segment.

<p>
 
   The set of time tags is augmented by a series of directory entries;
   these entries allow the Type 9 reader to search for states more
   efficiently. The directory entries contain time tags whose indices are
   multiples of 100. The set of indices of time tags stored in the
   directories ranges from 100 to
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   (  (N-1) / 100  ) * 100

   where N is the total number of time tags. Note that if N is

</p><pre>   Q * 100
</pre>
   then only
<p>

   directory entries are stored, and in particular, if there are only 100
   states in the segment, there are no directories.

   The Type 9 interpolation algorithm is virtually identical to the Type 8
   algorithm; see the discussion of SPK Type 8 for details. However, the
   Type 9 algorithm executes more slowly than the Type 8 algorithm, since
   the Type 9 reader must search through tables of time tags to find
   appropriates states to interpolate, while the Type 8 reader can locate
   the correct set of states to interpolate by a direct computation.

<h3> Type 10: Space Command Two-Line Elements
</h3><p><br><br>
   The SPK data Type 10 uses the SPICE concept of a generic segment to
   store a collection of packets each of which models the trajectory of
   some Earth satellite using Space Command two-line element sets (TLEs)
   (formerly the North American Air Defense --- NORAD). TLE propagation
   occurs using the algorithms as described in the Spacetrak 3 report for
   SGP4 and SDP4. Note: The Spacetrak 3 implementation of SDP4 contained
   several programming errors. The errors were corrected for CSPICE
   implementation.
</p><p>
 
   The SPICE generic segment software handles storage, arrangement, and
   retrieval of the TLEs. We review only the pertinent points about generic
   segments here.
</p><p>
 
   A generic SPK segment contains several logical data partitions:
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> A partition for constant values to be associated with each data packet in
the segment.

<h3> Type 12: Hermite Interpolation --- Equal Time Steps
</h3><p><br><br>
   The twelfth SPK data type represents a continuous ephemeris using a
   discrete set of states and a sliding window Hermite interpolation
   method. The epochs, also called "time tags," associated with the states
   must be evenly spaced: there must be some positive constant STEP such
   that each time tag differs from its predecessor by STEP seconds. For any
   request epoch, the data type defines a state by interpolating a set of
   consecutive states, or "window," centered as closely as possible to the
   request epoch. Interpolated position values are obtained for each
   coordinate by fitting a Hermite polynomial to the window's set of
   position and velocity values for that coordinate; interpolated velocity
   is obtained by differentiating the interpolating polynomials. Details of
   the interpolation method are given below.
</p><p>
 
   The SPK system can also represent an ephemeris using unequally spaced
   discrete states and Hermite interpolation; SPK type 13 does this. SPK
   type 13 sacrifices some run-time speed and economy of storage in order
   to achieve greater flexibility.
</p><p>
 
   The states in a type 12 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The six components of each state vector
   represent the position and velocity (x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, in
   kilometers and kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris
   applies, relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor.
   The epochs corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times
   (TDB), expressed as seconds past J2000.
</p><p>
 
   Each segment also has a polynomial degree associated with it; this is
   the degree of the interpolating polynomials to be used in evaluating
   states based on the data in the segment. The identical degree is used
   for interpolation of each state component.
</p><p>
 
   Type 12 SPK segments have the structure shown below:

   In the diagram, each box representing a state vector corresponds to six
   double precision numbers; the other boxes represent individual double
   precision numbers. Since the epochs of the states are evenly spaced,
   they are represented by a start epoch and a step size. The number of
   states must be greater than or equal to the window size, which is
   related to the polynomial degree as shown:
<p>
 
</p><pre>   DEGREE  =  2 * WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
</pre>
   The type 12 interpolation method works as follows: given an epoch at
   which a state is requested and a segment having coverage for that epoch,
   the type 12 reader finds a window of states whose epochs are "centered"
   about the epoch. If the window size S is even, then the window will
   consist of S consecutive states such that the request time is between
   the epochs of the members of the group having indices, relative to the
   start of the group, of S/2 and (S/2 + 1), inclusive. When S is odd, the
   group will contain a central state whose epoch is closest to the request
   time, and will also contain (S-1)/2 neighboring states on either side of
   the central one. For each of the x-, y-, and z-coordinates, the type 12
   evaluator will fit an Hermite polynomial to the corresponding position
   and velocity values of the states in the selected window. Each
   polynomial is evaluated at the request time to yield the interpolated
   position components. The derivatives of these polynomials are evaluated
   at the request time to yield the interpolated velocity components.
<p>
 
   For the jth coordinate, the interpolation algorithm is mathematically
   equivalent to finding the unique polynomial of degree 2*S-1 that
   interpolates the ordered pairs
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   ( epoch(i), position(j,i) ),  i = k ,  k , ... , k
                                      1    2         S
</pre>
   and whose derivative interpolates the ordered pairs
<p>
 
</p><pre>   ( epoch(i), velocity(j,i) ),  i = k ,  k , ... , k
                                      1    2         S
</pre>
   and evaluating the polynomial and its derivative at the requested epoch.
   Here
<p>
 
</p><pre>    k ,  k , ... , k
     1    2         S
</pre>
   are the indices of the states in the interpolation window,
<p>
 
</p><pre>   epoch(i)
</pre>
   is the epoch of the ith state and
<p>
 
</p><pre>   position(j,i)
   velocity(j,i)
</pre>
   are, respectively, the jth components of the position and velocity
   comprising the ith state.
<p>
 
   There is an exception to the state selection algorithm described above:
   the request time may be too near the first or last state of the segment
   to be properly bracketed. In this case, the set of states selected for
   interpolation still has size S, and includes either the first or last
   state of the segment.

   To facilitate the creation of type 12 segments, a segment writing
   routine called <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkw12_c.html">spkw12_c</a> has been provided. This routine takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a
   complete description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.

<a name="Type 13: Hermite Interpolation --- Unequal Time Steps"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Type 13: Hermite Interpolation --- Unequal Time Steps
</h3><p><br><br>
   The thirteenth SPK data type represents a continuous ephemeris using a
   discrete set of states and a sliding window Hermite interpolation
   method. The epochs, also called "time tags," associated with the states
   need not be evenly spaced. For any request epoch, the data type defines
   a state by interpolating a set of consecutive states, or "window,"
   centered as closely as possible to the request epoch. Interpolated
   position values are obtained for each coordinate by fitting a Hermite
   polynomial to the window's set of position and velocity values for that
   coordinate; interpolated velocity is obtained by differentiating the
   interpolating polynomials. Details of the interpolation method are given
   below.
</p><p>
 
   The states in a type 13 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The six components of each state vector
   represent the position and velocity (x, y, z, dx/dt, dy/dt, dz/dt, in
   kilometers and kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris
   applies, relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor.
   The epochs corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times
   (TDB), expressed as seconds past J2000.
</p><p>
 
   Each segment also has a polynomial degree associated with it; this is
   the degree of the interpolating polynomials to be used in evaluating
   states based on the data in the segment. The identical degree is used
   for interpolation of each state component.
</p><p>
 
   Type 13 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>                                       +--------+
                                       |  x(1)  |
                                   /   +--------+

                                 /     +--------+
                                /      |  z(1)  |
   +-----------------------+   /       +--------+
   | State 1               |  &lt;        |dx(1)/dt|
   +-----------------------+   \       +--------+
   | State 2               |    \      |dy(1)/dt|

               .                  \    |dz(1)/dt|
               .                       +--------+
               .
   +-----------------------+
   | State N               |
   +-----------------------+
   | Epoch 1               |
   +-----------------------+
   | Epoch 2               |
   +-----------------------+
               .
               .
               .
   +-----------------------+
   | Epoch N               |
   +-----------------------+
   | Epoch 100             | (First directory)
   +-----------------------+
               .
               .
               .
   +-----------------------+
   | Epoch ((N-1)/100)*100 | (Last directory)
   +-----------------------+
   | Window size - 1       |
   +-----------------------+
   | Number of states      |
   +-----------------------+
 
</pre>
   In the diagram, each box representing a state vector corresponds to six
   double precision numbers; the other boxes represent individual double
   precision numbers. The number of states must be greater than or equal to
   the window size, which is related to the polynomial degree as shown:
<p>
 
</p><pre>   DEGREE  =  2 * WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
</pre>
   The set of time tags is augmented by a series of directory entries;
   these entries allow the type 13 reader to search for states more
   efficiently. The directory entries contain time tags whose indices are
   multiples of 100. The set of indices of time tags stored in the
   directories ranges from 100 to
<p>
 
</p><pre>   (  (N-1) / 100  ) * 100
</pre>
   where N is the total number of time tags. Note that if N is
<p>
 
</p><pre>   Q * 100
</pre>
   then only
<p>
 
</p><pre>   Q - 1
</pre>
   directory entries are stored, and in particular, if there are only 100
   states in the segment, there are no directories.
<p>
 
   The type 13 interpolation algorithm is virtually identical to the type
   12 algorithm; see the discussion of SPK type 12 for details. However,
   the type 13 algorithm executes more slowly than the type 12 algorithm,
   since the type 13 reader must search through tables of time tags to find
   appropriates states to interpolate, while the type 12 reader can locate
   the correct set of states to interpolate by a direct computation.
</p><p>
 
   To facilitate the creation of type 13 segments, a segment writing
   routine called <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkw13_c.html">spkw13_c</a> has been provided. This routine takes as input

</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Type 14: Chebyshev Polynomials --- Unequal Time Steps
</h3><p><br><br>
   The SPK data Type 14 uses the SPICE concept of a generic segment to
   store a collection of packets each of which models the trajectory of
   some object with respect to another over some interval of time. Each
   packet contains a set of coefficients for Chebyshev polynomials that
   approximate the position and velocity of some object. The time intervals
   corresponding to each packet are non-overlapping. Moreover their union
   covers the interval of time spanned by the start and end times of the
   Type 14 segment. Unlike Types 2 and 3 the time spacing between sets of
   coefficients for a Type 14 segment may be non-uniform.
</p><p>
 
   The storage, arrangement and retrieval of packets is handled by the
   SPICE generic segment software. That software is documented in the
   document genseg.req. (The document genseg.req is currently in
   preparation.) We only review the pertinent points about generic segments
   here.
</p><p>
 
   A generic SPK segment contains several logical data partitions:
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> A partition for constant values to be associated with each data packet in
the segment.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> A partition for the data packets.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>3.</tt> A partition for epochs.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>4.</tt> A partition for a packet directory, if the segment contains variable sized
packets.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>5.</tt> A partition for an epoch directory.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>6.</tt> A reserved partition that is not currently used. This partition is only for
the use of the NAIF group at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>7.</tt> A partition for the meta data which describes the locations and sizes of
other partitions as well as providing some additional descriptive
information about the generic segment.

      +----------------------------+
</pre>
   Only the placement of the meta data at the end of a generic segment is
   required. The other data partitions may occur in any order in the
   generic segment because the meta data will contain pointers to their
   appropriate locations within the generic segment.
<p>
 
   In the case of Type 14 SPK segments each ``packet'' contains an epoch,
   EPOCH, an allowed time offset, OFFSET, from the epoch, and 6 sets of
   Chebyshev polynomial coefficients which are used to evaluate the x,y,z,
   dx/dt, dy/dt, and dz/dt components of the state for epochs within OFFSET
   seconds of the EPOCH. Each packet is organized with the following
   structure:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   ------------------------------------------------
   |  The midpoint of the approximation interval  |
   ------------------------------------------------
   |  The radius of the approximation interval    |
   ------------------------------------------------
   |  CHBDEG+1 coefficients for the X coordinate  |
   ------------------------------------------------
   |  CHBDEG+1 coefficients for the Y coordinate  |
   ------------------------------------------------
   |  CHBDEG+1 coefficients for the Z coordinate  |
   ------------------------------------------------
   |  CHBDEG+1 coefficients for the X velocity    |
   ------------------------------------------------
   |  CHBDEG+1 coefficients for the Y velocity    |
   ------------------------------------------------
   |  CHBDEG+1 coefficients for the Z velocity    |
   ------------------------------------------------
</pre>
   The maximum degree Chebyshev representation that can currently be
   accommodated is 18. Packets are stored in increasing order of the
   midpoint of the approximation interval.
<p>
 
   The ``constants'' partition contains a single value, the degree of the
   Chebyshev representation.
</p><p>
 
   The reference epochs partition contains an ordered collection of epochs.
   The i'th reference epoch corresponds to the beginning of the interval
   for which the i'th packet can be used to determine the state of the
   object modeled by this segment.
</p><p>
 
   The ``epoch directory'' contains every 100th reference epoch. The epoch
   directory is used to efficiently locate an the reference epoch that
   should be associated with an epoch for which a state has been requested.
</p><p>
 
   The ``packet directory'' is empty.
</p><p>
 
   As noted above the exact location of the various partitions must be
   obtained from the Meta data contained at the end of the segment.
</p><p>
 
   Access to the data should be made via the CSPICE generic segment
   functions.
</p><p>
 
   Type 14 segments should be created using the functions <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spk14b_c.html">spk14b_c</a>,

<a name="Type 18: ESOC/DDID Hermite/Lagrange Interpolation"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Type 18: ESOC/DDID Hermite/Lagrange Interpolation
</h3><p><br><br>
   SPK type 18 has been provided to support accurate duplication within the
   SPK system of spacecraft ephemerides used by the European Space Agency
   (ESA) on the Mars Express, Rosetta, SMART-1 and Venus Express missions.
   However, the algorithms used by SPK type 18 are very general; type 18's
   applicability is by no means limited to these missions.
</p><p>
 
   Because of the possibility of evolution of the mathematical
   representations of ephemerides used by ESA, SPK type 18 is designed to
   accommodate multiple representations, thereby avoiding a proliferation
   of SPK data types. SPK type 18 refers to each supported mathematical
   representation of ephemeris data as a ``subtype.''
</p><p>
 
   Currently SPK type 18 supports two subtypes:
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> Subtype 0
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> Separate sliding-window Hermite interpolation of position and velocity. The
ephemeris is represented by a series of 12-element ``packets'' and
associated time tags. The time tags may be unequally spaced. Each packet
contains three Cartesian position components, three velocity components
meant to be used for Hermite interpolation of the position, three velocity
components (not necessarily equal to the previous three), and three
acceleration components meant to be used with the second set of velocity
components for Hermite interpolation of the velocity. The position and
velocity resulting from this interpolation method are in principle
independent. The same interpolation degree is used for each position and
velocity component.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> Subtype 1
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> Separate sliding-window Lagrange interpolation of position and velocity.
The ephemeris is represented by a series of 6-element ``packets'' and
associated time tags. The time tags may be unequally spaced. Each packet
contains three Cartesian position components and three velocity components.
The position components and velocity components are interpolated
separately. The position and velocity resulting from this interpolation
method are in principle independent. The same interpolation degree is used
for each position and velocity component.
<br><br></ul>
   The sliding-window interpolation technique used by this data type works
   as follows: for any request epoch, the data type defines a component of
   position or velocity by interpolating a set of values of that component
   defined on a set of consecutive time tags---a "window"---centered as
   closely as possible to the request epoch. The nominal window size is
   dictated by the degree and type (Hermite vs. Lagrange) of the
   interpolating polynomials. Normally the window of time tags has even
   size, and the window is selected so that the request time is located
   between the two central time tags in the window.
<p>
 
   When the request time is near a segment boundary, the window is
   truncated if necessary on the side closest to the boundary. If a segment
   contains too few packets to form a window of nominal size, as many
   packets as are needed and available are used to construct the window. In
   this case the window size may be odd. In any case the window never
   includes more than WNDSIZ/2 time tags on either side of the request
   time, where WNDSIZ is the nominal window size.
</p><p>
 
   The states in a type 18 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The position and velocity components of
   each packet represent the position (x, y, z, in kilometers and
   kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris applies,
   relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor. The epochs
   corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times (TDB),
   expressed as seconds past J2000.
</p><p>
 
   Type 18 SPK segments have the structure shown below:

   In the diagram, each box representing a packet corresponds to either
   twelve or six double precision numbers; the other boxes represent
   individual double precision numbers. The number of states normally
   should be greater than or equal to the window size, which is related to
   the polynomial degree as shown:
<p>
 
</p><pre>   Subtype 0:     DEGREE  =  2 * WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
   Subtype 1:     DEGREE  =      WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
</pre>
   The set of time tags is augmented by a series of directory entries;
   these entries allow the type 18 reader to search for states more
   efficiently. The directory entries contain time tags whose indices are
   multiples of 100. The set of indices of time tags stored in the
   directories ranges from 100 to
<p>
 
</p><pre>   (  (N-1) / 100  ) * 100
</pre>
   where N is the total number of time tags. Note that if N is
<p>
 
</p><pre>   Q * 100
</pre>
   then only
<p>
 
</p><pre>   Q - 1
</pre>
   directory entries are stored, and in particular, if there are only 100
   states in the segment, there are no directories.
<p>
 
   To facilitate the creation of type 18 segments, a segment writing
   routine called <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkw18_c.html">spkw18_c</a> has been provided. This routine takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a
   complete description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.

<a name="Type 19: ESOC/DDID Piecewise Interpolation"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Type 19: ESOC/DDID Piecewise Interpolation
</h3><p><br><br>
   As with SPK type 18, SPK type 19 has been provided to support accurate
   duplication by the SPK system of spacecraft ephemerides used by the
   European Space Agency (ESA) on the Mars Express, Rosetta, SMART-1 and
   Venus Express missions.
</p><p>
 
   SPK type 19 is an enhanced version of SPK type 18. Type 19 enables
   creation of SPK files representing the same ephemerides that can be
   represented using type 18, but containing far fewer segments. Data from
   multiple type 18 segments can be stored in a single type 19 segment, as
   long as those segments satisfy certain restrictions:
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>--</tt> The segments are for the same body, center, and reference frame.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>--</tt> The segments' coverage intervals, when arranged in increasing time order,
overlap only at their endpoints, and have no intervening gaps.
<br><br></ul>
   Within a type 19 segment, each set of data corresponding to a type 18
   segment is called a ``mini-segment.'' A type 19 segment contains one or
   more mini-segments.
<p>
 
   Each mini-segment contains a time ordered, strictly increasing sequence
   of epochs (no two epochs of the same mini-segment may coincide) and an
   associated sequence of ephemeris data sets called ``packets.'' The
   composition of a packet depends on the subtype of the mini-segment to
   which the packet belongs; subtypes are discussed in more detail below.
</p><p>
 
   The time coverage of a mini-segment is called an ``interpolation
   interval.'' The endpoints (boundaries) of each interpolation interval
   must be contained in the time interval bounded by the first and last
   members of the epoch sequence of the corresponding mini-segment. If the
   Ith mini-segment's epoch sequence is
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   E_I1, ..., E_IM
</pre>
   and the mini-segment's interpolation interval bounds are
<p>
 
</p><pre>   IV_IB, IV_IE
</pre>
   then it is required that
<p>
 
</p><pre>   E_I1 &lt; IV_IB &lt; IV_IE &lt; E_IM
        -              -
</pre>
   Mini-segments are allowed to contain ``padding'' epochs and packets
   beyond both ends of their interpolation intervals. Padding epochs on the
   left of an interpolation interval are less than the interval start time;
   padding epochs on the right exceed the interval stop time. Padding
   enables control of interpolation behavior at and near interpolation
   interval boundaries. Padding does not contribute to a type 19 segment's
   time coverage. The use of padding is discussed in greater detail below.
<p>
 
   The interpolation intervals of a type 19 segment have no intervening
   gaps and overlap only at single points. The end time of each
   interpolation interval is the start time of the next. The start time of
   a type 19 segment is greater than or equal to the start time of the
   first interval, and the segment's end time is less than or equal to the
   stop time of the last interval.
</p><p>
 
   Interpolation intervals must have strictly positive length.
</p><p>
 
   When type 19 data are interpolated to produce a state vector for a given
   request time, only data from a single mini-segment whose interpolation
   interval contains the request time are used.
</p><p>
 
   When a request time coincides with the boundary between two
   interpolation intervals, there is a choice as to which interval will
   provide ephemeris data. The creator of a type 19 segment can control
   this behavior via a parameter passed to the type 19 segment writer
   spkw19_c. For a given type 19 segment, depending on the value of this
   parameter, either the earlier interval is always selected, or the later
   interval is always selected.
</p><p>
 
   Because of the possibility of evolution of the mathematical
   representations of ephemerides used by ESA, SPK type 19 is designed to
   accommodate multiple representations of state data, thereby avoiding a
   proliferation of SPK data types. SPK type 19 refers to each supported
   mathematical representation of ephemeris data as a ``subtype.''
</p><p>
 
   Currently SPK type 19 supports two subtypes:
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> Subtype 0
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> Separate sliding-window Hermite interpolation of position and velocity. The
ephemeris is represented by a series of 12-element ``packets'' and
associated time tags. The time tags may be unequally spaced. Each packet
contains three Cartesian position components, three velocity components
meant to be used for Hermite interpolation of the position, three velocity
components (not necessarily equal to the previous three), and three
acceleration components meant to be used with the second set of velocity
components for Hermite interpolation of the velocity. The position and
velocity resulting from this interpolation method are in principle
independent. The same interpolation degree is used for each position and
velocity component.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> The interpolation degree of a subtype 0 mini-segment must be equivalent to
3 mod 4, that is, it must be in the set
<br><br></ul>
<pre>            { 3, 7, 11, ..., MAXDEG }
</pre>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> where MAXDEG is the maximum supported degree.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> Subtype 1
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> Separate sliding-window Lagrange interpolation of position and velocity.
The ephemeris is represented by a series of 6-element ``packets'' and
associated time tags. The time tags may be unequally spaced. Each packet
contains three Cartesian position components and three velocity components.
The position components and velocity components are interpolated
separately. The position and velocity resulting from this interpolation
method are in principle independent. The same interpolation degree is used
for each position and velocity component.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>  </tt> The interpolation degree of a subtype 0 mini-segment must be odd and must
be in the range 1:MAXDEG, where MAXDEG is the maximum supported degree.
<br><br></ul>
   The sliding-window interpolation technique used by this data type works
   as follows: for any request epoch, the data type's state evaluation code
   computes a component of position or velocity by interpolating a set of
   values of that component defined on a set of consecutive time tags---a
   "window"---centered as closely as possible to the request epoch. The
   nominal window size is dictated by the degree and type (Hermite vs.
   Lagrange) of the interpolating polynomials. Normally the window of time
   tags has even size, and the window is selected so that the request time
   is located between the two central time tags in the window. When the
   request time is too close to an endpoint of the mini-segment's epoch
   sequence to permit construction of a window of nominal size, the window
   is truncated at that endpoint.
<p>
 
   Although type 19 interpolation intervals support padding, padding is not
   required. Below we'll discuss the role of padding, but the reader should
   keep in mind that the size of the pads at either end of an interpolation
   interval could be zero.
</p><p>
 
   In SPK type 19, interpolation interval padding boundaries (the start
   time of the padding preceding the interval's coverage and the stop time
   of the padding following the coverage) affect interpolation in the same
   way that segment boundaries affect type 18 interpolation. When the
   request time is near a padding boundary, the window is truncated if
   necessary on the side closest to the boundary. If an interpolation
   interval, including padding, contains too few packets to form a window
   of nominal size, as many packets as are needed and available are used to
   construct the window. In this case the window size may be odd. In any
   case the window never includes more than WNDSIZ/2 time tags on either
   side of the request time, where WNDSIZ is the nominal window size.
</p><p>
 
   The mini-segments of a type 19 segment need not use the same subtypes
   and interpolation degrees.
</p><p>
 
   The states in a type 19 segment are geometric: they do not take into
   account aberration corrections. The position and velocity components of
   each packet represent the position (x, y, z, in kilometers and
   kilometers per second) of the body to which the ephemeris applies,
   relative to the center specified by the segment's descriptor. The epochs
   corresponding to the states are barycentric dynamical times (TDB),
   expressed as seconds past J2000.
</p><p>
 
   Type 19 SPK segments have the structure shown below:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   +--------------------------------+
   | Interval 1 mini-segment        |
   +--------------------------------+
                   .
                   .
                   .

   +--------------------------------+
   | Mini-segment 1 start pointer   |
   +--------------------------------+
                   .
                   .
                   .
   +--------------------------------+
   | Mini-segment N start pointer   |
   +--------------------------------+
   | Mini-segment N stop pointer    |
   +--------------------------------+
   | Boundary choice flag           |
   +--------------------------------+
   | Number of intervals            |
   +--------------------------------+
</pre>
   Below we first describe the overall segment structure, then we cover the
   mini-segment structure.
<p>
 
   The array of interval boundaries contains the start time of each
   interval, plus the stop time of the final interval.
</p><p>
 
   The list of interpolation interval boundary times has its own directory,
   which has the same structure as the time tag directories of type 18
   segments. Let the interval count be N. As with time tag directories, the
   start time directory contains boundary times whose indices are multiples
   of 100, except that if N+1 is a multiple of 100, the last boundary time
   is not included.
</p><p>
 
   The array of mini-segment pointers contains a pointer to the start of
   each mini-segment, plus a final ``stop'' pointer for the final
   mini-segment. The stop pointer points to the location immediately
   following the last address of the final mini-segment.
</p><p>
 
   The mini-segment pointers are 1-based indices relative to the start
   address of the segment. For example, a pointer value of 1 indicates the
   first address of the segment.
</p><p>
 
   Following the mini-segment pointers is the interval selection flag. When
   this flag has the value 1.D0, the later interpolation interval is used
   when a request time falls on the common boundary between two
   interpolation intervals. If the selection flag is 0, the earlier
   interval is used.
</p><p>
 
   Each mini-segment has the structure of a type 18 SPK segment. The
   structure is shown below:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   +-----------------------+
   | Packet 1              |
   +-----------------------+
               .
               .
               .
   +-----------------------+
   | Packet M              |
   +-----------------------+
   | Epoch 1               |
   +-----------------------+
               .
               .
               .
   +-----------------------+
   | Epoch M               |
   +-----------------------+
   | Epoch 100             | (First time tag directory)
   +-----------------------+
               .
               .
               .
   +-----------------------+
   | Epoch ((M-1)/100)*100 | (Last time tag directory)
   +-----------------------+
   | Subtype code          |
   +-----------------------+
   | Window size           |
   +-----------------------+
   | Number of packets     |
   +-----------------------+
 
</pre>
   In the mini-segment diagram, each box representing a packet corresponds
   to either twelve or six double precision numbers; the other boxes
   represent individual double precision numbers. The number of packets
   normally should be greater than or equal to the window size, which is
   related to the polynomial degree as shown:
<p>
 
</p><pre>   Subtype 0:     DEGREE  =  2 * WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
   Subtype 1:     DEGREE  =      WINDOW_SIZE  -  1
</pre>
   The mini-segment's set of time tags is augmented by a series of
   directory entries; these entries allow the type 19 reader to search for
   packets more efficiently. The directory entries contain time tags whose
   indices are multiples of 100. The set of indices of time tags stored in
   the directories ranges from 100 to
<p>
 
</p><pre>   (  (M-1) / 100  ) * 100
</pre>
   where M is the total number of time tags. Note that if M is
<p>
 
</p><pre>   Q * 100
</pre>
   then only
<p>
 
</p><pre>   Q - 1
</pre>
   directory entries are stored, and in particular, if there are only 100
   states in the segment, there are no directories.
<p>
 
   Following the time tag directory are three parameters associated with
   the mini-segment: the subtype, the interpolation window size, and the
   packet count.
</p><p>
 
   To facilitate the creation of type 19 segments, a segment writing
   routine called spkw19_c has been provided. This routine takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the subroutine provides a
   complete description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.

<a name="Type 20: Chebyshev (velocity only)"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Type 20: Chebyshev (velocity only)
</h3><p><br><br>
   SPK data type 20 contains Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for the
   velocity of a body, relative to its center of motion, as a function of
   time. The position of the body is obtained by integrating the velocity
   using a specified integration constant.
</p><p>
 
   This data type is provided to accurately represent ``EPM'' ephemerides
   developed by the Institute of Applied Astronomy (IAA), Russian Academy
   of Sciences (RAS).
</p><p>
 
   Each type 20 segment contains an arbitrary number of logical records.
   Each record contains a set of Chebyshev coefficients valid throughout an
   interval of fixed length. Each record also contains a position vector
   applicable at the midpoint of its coverage interval.
</p><p>
 
   The records within a segment are ordered by increasing initial epoch.
   All records contain the same number of coefficients. A segment of this
   type is structured as
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   +---------------+
   | Record 1      |
   +---------------+
   | Record 2      |
   +---------------+

   | RSIZE         |
   +---------------+
   | N             |
   +---------------+
</pre>
   A set of seven parameters at the end of the segment provides the
   information needed to determine the location of the record corresponding
   to a particular epoch and to determine the units associated with the
   data:
<p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> DSCALE is the distance scale used for both position and velocity; DSCALE
has units of km. For example, if the distance units are AU, then DSCALE is
the value of the AU in km.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> TSCALE is the time scale used for velocity; TSCALE has units of TDB
seconds. For example, if the time units of the velocity data are TDB Julian
days, then TSCALE is 86400.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>3.</tt> INITJD is the integer part of the TDB Julian date of the initial epoch of
the first record. INITJD has units of Julian days. INITJD may be less than,
equal to, or greater than the initial epoch.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>4.</tt> INITFR is the fractional part of the TDB Julian date of the initial epoch
of the first record. INITFR has units of Julian days. INITFR has magnitude
strictly less than 1 day. The sum INITJD + INITFR equals the TDB Julian
date of the initial epoch of the first record.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>5.</tt> INTLEN is the length of the interval covered by each record, in TDB Julian
days.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>6.</tt> RSIZE is the total size of (number of array elements in) each record. The
same number of coefficients is always used for each component, and all
records are the same size. RSIZE is 3 + 3*(DEGP+1), where DEGP is the
common degree of the Chebyshev expansions for each velocity component.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>7.</tt> N is the number of records contained in the segment.
<br><br></ul>
   Each record is structured as follows:
<p>
 
</p><pre>   +------------------+
   | X  data          |
   +------------------+
   | Y  data          |
   +------------------+
   | Z  data          |
   +------------------+
</pre>
   where each data section for coordinate I contains
<p>
 
</p><pre>   +-------------------------------------------------+
   | Chebyshev coefficients for velocity component I |
   +-------------------------------------------------+
   | Position component I at interval midpoint       |
   +-------------------------------------------------+
</pre>
   The velocity coefficients have units of DSCALE km/TSCALE seconds:
   multiplying a Chebyshev expansion's value by DSCALE/TSCALE converts
   velocity to units of km/s.
<p>
 
   The position at a record's midpoint epoch is given in units of DSCALE
   km: multiplying the position by DSCALE converts the position to units of
   km.
</p><p>
 
   Type 20 data are used to compute states as follows: for a given time T
   seconds past J2000 TDB, let MID and RADIUS be the midpoint and radius,
   expressed as seconds past J2000 TDB, of the record coverage interval
   that contains T: the coverage interval is the time span
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   MID - RADIUS : MID + RADIUS
</pre>
   The velocity at T of the body relative to its center of motion is given
   by the value of the corresponding record's Chebyshev expansions at S,
   where
<p>
 
</p><pre>   S = (T - MID) / RADIUS
</pre>
   The position of the body relative to its center of motion at T is given
   by
<p>
 
</p><pre>                                         S
   (Position at MID) +  RADIUS*( Integral ( Velocity ) )
                                         0
</pre>
   The function spke20_ contains the algorithm used to construct a state
   from a particular logical record.
<p>
 
   To facilitate the creation of Type 20 segments, a segment writing
   function called <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkw20_c.html">spkw20_c</a> has been provided. This function takes as input
   arguments the handle of an SPK file that is open for writing, the
   information needed to construct the segment descriptor, and the data to
   be stored in the segment. The header of the function provides a complete
   description of the input arguments and an example of its usage.

<a name="Type 21: Extended Modified Difference Arrays"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Type 21: Extended Modified Difference Arrays
</h3><p><br><br>
   SPK data type 21 contains extended Modified Difference Arrays (MDA),
   also called ``difference lines.'' These data structures use the same
   mathematical trajectory representation as SPK data type 1, but type 21
   allows use of larger, higher-degree MDAs.
</p><p>
 
   This data type is normally used for spacecraft whose ephemerides are
   produced by JPL's principal trajectory integrator---DPTRAJ. Difference
   lines are extracted from spacecraft trajectory files (``P-files'' and
   ``PV-files'') created by DPTRAJ.
</p><p>
 
   Each segment containing Modified Difference Arrays contains an arbitrary
   number of logical records. Each record contains difference line
   coefficients applicable over a time interval containing a reference
   epoch, along with the state at that epoch. The time intervals of
   adjacent records overlap at their common endpoints.
</p><p>
 
   The contents of the records themselves are described in [163]. The
   function spke21_ contains the algorithm used to construct a state from a
   particular record and epoch.
</p><p>
 
   The records within a segment are ordered by increasing final epoch. The
   final epochs associated with the records must be distinct.
</p><p>
 
   A segment of this type is structured as follows:
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   +-----------------------------------------+
   | Record 1 (difference line coefficients) |
   +-----------------------------------------+
   | Record 2 (difference line coefficients) |

   | Record N (difference line coefficients) |

   The number of records in a segment, N, can be arbitrarily large.
<p>
 
   Records 1 through N contain the difference line coefficients and other
   constants needed to compute state data. Each one of these records
   contains DLSIZE double precision numbers, where DLSIZE is in the range
</p><p>
 
</p><pre>   71 : (4*MAXTRM) + 1
</pre>
   inclusive. MAXTRM is declared in the SPICELIB include file spk21.inc.
<p>
 
   A list of the final epochs of the records is stored immediately after
   the last record.
</p><p>
 
   Following the list of epochs is a second list, the ``directory,''
   containing every 100th epoch from the previous list. If there are N
   epochs, there will be N/100 directory epochs. If there are fewer than
   100 epochs, then the segment will not contain any directory epochs.
   Directory epochs are used to speed up access to desired records.
</p><p>
 
   The penultimate element of the segment is the difference line size. The
   final element in the segment is the number of records contained in the
   segment, N.
</p><p>
 
   The index of the record providing ephemeris data for a user-specified
   epoch is the index of the first epoch in the segment's epoch list not
   less than the specified epoch.

<h2> Summary of Mnemonics
</h2><hr align="LEFT" width="50%"><p><br><br>
   CSPICE contains a family of functions that are designed specifically for
   use with SPK files. The name of each function begins with the letters
   ``spk'', followed by a two- or three-character mnemonic. For example,
   the function that returns the state of one body with respect to another
   is named <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/cspice/spkez_c.html">spkez_c</a>, pronounced `S-P-K-E-Z'.
</p><p>
 
   Many of the lower-level CSPICE functions have SPICELIB counterparts
   implemented in Fortran as entry points of another function.
</p><p>
 
   The following is a complete list of mnemonics and translations, in
   alphabetical order.

<h1> Appendix B --- A Template for SPK Comments
</h1><hr noshade="noshade" size="3"><p><br><br><br>
   An undocumented ephemeris is in many respects worse than undocumented
   source code. With source code you can at least read the code and perhaps
   discern the function of the source code. An ephemeris on the other hand
   is a binary file. All it contains are numbers. It's very difficult to
   determine the purpose of an ephemeris simply from the state information
   it contains. For this reason, any ephemeris created for use by anyone
   other than yourself needs documentation.
</p><p>
 
   If you create SPK files NAIF strongly recommends that you include
   descriptive documentation in the comments portion of the SPK file. You
   can use the utility program COMMNT to insert comments into the file, or
   you may use the functions in the SPC family to insert the comments when
   you create the SPK file. (See <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/ug/commnt.html">commnt.ug</a> or <a href="http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/toolkit_docs/C/req/spc.html">spc.req</a> for further details.)
</p><p>
 
   This appendix addresses the contents of your comments. What will others
   (or yourself) want to know about the SPK file weeks, months or years
   after it has been created? Providing this information can be a
   challenge. It's difficult to know in advance all the questions someone
   might ask about an ephemeris you've created. To assist with this task
   NAIF has devised a ``template'' that you may wish to use as a starting
   point when creating the comments for an SPK file.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Constraints"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h2> Constraints
</h2><hr align="LEFT" width="50%"><p><br><br>
   The comments you place in an SPK file must be plain ASCII text. Each
   line of text must consist of 80 or fewer characters. The text must
   contain only printing characters (ASCII characters 32 through 126).
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="The Basic Template"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h2> The Basic Template
</h2><hr align="LEFT" width="50%"><p><br><br>
   Here's one way to create the comments for an SPK file.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Objects in the Ephemeris"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Objects in the Ephemeris
</h3><p><br><br>
   List the names and NAIF ID codes for the objects in the file.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Approximate Time Coverage"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Approximate Time Coverage
</h3><p><br><br>
   Provide a summary of the time for which states are available for the
   objects in the file. If you use UTC times in this summary and the
   ephemeris extends more than 6 months into the future, you should
   probably state that the times are approximate. You don't know when
   leapseconds will occur more than a few months in advance, so you can't
   know the exact UTC time boundaries for the ephemeris if it extends years
   into the future.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Status"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Status
</h3><p><br><br>
   Provide the ``status'' of the ephemeris. Tell the user why this
   ephemeris was created and for whom it is intended. For example, if this
   is the second in a series of ephemerides that will be produced for some
   object tell which ephemeris this one supersedes. Tell the user when the
   next ephemeris in the series will be available. Is the ephemeris
   suitable only for preliminary studies? Is it good for all Earth based
   observations? Is this an official operational product? Are there
   situations for which the ephemeris is not suitable?
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Pedigree"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Pedigree
</h3><p><br><br>
   Provide a production summary for the ephemeris. Tell when the ephemeris
   was produced (the system time stamp may not port if the file is copied
   to other systems). Say who produced the ephemeris; what source products
   were used in the production; what version of the producing program was
   used in the creation of the ephemeris. If the ephemeris is based on a
   set of recent observations, say so. In short give the user the pedigree
   of this ephemeris. This information is mostly for your benefit. If a
   problem arises with the ephemeris, you will know how the problem was
   created and have a better chance of fixing the problem.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Usage"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Usage
</h3><p><br><br>
   Provide information the user will need to effectively use the ephemeris.
   Tell the user what other SPICE kernels are needed to use this ephemeris.
   For example, if the ephemeris contains only the state of an asteroid
   relative to the sun, the user will probably need a planetary ephemeris
   to effectively use the one you've created. Recommend a planetary
   ephemeris to use with your SPK file. If the ephemeris contains states of
   objects relative to non-inertial frames, the user will probably need
   other kernels so that various state transformations can be performed.
   Recommend which of these kernels the user should use with your SPK file.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Accuracy"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Accuracy
</h3><p><br><br>
   If possible give some estimate as to the accuracy of your SPK file. Use
   numbers. Words such as ``this is the best available'' do not convey how
   much you know about the ephemeris.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Special Notes"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Special Notes
</h3><p><br><br>
   Provide a description of any special properties of this ephemeris. For
   example, if some observation seems to be in conflict with this ephemeris
   you should probably point this out.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="References0"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> References
</h3><p><br><br>
   List any references that may be relevant to the understanding of the
   ephemeris. For example, if the ephemeris is based upon observations
   contained in the literature, site the appropriate articles. If there is
   some technical memorandum or private communication that addresses
   certain aspects of this ephemeris list it. This will allow you to more
   easily answer questions about the ephemeris.
</p><p>
 
<br><br>
<a name="Contacts"></a>
</p><p align="right"><a href="#top"><small>Top</small></a></p>
<h3> Contacts
</h3><p><br><br>
   List your phone number, mail or e-mail address so that users of the
   ephemeris will be able to get in touch with you to ask questions or
   offer praise.

   This is the initial release of the CSPICE edition of the SPK "Required
   Reading" document. The underlying Fortran SPICE Toolkit version is
   N0050.
</p><p>
 
   The SPICE system has been extended to include CSPICE---a version of the
   SPICE Toolkit software coded in the ANSI C programming language.
</p><p>
 
   To better accommodate CSPICE users, NAIF translated the Fortran SPK
   Required Reading document into this "CSPICE edition." This document
   closely parallels the current Fortran edition but contains C versions of
   illustrations of source code, including listings of calling sequences
   and example programs.
</p><p>
 
   The CSPICE library---the C counterpart of SPICELIB---consists of two
   categories of functions:
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>--</tt> Low level functions, translated from Fortran to ANSI C via the automatic
translation program f2c.
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>--</tt> Application interface-level functions, hand-coded in ANSI C. These
hand-coded functions are called ``wrappers'' since they typically serve to

   In this first version of CSPICE, wrappers are provided for the principal
   SPK application interface functions. Hand-coded versions of other, less
   frequently used interface functions will be supplied in a later version
   of CSPICE. The remaining, lower-level functions will not be provided
   with wrappers.

   When the SPK system was introduced, states of objects (positions and
   velocities) were stored relative to inertial frames and retrieved
   relative to inertial frames. Beginning with version 41 of the SPICE
   Toolkit, states can be stored relative to both inertial and non-inertial
   frames. Moreover, states may be retrieved relative to both inertial and
   non-inertial frames. Non-inertial frames may be tied to the rotation of
   a planet, the orientation of some structure on a spacecraft, an Earth
   based telescope, etc. By expanding the SPK system in this way,
   computation that previously required dozens lines of code may now be
   reduced to three or four lines of code.
<p>
 
   This version of the ``SPK Required Reading'' documents for the first
   time this important expansion of the SPK system.
</p><p>
 
   Also in this version, we document:
</p><p>
 
</p><ul>
<tt>1.</tt> the ability to request states of objects by name instead of by object ID
codes;
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>2.</tt> the addition of SPK data Type 10 which allows the incorporation of NORAD
``two-line'' elements for Earth orbiters into the SPK system;
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>3.</tt> the addition of SPK data Type 14 which supports Chebyshev interpolation
over non-uniformly spaced time intervals;
<br><br></ul>
<ul>
<tt>4.</tt> the addition of SPK data Type 17 which supports the inclusion of
equinoctial elements into the SPK system.
