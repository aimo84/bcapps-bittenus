Creating this dir for backup-related work

Standard format for all file lists involving backups:

TODO: allow additional fields provided they use prefixes or something
TODO: preserving the inode number is probably useless and potentially bad?

1st field: size in bytes
2nd field: modify time in Unix seconds
3rd field: inode number (decimal, -1 if unknown)
4th field: raw mode (file type + user/group/other permissions)[1]
5th field: group id (decimal, -1 if unknown)
6th field: user id (decimal, -1 if unknown)
remainder: filename (not quoted, since it runs to end of line)

[1] see "man 2 stat" section "The following flags are defined for the
st_mode field" for details

(note that the option flags are different below, -c vs -f)

On cygwin/Unix: stat -c "%s %Y %i %f %g %u %n"
On MacOSX: stat -f "%z %m %i %p %g %u %N"
