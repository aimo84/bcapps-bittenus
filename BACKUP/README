Creating this dir for backup-related work

Standard format for all file lists involving backups:

TODO: allow additional fields provided they use prefixes or something
TODO: preserving the inode number is probably useless and potentially bad?

1st field: modify time in Unix seconds
2nd field: size in bytes
remainder: filename (not quoted, since it runs to end of line)

[1] see "man 2 stat" section "The following flags are defined for the
st_mode field" for details

(note that the option flags are different below, -c vs -f)

On cygwin/Unix: stat -c "%Y %s %i %f %g %u %n"
On MacOSX: stat -f "%m %z %i %p %g %u %N"
