Creating this dir for backup-related work

I'm trying to standardize on the following format for file lists (from
stat) for all backup programs:

first field: file size (this is important for sorting)

single quoted field: file type (eg, 'directory' or 'regular file')

stat %N style quoted field: file name (eg, `filename')

all other fields are currently ignored
