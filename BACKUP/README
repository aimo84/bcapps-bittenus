BACKUP FORMATS:

For storing file lists (to restore perms, etc):

1st field: modify time in Unix seconds
2nd field: size in bytes
3rd field: inode [may drop this later]
4th field: permissions in octal
5th field: file type (like "ls -l")
6th field: group name or id
7th field: username or id
8th field: device number
remainder: filename followed by newline

For GNU find (which is gfind on Mac), this is:

find [...] -printf "%T@ %s %i %m %y %g %u %D %p\n" 

Standard format for all file lists involving backups:

TODO: allow additional fields provided they use prefixes or something
TODO: preserving the inode number is probably useless and potentially bad?

1st field: modify time in Unix seconds
2nd field: size in bytes
remainder: filename (not quoted, since it runs to end of line)

[1] see "man 2 stat" section "The following flags are defined for the
st_mode field" for details

(note that the option flags are different below, -c vs -f)

On cygwin/Unix: stat -c "%Y %s %i %f %g %u %d %n"
On MacOSX: stat -f "%m %z %i %p %g %u %d %N"
