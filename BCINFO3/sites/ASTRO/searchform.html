<h4>Notes</h4>

This form provides limited access to the conjunctions database.

<p>

If you know SQL well, you can access the full database at <a
href="http://astro.db.mysql.barrycarter.info/">http://astro.db.mysql.barrycarter.info/</a>.
The database has no instructions, so, if you don't know SQL (MySQL
engine) well, this won't be very useful.

<p>

When you click "view results", the bottom of the results page will
show the query that created your results. If you know SQL moderately
well, you can modify this query to refine your results.

<p>

The default search is limited to 200 rows. You can remove this
limitation on the results page by removing "LIMIT 200" from the
query. However...

<p>

Queries are limited to 5 seconds of CPU time (which can be more than 5
seconds of clock time). If your results time out repeatedly (or you
run into any other problems), please feel free to contact me at
astro@barrycarter.info

<p>

The "Nearest Star" and "Star Distance (degrees)" indicates the star
closest to the conjunction and its angular distance. However, these
fields were computed as an afterthought, so you should not rely on
them.

<p>

A list of all 447,159 conjunctions is available at <a
href="http://test.barrycarter.info/ASTRO/">http://test.barrycarter.info/ASTRO/</a>. This
file is 18.6M compressed, and 56.0M uncompressed.

<p>

You can't search for "nearest star" name or distance using the form
above, but you can so using direct access to the database. However, I
don't recommend this since the star names aren't always what you
expect, and the star names/distance were computed at the last minute
and may not be accurate.

<p>

Do not rely on this information. You can (and should) check this
information against a planetarium program (like Stellarium) and/or
NASA HORIZONS (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons). Of course, neither
of these is necessarily 100% accurate either.
