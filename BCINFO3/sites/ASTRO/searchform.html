<h4>Notes</h4>

This form provides limited access to the conjunctions database, which
lists conjunctions of the visible planets (Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus) from -13001 to 16999 (which are (almost)
the limiting times for which NASA provides planetary position
information).

<p>

To search for all conjunctions involving Mars (for example), first run
a query choosing Mars as Planet 1 and setting Planet 2 to "Any
Planet".  This will find when Mars conjuncts Jupiter, Saturn, or
Uranus.

<p>

Then, run a second query, choosing Mars as Planet 2 and setting Planet
1 to "Any Planet". This will find when Mars conjuncts Mercury or Venus.

<p>

Of course, if you're accessing the database directly, you can use
"Mars in (p1,p2)" (for example).

<p>

If you know SQL well, you can access the full database at <a
href="http://astro.db.mysql.barrycarter.info/">http://astro.db.mysql.barrycarter.info/</a>.
The database has no instructions, so, if you don't know SQL (MySQL
engine) well, this won't be very useful.

<p>

When you click "view results", the bottom of the results page will
show the query that created your results. If you know SQL moderately
well, you can modify this query to refine your results.

<p>

The default search is limited to 200 rows. You can remove this
limitation on the results page by removing "LIMIT 200" from the
query. However...

<p>

Queries are limited to 5 seconds of CPU time (which can be more than 5
seconds of clock time). If your results time out repeatedly (or you
run into any other problems), please feel free to contact me at
astro@barrycarter.info

<p>

The "Nearest Star" and "Star Distance (degrees)" indicates the star
closest to the conjunction and its angular distance. However, these
fields were computed as an afterthought, so you should not rely on
them.

<p>

A list of all 447,159 conjunctions is available at <a
href="http://test.barrycarter.info/ASTRO/">http://test.barrycarter.info/ASTRO/</a>. This
file is 18.6M compressed, and 56.0M uncompressed.

<p>

You can't search for "nearest star" name or distance using the form
above, but you can so using direct access to the database. However, I
don't recommend this since the star names aren't always what you
expect, and the star names/distance were computed at the last minute
and may not be accurate.

<p>

In general, I use Bayer of Flamsteed designations for star names (eg,
"alfLEO" instead of "Regulus"). A full list of stars in the database:

<p>

Do not rely on this information. You can (and should) check this
information against a planetarium program (like Stellarium) and/or
NASA HORIZONS (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons). Of course, neither
of these is necessarily 100% accurate either. Additional disclaimers
below.

<p>

I used the Earth-Moon barycenter (not the center of the Earth) for my
calculations. The Earth-Moon barycenter is about 3000 miles from the
Earth's center (and thus 1000 miles below the surface), which means
it's between 1000 and 7000 miles from any given Terran observer.
Because the planets are fairly far away, this does not introduce much
of an error. If I were computing lunar conjunctions, this would have a
major effect on the calculations.

<p>

I used planetary system barycenters (the center of mass of a planet
and its moons) for an entirely different reason. If you ask HORIZONS
(http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?horizons) for the position of Mars and set
the date, you'll see this notice:

<p>

Available time span for currently selected target body:
1900-Jan-04 to 2500-Jan-04 CT.

<p>

However, if you use Mars' barycenter, this becomes:

<p>

Available time span for currently selected target body:
BC 9998-Mar-20 to AD 9999-Dec-31 CT.

<p>

In other words, NASA computes the position of Mars' planetary system
barycenter for a much longer interval than they compute Mars' actual
position. Since I wanted to compute conjunctions for a long period of
time, I went with the barycenters (DE430 computes barycenters even
beyond 9998 BC and 9999 AD).

<p>

I've complained that this is silly, especially for Mars, since the
distance between Mars' center and Mars' planetary system barycenter is
only about 20cm (yes, centimeters, since Phobos and Deimos have very
little mass) per
http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/aareadme_de430-de431.txt. However,
NASA apparently plans to keep it this way.

<p>

I ignore light travel time, which introduces a small error. Most
planetarium programs, like Stellarium, ignore light travel time by
default, although Stellarium has an option to turn it on.

<p>

I ignore things like refraction, aberration, and similar minor adjustments.

<p>

If you are using Stellarium to verify/view these conjunctions, note
that Stellarium appears to have difficulty with dates before -4800 Mar
1, so you may not be able to verify conjunctions prior to this date.

<p>

The database only includes conjunctions between the visible planets
(Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus). It does not
include conjunctions/occultations involving Neptune, the Moon, the
Sun, the (other) stars, or any asteroids/minor planets.

<p>

The database will tell you the angular distance to the Sun, and the
angular distance to the nearest (non-solar) star, but that's not the
same thing.

<p>

When you use the search form to query, you received a "prettified"
version of the results. If you are accessing the tables directly, here
is a description of the fields:

<pre>

p1: The first planet to conjunct. This is the conjuncting planet
closer to the Sun.

p2: The second planet to conjunct. This is the conjuncting planet
farther from the Sun.

p3 through p6: the main conjunction table is p2, which lists
conjunctions of 2 planets; if you are looking for conjunctions of 3 or
more planets, you can query p3, p4, p5, and p6 respectively. Each of
these tables have extra fields for the extra planets.

jd: The Julian date of the conjunction, probably useful only to techies

year/month/day: The year, month, and day of the conjunction. As per
standard astronomical convention
(http://www.stellarium.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#.22There_is_no_year_0.22.2C_or_.22BC_dates_are_a_year_out.22),
0 stands for the year 1BCE, -1 stands for the year 2BCE, and so on.

MySQL's DATETIME type only supports years back to 1000, so I could not
use the DATETIME field here; instead, I broke the date into three
fields.

time: The UTC time of the conjunction

sep: The angular separation between the conjuncting planets, in
degrees. For more than two planets, this is maximum angular separation
between any pair of planets.

solarsep: The angular separation (in degrees) from the Sun of the
conjuncting planet nearest to the Sun. Conjunctions close to the Sun
can be difficult to see. Of course, Mercury (and to a lesser extent,
Venus) are always close to the Sun, so conjunctions involving these
planets will always be somewhat close to the Sun.

star: The visible star closest to the conjunction; mostly provided as
an afterthought, to get a general idea where the conjunction occurs

starsep: The distance from 'star' (above) to the conjunction. Again,
this is provided as an afterthought, and isn't really that important.
