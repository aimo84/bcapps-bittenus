On conquerclub.com, I sometimes have trouble seeing what borders what
on a given map, so I created these <a href="MAPS">digraph "simplified"
maps</a> using graphviz and <a
href="http://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/bc-conquerclub-xml2dot.pl">
this Perl script</a>.

<p>

You can also see the <a href="GRAPHS">graph definition files
(.dot)</a>.

<p>

DISCLAIMER: This is a first attempt. There are many errors and many
maps are unusable or ugly.
