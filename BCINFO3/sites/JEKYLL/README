Testing Jekyll here; may replace wordpress

Startup:

# major ugliness: centos 7.2 epel repos have ruby 2.0.0 only, had to
# dl ruby 2.4 from gentoo and install OVER yum (didn't "yum remove
# ruby" first, too many deps)

# required for me?

# this took ages to get right:
sudo gem install jekyll bundler


rehash
jekyll new myblog
cd myblog
bundle exec jekyll serve

TODO: does disqus support trackbacks? (my logfile should catch but...)

TODO: convert quora storeis to this blog?

TODO: convert some stack answers to this blog? (instead of just linking?)
