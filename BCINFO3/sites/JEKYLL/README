Subject: Canonical, numbered list of jokes?

Apologies if not appropriate for this forum, but this is there a "canonical" list of numbered jokes? Googling around shows lists of specific types of jokes, but there's no "global joke list", and many of these lists are deliberately short (eg, "the best 21 elephant jokes"). The closest I've found to a "true" archive is http://www.netfunny.com/rhf/, but even these jokes aren't numbered. I'm also familiar with https://jcdverha.home.xs4all.nl/scijokes/ where the jokes *are* numbered, but this list is limited to academic jokes.

Given the frequency with which certain jokes are retold (there's even a meta-joke about jokes being told by number), it seems that such a list must exist, even it's for academic, not humorous purposes.

I realize there's a meta

https://politics.stackexchange.com/questions/25121/does-this-interpretation-of-the-2nd-amendment-prove-that-individuals-should-hot [question was later deleted completely]

I've upvoted your question and asked that it be reopened, but I think it should be phrased more neutrally. However, to answer it as it stands, here are several reasons your argument could be considered wrong:

  - Ambiguity of "people": The 4th Amendment starts (emphasis added) "The right of the **people** to be secure in their persons...". In this case, it's clear that people refers to individual persons, not the people as a whole. So, your argument that "people" **necessarily** means a group is invalid.

  - Plurality of "people": even if you interpret people to be plural, does that mean 2 people can apply to keep and bear arms? How large of a group must it be to become "the people"?

  - "Bear arms": while you can imagine a group of people keeping arms, it's harder to imagine a group "bearing arms". I would argue that only individuals can "bear arms", and thus the amendment applies to individuals.

  - Initial clause is not limiting. Grammatically, the "well regulated militia being necessary" clause is descriptive, not limiting. It does not say: "the only reason people can keep and bear arms is because we need a well regulated militia". Rather, it says "the people can keep and bear arms; one reason out of many is because a well regulated militia is necessary". The amendment is grammatically equivalent to "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed".

  - Non-literal interpretation of amendments: The 1st Amendment states in part (emphasis added) "Congress shall make **no law** respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or **abridging the freedom of speech**". However, Congress has made plenty of laws against fraud, assault, and the various States (which fall under this Amendment by virtue of the 14th Amendment) have made laws against slander and libel. While trying to deduce the literal grammatical interpretation of amendments is an interesting intellectual exercise, the fact is that we don't (and probably shouldn't) always interpret them literally.

Your supporting arguments are considerably weaker:

  - "The purpose of a nation is to bring people together". Not necessarily. The purpose of a nation could be to secure individual rights and to allow people to live in freedom as they choose, even if (and especially if) the majority disagrees with them. One of our greatest freedoms is the right to be left alone, not "brought together".

  - "In case a tyrannical government starts a civil war, if every random person had the possibility to cause great harm with zero coordination with one another, it would add to the turmoil, and hardly be helpsome". It's not clear to me that this is necessarily true. In fact, if we assume the government troops identify themselves (which they must, in order to be tyrannical), having everyone attack the government would be a viable method of attack.

  - "moments of peace with the government, which is such a moment as of right now". Not everyone would agree we are with peace with the government right now. Some people would argue that the current government is tyrannical, and there **is** a "civil war" in progress, albeit an undeclared one.

  - "if the leadership of said militia is willing to grant it". This flies directly in the face of the 2nd Amendment's "the right of the **people**". You now seem to be giving individuals leadership power, which is in direct opposition to your earlier argument.

  - "this is how it works with any army in the world". Except that the main body of the Constitution explicitly allows for an Army and Navy. If the militia were meant to be an Army, there would have been no need to amend the Constitution. Clearly, the militia is deliberately intended to be separate from the Army and Navy.

  - "allow citicizens to form a militia". OK, but how would this work? What process would be used to insure the rights of the **people** are preserved, and it's not just the government determining whether or not citizens can form a militia.

  - "every person fearing a tyrannical government would gain access to weapons if need be, since the organisation granting those weapons is not the government but the people-led militia". OK, but who organizes and defines the "people-led militia"? The government? Once you allow the government to decide who constitutes "the people", you've lost the people's right to fight a tyrannical government.

Of course, even now, the government ultimately decides who can and can't have arms and which arms they can and can't have. However, restricting this right further would not only violate individual freedom, but make it harder for the **people** to form a militia if and when it becomes necessary.

Ultimately, it's much harder to stop the people if individuals have weapons. If the weapons are locked away, all a tyrannical government has to do is control the storage lockers. When people bring their own arms to a militia, the **people** can form the militia, without worrying whether the government will allow them to do so.

Subject: How to find a file

Thoughts:

  - You could try using a hard link, though I'm not sure it'll work.

  - You could create the symlink on a non exfat drive and have the target point to a file on the exfat drive, since soft links can cross drive boundaries.

  - If you have no other drive to implement the above, you could even create a small ext4fs system using "mke2fs", loop mounting it, and then linking from it to the exfat system.

  - If you create a shortcut in Windows, Linux *may* see it as a '.lnk' file, but you won't be able to use it like a symbolic link.

My only concern would be the hard coding of 15, 20, and 25, and the redundant code used to handle these 3 values:

    Private Function GetTip() As Double
        If (Tip15.Checked) Then
            Return PriceBox.Text * 0.15
        ElseIf (Tip20.Checked) Then
            Return PriceBox.Text * 0.2
        ElseIf (Tip25.Checked) Then
            Return PriceBox.Text * 0.25
        End If
    End Function

    Private Sub Tip15_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Tip15.CheckedChanged
        If TotalBox.Text <> "" Then
            TotalBox.Text = Format(CalcTotal(), "currency")
        End If
    End Sub
    Private Sub Tip20_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Tip20.CheckedChanged
        If TotalBox.Text <> "" Then
            TotalBox.Text = Format(CalcTotal(), "currency")
        End If
    End Sub
    Private Sub Tip25_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles Tip25.CheckedChanged
        If TotalBox.Text <> "" Then
            TotalBox.Text = Format(CalcTotal(), "currency")
        End If
    End Sub

You might want to add more values later (18% seems to be a new popular tip value for some reason) or edit the existing values, so hardcoding isn't a great idea, design/style wise.

    First of all, let us assume for a moment that these gun control proponents actually are attempting to appeal to emotion.... is that so wrong? People are not 100 % logical rational human beings. Often, it necessitates an emotional link before people become invested in a topic, and it is only once people are interested that the fact-based compelling arguments will work on them. For example, if I say war is bad because it kills many people, if somebody is emotionally uninvested, they may not be convinced by the idea of many people dying. Hence, is it really fallacious of me to say "how would you feel if you or your family was bombed?". Here, I am appealing to emotion, but I am not doing so to manipulate them, but rather to make them realize the true strength of my original argument.


%%%%%%%%

**"let us assume for a moment that these gun control proponents actually are attempting to appeal to emotion.... is that so wrong?"**

No, because they are, as you say, **gun control proponents**. Their goal is not to reach a logical solution, but rather to convince others that they are right.

I think you are actually two different questions in your first point:

  - Is appeal to emotion an effective way to convince people to support your position? The answer here is yes, which is why so many speakers use it.

  - 

"Appeal to emotion" is wrong when it's used to make a deceptive (and thus fallacious) argument.

In your example, "war is bad because it kills many people" is a deceptive argument because it doesn't address the potential benefits of war. Instead of saying "how would you feel if you or your family was bombed?", you could ask "how would you feel in you lived in constant terror of persecution?" or "wouldn't you rather die on your feet than live on your knees?" or "give me liberty or give me death".

It doesn't show the "true strength of [your] original argument"; rather, it makes your argument appear stronger than it really is, since you do not provide a similar appeal to emotion for the opposing argument.

**** PEOPLE ARE IRRAT

because it can be used to make people accept illogical arguments. 

You are wrong on both counts.

"Appeal to emotion" is wrong because it can be used to make people accept illogical arguments.

You need to find or create a Mersenne Twister [rainbow table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table). In other words, pre-compute all (or some subset) possible outputs, store them (time-space tradeoff), and compare the series you receive to the stored series.

The article quoted in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6618836/how-if-at-all-does-a-predictable-random-number-generator-get-more-secure-after suggests the number of values you need to store may be much smaller.

%

    Secondly, I don't think the premise that gun control proponents actually are appealing to emotion is necessarily true. When a mass shooting occurs, this strengthens the argument of the gun control proponents, since mass shootings is exactly what their gun policies are meant to prevent in the first place. Hence, after a mass shooting, their argument is not stronger than it was before, and therefore it makes perfectly good sense for them to restate this stronger version of their position in the hopes of now being able to convince more people.

Your second point is incorrect and is easily rebutted.

Suppose someone opposed driving cars, and, everytime there was a fatal car accident, claimed their position was strengthened.

This argument is invalid because people who support driving cars already know and understand that fatal car accidents will occur, and accept it as one of the risks of driving cars that presumably does not outweigh the benefit. In other words, each new fatal car accident does not provide any new information or a new argument: it is a position driving supporters have heard, considered, and reached a decision on.

No sane opponent of gun control denies that guns (knives, bombs, cars, snakes, battery acid, etc) can kill or harm innocent people, either by accident or intentionally.

They have already reached the conclusion that the harm of gun control outweighs the benefits. Each new incident does not provide a new argument.

Suppose, for example, that gun control opponents had provided a reasonable explanation of why gun control is bad after the last mass shooting.

You claim that the new mass shooting weakens their argument, but it doesn't. They can use the exact same argument as before: "we've explained previously that gun control is a bad idea despite all the mass shootings through yesterday; the exact same explanation applies to the mass shooting today, and will apply to all mass shootings in the future. We are already aware that mass shootings have occurred and may continue to occur, and explained why gun control is a bad idea despite these mass shootings".

A weaker argument would be: "the infrequency of mass shootings demonstrates that current gun control laws are adequate; if the laws were inadequate, mass shootings would be a leading cause of death, and they are not".

Another form of this argument: "if gun control laws were inadequate, over 1,000 people would die daily from mass shootings; the fact that this mass shooting killed fewer than 1,000 people AND that there has not been mass shooting deaths of 1,000 people daily, proves that gun control laws are sufficient. Each mass shooting reminds us how rare mass shootings are, just like each airplane crash reminds how safe air travel is (the media doesn't report on trivial events). Therefore, this shooting is actually proof that gun control laws are adequate".

Your first point is interesting and resulted in a [long debate between me and @jobermark](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/66730/discussion-between-barrycarter-and-jobermark) which doesn't answer the question, but may be of interest.

To summarize, I would say appeal to emotion in a moral argument isn't a logical fallacy per se, provided that we accept morality is ultimately based on emotion, provided that you don't make any other logical fallacies while employing the argument.

In your "war is bad" example, you are making a one-sided argument (you're not providing emotional arguments that living under oppression is worse than death, for example), but not one that is inherently illogical. Here's how I would breakdown your logic:

  - You: War is bad because it kills people

  - Opp: I accept that war kills people, but don't accept that killing people is bad.

  - You: What if it was your family that was being killed?

  - Opp: Yes, it would be bad if my family were being killed.

  - You: Do you believe your family is morally superior to all other people?

  - Opp: No, there are other good people in the world. Therefore, if it is morally wrong that my family were killed, it is also morally wrong that other people (not all other people, but at least some other people) are being killed. I recant my earlier position that killing people isn't bad.

  - You: Therefore, you accept war is bad because it kills people:

    - A: War kills people (you accepted this statement originally)

    - B: Killing people is bad (you now accept this statement)

    - Therefore, C: War is bad.

  - Opp: This argument is invalid because war does many things, not just kill people. Additionally, although I agreed killing people is bad, I didn't agree that anything that kills people is bad: it's quite possible something kills people (bad) but also has benefits (good). You have convinced me that killing people is bad, but not that it is a bad that can not be mitigated.

My thoughts:

  - From the VPS, try things like `host -t mx xyz.com`, and, when you get a result like `mail.xyz.com`, do something like `ncat mail.xyz.com 25` or even `telnet mail.xyz.com`. This will test if things are working at a much lower level.

  - From your home machine, try `ncat my-vps-server 25` to confirm it fails, and then `ncat my-vps-server 587` to make sure it works.

  - The error message you're getting `cluster5.eu.messagelabs.com[195.245.230.51]:25: Connection timed out` is coming when your VPS tries to connect to a remote server on SMTP port 25. It has nothing to do with how your home machine connects to your VPS.

  - My own ghetto solution (which works, but is ugly): `sudo ssh -L 25:127.0.0.1:25 user@yourvps.com`, creating an ssh tunnel between your machine's port 25 and your VPS' port 25.

Some words that may describe the concept you seek:

  - **charity**: if the resources are given freely to the poor

  - **[noblesse oblige](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noblesse_oblige)**: formally, the belief that nobility has a responsibility to others in society, including the poor; informally, the belief that all rich people have this responsibility.

  - **social justice**: if you believe people are poor due to circumstances beyond their control, society has an obligation to help them

  - **social welfare**: the belief that society has an obligation to help the poor, regardless of why they are poor

Many religions make giving to the poor mandatory:

  - [Tzedakah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzedakah) in Judaism

  - [Zakat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakat) in Islam

  - [Vand Chhako](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vand_Chhako) in Sikhism, a mandatory form of [Dana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C4%81na)

  - doubtless many others

and many others regard it as a virtue.

Many countries also tax the rich to support the poor through [social programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare)

To summarize, the concept that the rich have a religious, moral and legal duty to help the poor exists in many forms with many names.

Wikipedia commits the following logical fallacies in the quoted paragraph:

  - Cherrypicking. The definition comes from a single source, John Ayto's "Twentieth century words" published by Oxford University Press.

  - Unverifiable source. Since books.google.com does not have electronic text for this book, I was unable to confirm the entire definition actually comes from the book.

  - Contradicts better established source by same publisher. https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/conspiracy_theory defines conspiracy theory in its entirety as "A belief that some covert but influential organization is responsible for a circumstance or event." There is no mention of the term being derogatory. The online dictionary is maintained by the Oxford University Press, the same organization that publishes "Twentieth century words". However, the site is intended to be an actual dictionary, where as "Twentieth century words" is intended to be a work of entertainment.

  - Contradicts respected dictionaries. Webster's dictionary defines conspiracy theory as "a theory that explains an event or set of circumstances as the result of a secret plot by usually powerful conspirators" (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conspiracy%20theory) with no mention of it being derogatory.

  - Contradicts other wikimedia sources. Wiktionary gives two definitions of conspiracy theory: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/conspiracy_theory -- the primary definition is "A hypothesis alleging that the members of a coordinated group are, and/or were, secretly working together to commit illegal or wrongful actions including attempting to hide the existence of the group and its activities. In notable cases the hypothesis contradicts the mainstream explanation for historical or current events". It is only the second definition that states "Hypothetical speculation that is commonly considered untrue or outlandish". Usage notes also clarifies that the term is not derogatory: "The phrase conspiracy theory is sometimes used in an attempt to imply that hypothetical speculation is not worthy of serious consideration, usually with phrasing indicative of dismissal (e.g., "just a conspiracy theory"). However, any particular instance of use is not necessarily pejorative. Some consider it inappropriate to use the phrase "conspiracy theory" in an attempt to dismissively discredit hypothetical speculation in any form."

  - Edit history suggests active censorship. While it's hard to tell with Wikipedia, the edit history https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conspiracy_theory&action=history's comments and content indicate consistent censorship. Examples:

    - "Mixing up verified conspiracies with conspiracy theory is misleading"

    - In https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Conspiracy_theory&diff=804439748&oldid=795751074, a user uses the Webster's dictionary definition verbatim, noting "I have changed your EXTREMELY biased definition to the WEBSTER dictionary CORRECT definition. Seeing as you guys just let this be completely biased, which is beyond disgusting". The edit is reverted in less than 30 minutes.

    - Every edit that validates conspiracy theories with actual proven conspiracies is reverted.

Because anyone can edit wikipedia, this doesn't necessarily mean there's a conspiracy re editing the conspiracy theory page, despite my joke in the comments. However, the page is clearly being edited/reverted by people who want to discredit conspiracy theories.

Subject: How to use Jekyll locally to create/edit posts on remote WordPress?

How do I use Jekyll on my local machine to create/edit posts on my remote WordPress blog? More specifically:

  - I want to write posts in plain text, use Jekyll's markup parser to create HTML, and then post the resulting HTML to my WordPress site.

  - If I edit an existing local text file, I want the corresponding WordPress post edited. I don't care if revision history is preserved on WordPress, since I plan on preserving it locally.

Is there a tool/plugin/procedure that can do this efficiently? While I believe I could write such a tool, I'd prefer to use a well-tested existing tool.

Rationale: I really like the idea of having a website stored/generated locally and then mirrored to a server, in part because that was the *only* way to do things when I first started posting to the Web.

However, I feel Jekyll's lack of comments, trackbacks, and server-side scripting (though JavaScript may suffice) are not *quite* sufficient for my needs, especially since I want to avoid using third party tools such as Disqus, or even a local version of Disqus that runs in parallel to my blog.

Any help appreciated!

This is more of a rant than an answer, but I'm starting to think it's impossible to debate anything meaningful without making a logical fallacy or resorting to axiomatic thinking. Reasoning:

  - There are plenty of examples of logical fallacies, but very few (no?) examples of valid logical arguments for controversial issues. In other words, if you're going to debate a controversial issue, you won't get very far with a purely logical argument.

  - *Even if* we could get everyone to understand the rules of logic (and many people don't) and agree on what constitutes a logical fallacy, we would then have to debate fundamental principles or axioms.

So, when people ask "why can't everyone discuss controversial issue X logically", the answer is: because it's literally impossible to determine or even agree on fundamental axiomatic truth. We know we exist ("I think; therefore I am"), but everything outside that is speculation.

So, not only are arguments with logical fallacies more convincing (to most people), they're also the *only* arguments you can actually make.
