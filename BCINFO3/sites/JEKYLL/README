Testing Jekyll here; may replace wordpress

Startup:

# major ugliness: centos 7.2 epel repos have ruby 2.0.0 only, had to
# dl ruby 2.4 from gentoo and install OVER yum (didn't "yum remove
# ruby" first, too many deps)

# required for me?

# this took ages to get right:
sudo gem install jekyll bundler


rehash
jekyll new myblog
cd myblog
bundle exec jekyll serve


TODO: write entries re why jekyll sucks (repeats 1990s stuff) + why it's a pain in the ass to install
