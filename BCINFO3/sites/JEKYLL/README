Testing Jekyll here; may replace wordpress

Startup:

# major ugliness: centos 7.2 epel repos have ruby 2.0.0 only, had to
# dl ruby 2.4 from gentoo and install OVER yum (didn't "yum remove
# ruby" first, too many deps)

# required for me?
sudo yum upgrade ruby
sudo gem install jekyll bundler
rehash
jekyll new myblog
