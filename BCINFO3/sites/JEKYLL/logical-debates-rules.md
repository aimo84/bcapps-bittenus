Subject: I seek logical debate


TODO: credentials, logical fallaces, stat fallacies as subset, particular verbosity (incl book, multipage site, cutting/pasting), argue the rules themselves, agree on facts/aximsios/reliable sources, ok to republish in entirty (but not edited unless we agree), point by point not spam, reply and reply + not monologue, interupptiosn ok (voice unlikely)
