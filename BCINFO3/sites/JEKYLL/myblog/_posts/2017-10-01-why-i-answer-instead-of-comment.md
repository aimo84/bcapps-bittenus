Effective 1 Oct 2017 00:00:00 UTC, I am making more of an effort to answer StackExchange posts, instead of merely commenting on them. Why?

  - I've been told previously that my comments should be answers.

  - Answers can be edited, both to add explanations and to correct errors. Comments can only be edited for 5 minutes.

  - Answers can be of arbitrary length. Comments are of limited length. This is particularly frustrating if you want to add just a little more information to a comment and run out of room.

  - There are many StackExchange posts where comments effectively answer the question, but the OP has no way of closing the question, because there is no answer to upvote/accept. By posting answers, I'm hoping more questions will be closed and stop showing up on the "unanswered questions" list.

  - If I understand correctly, posting an answer means the question cannot be deleted, even if overly aggressive StackExchange moderators feel it is a poor question. I may be wrong about this point.
