If you were directed here by me, Barry Carter:

  - You probably posted a question on a q-and-a site that was long and rambling, and heavily downvoted or closed.

  - I am willing to help you improve your question, or even try to answer your question via live Google Hangouts text chat. Please contact me at carter.barry@gmail.com via Google Hangouts.

Regardless of whether you contact me, here are some general tips:

  - If your post is a single paragraph, break it down into smaller paragraphs or even bullet points.

  - If you make claims that are not well-known, provide a reliable source.

  - If you're asking multiple questions, break them into separate posts. If you are making multiple claims in a single question, separate them so the supporting sentences for one claim are in the same portion of the message as the claim itself.

  - If you're using unusual units (measuring stellar distances in furlongs for example), briefly indicate the original unit. Example: "Our closest stellar neighbor is 200 trillion furlongs (4.367 light years) away".
