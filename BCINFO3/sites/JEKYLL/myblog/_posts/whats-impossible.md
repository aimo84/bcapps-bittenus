If your system of mathematics is consistent, proving that 0 = 1 is impossible. You could also invent your language/system and declare that certain things are impossible in that language by definition. However, I don't think that's what you're asking.

What's impossible in the physical world? Surprisingly little:

  - **The Sun won't rise tomorrow**. It's possible that our understanding of the Sun is completely wrong, and that it will go nova, shrink to a white dwarf and burn out entirely before tomorrow morning.

TODO: physical laws are observatiosn, gravity constant measurements overlap, CERN light speed epxeriment, if both gravity/light increasing = consistent, microentropy increases due to quantum, quantum allows anything n general, cons of matter even exlu e=mc^2 via white/black holes

TODO: cna't be both X and not X at the smae time
