<center><h1>Remove Trump Now!</h1></center><p>

Since Donald Trump hasn't yet assumed the Presidency, you can't
actually remove him from office (it was just a clever available domain
name), but you can prevent him from taking office in the first
place. How?

<p>

Quoting <a href="https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/provisions.html">the Constitution</a> (emphasis added):

<blockquote>  
  Each State shall appoint, <b>in such Manner as the Legislature thereof
may direct</b>, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of
Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the
Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an
Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed
an Elector.
</blockquote>

In other words, a state legislature does not have an obligation to
appoint electors based on the popular plurality vote, even if an
election has already been held.

<p>

Call, visit, write, or email your state legislators (and maybe those
of other states) where Trump won and tell them to choose non-Trump
electors. Here's a sample letter (please customize it with your own
thoughts, don't make it look like a form letter, see also notes
below the letter):

<blockquote>

Dear [name of representative], 
<p>
On November 8th, the majority of [state resident name, eg
"Michiganders"] and the majority of Americans voted against Donald
Trump.
<p>
If it hadn't been for a small minority of third party protest voters, 
Hillary Clinton would've won the election. 
<p>
Those voters are kicking themselves now, because they know, as you 
know, and as we all know, that a Trump Presidency means disaster: not 
just for [state name], but for the entire United States as a whole.
<p>
In addition to the Presidency, the Republicans control both houses of
Congress AND the President will appoint the next Supreme Court
justice. We must insure that this President is not Donald Trump.
<p>
The last time a President was elected by a minority, George Bush Jr
took office, resulting in 9/11.
<p>
Fortunately, there's something even more powerful than an egotistical
maniac: the Constitution of the United States of America.
<p>
Talk to your constituents, especially those who voted for third-party 
candidates and ask your fellow legislators to do the same. Your 
constituents will tell you: if they had known Trump would win, they 
would've happily changed their protest vote to prevent a Trump 
Presidency.   
<p>
And then, do the right thing, and invoke your Constitutional right and 
duty to appoint electors the way your constituents want: for Hillary 
Clinton, and not for Donald Trump. 
<p>
Don't let a small minority of regretful voters ruin your great state 
and our great nation. 

</blockquote>

Note there are 6 states for which the second paragraph applies (if
you're not writing the legislatures of one of these states, edit the
second paragraph):<ul>

<li>Florida (29 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 128,503 votes, and there were 293,802 votes for third party candidates. If 43.74% of them had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

<li>Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 68,012 votes, and there were 212,508 votes for third party candidates. If 32.00% of them had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

<li>Michigan (16 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 17,386 votes, and there were 241,125 votes for third party candidates. If 7.21% of them had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

<li>Arizona (11 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 81,607 votes, and there were 94,917 votes for third party candidates. If 85.98% of them had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

<li>Wisconsin (10 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 26,889 votes, and there were 152,773 votes for third party candidates. If 17.60% of them had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

<li>Utah (6 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 125,851 votes, and there were 192,096 votes for third party candidates. If 65.51% of them had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

</ul>

Of these, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin have the closest
margins, and the 46 electoral votes they could provide would be enough
to change the election results. If you're going to contact only three
states, these would be the ones. Of course, if you want to contact
more states (perhaps all 26 which "chose" Trump), that's even better.
