I've been sloppy about keeping my blogs/pages up to date since one of
the machines I was hosting on broke + I wasn't able to restore files
properly.<p>

For now, here are some links with actual content: <ul>


<li>My blog (<a href="http://wordpress.barrycarter.info/">http://wordpress.barrycarter.info/</a>)</li>

<li>My StackExchange profile which inclues my contact information (<a href="https://stackexchange.com/users/144803/barrycarter">https://stackexchange.com/users/144803/barrycarter</a>)</li>

</ul>
