% "this directory" refers to https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/BRIGHTON/

% I am installing from an old Fedora Core 11 machine (hereafter called
"dullon") using ssh and vncserver to access a my new machine; for
testing, I will create a VM version of it first, and then follow the
same steps to create it in production.

% To create a CentOS 7 machine that runs VirtualBox, see
"bc-install-virtualbox-on-centos7.txt" in this directory.. This
machine is hereafter called "brighton"

% To create a CentOS 7 virtual machine (hereafter called
"babybrighton"), see bc-create-vm-with-virtualbox.txt in this
directory.

% OPTIONAL: on dullon add a line like this to /etc/hosts so you can
access the machine as babybrighton

192.168.0.100 babybrighton 

%% TODO: whine about default CentOS7 not enable network (+ not even
showing option until you choose partitioning) -- maybe take screenshot

%% TODO: disclaim why I'm using VirtualBox over KVM (/dev/sdb only!)

%% TODO: merge CENTOS/FEDORA/BRIGHTON dirs into one semi-coherent mass

%% TODO: disclaim everything

This documents my attempt to setup "brighton", a new CentOS 7.2
machine, first as a VM, and later as a physical machine. My current
machine is running Fedora Core 11, and I will its existing files as a
"fallback" for certain things (eg, binaries and libraries absolutely
not available via CentOS 7.2 or that I am too lazy to install from
tertiary sources) [default install + CentOS 7 included/approved
repositories = primary source, unapproved repositories = secondary
source]

How to read this document:

  - A left flush "%% TODO:" indicates a step I need to do and that is
  not complete yet.

  - A left flush "% IMP:" indicates an important note about the steps
  that follow. You should not follow the steps that come afterwards
  unless you are sure you know what you're doing.

  - A left flush "% NOTE:" indicates a note that is optional reading
  and may explain why a certain step must be performed in a specific
  way and why other reasonable-seeming ways to perform that step may
  not be correct, or a comment on why this step is performed.

  - Any other left flush "% " indicates a step to follow.

% Boot babybrighton in detachable mode and enter disk password

% You no longer need the X window that VirtualBox brings up, so go to
Machine/Detach GUI to get rid of it.

% From dullon, "ssh root@babybrighton"

% I prefer tcsh and many things I do rely on it, so:

yum -y install tcsh
chsh -s /bin/tcsh root
chsh -s /bin/tcsh user

% follow steps in bc-move-root.txt if desired

% run "make" in this directory, so the following rsync will push over
yum-runme.sh

% rsync the latest BCGIT to babybrighton (dullon is 192.168.0.2)

yum -y install rsync
rehash
rsync -Pavz root@192.168.0.2:/home/barrycarter/BCGIT /home/user/

: and private stuff I still need
rsync -Pavz root@192.168.0.2:/home/barrycarter/BCPRIV /home/user/

% Install X11 as a group

: next line just makes group stuff faster in future

yum groups mark convert

: note this only shows up with "yum grouplist hidden" not w/o "hidden"
yum -y groupinstall "X Window System"

% Install "approved" repositories

sh ~user/BCGIT/BRIGHTON/repos.sh

% Create cache of meta data (improves speed):

yum makecache

% and install applydeltarpm to possibly speed things up

yum -y install deltarpm

% run yum-runme.sh as follows:

sh ~user/BCGIT/BRIGHTON/yum-runme.sh |& tee /tmp/yum-runme.out

% Above will say "package not found" for many packages, but, unless it
actually breaks (ie, yum yields an error, not just warnings), you may
wish to snapshot "alpha" here [to be safe, "shutdown -h" first]

% Cut and paste results of below into nopkglist.txt: the packages I
want that CentOS doesn't provide:

fgrep "No package " /tmp/yum-runme.out | perl -anle 'print $F[2]' | sort | uniq | less

% Ugly install of fly (older version, newer is broken)

cd /root/build
cp ~user/Downloads/fly-1.6.5.tar.gz .
tar xvfz fly-1.6.5.tar.gz
cd fly-1.6.5
make
cp fly /usr/local/bin/
cp gd1.3/libgd.a /usr/local/lib/

% run bc-symlinks.sh

sh ~user/BCGIT/BRIGHTON/bc-symlinks.sh |& tee /tmp/bc-symlinks.out

% start the crontab

crontab -u user /home/user/BCGIT/BRIGHTON/bc-public-crontab

%% TODO: compare all lib and bin files from old machine (perhaps using fc11root) and new machine to see what I'm missing

% NOTE: to list all bin and lib files on a machine (which I can use to
compare my current bin files on dullon to those on babybrighton to see
what I'm "missing"):

: there are other /bin and /sbin dirs, but they appear less important
: /bin does not appear directly in CentOS 7, but may on other systems
: /usr/X11R6/bin/ is an archaism from FC11

: of course, these steps could be combined but intermediate files are useful

setenv FOO babybrighton
export FOO="babybrighton"

find /usr/sbin /usr/local/sbin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin /bin /sbin 
 /usr/X11R6/bin/ -type f -o -type l > /tmp/$FOO-binlist0.txt

perl -pnle 's%^.*/%%' /tmp/$FOO-binlist0.txt|sort -u > /tmp/$FOO-binlist1.txt

: can then use comm to compare the two bin lists

%% TODO: above for libs, common names are:

/var/lib /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /lib

%% TODO: consider making this entire document even more specific to me and avoid the "IF THEN" stuff
