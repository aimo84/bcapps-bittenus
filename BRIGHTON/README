% "this directory" refers to https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/BRIGHTON/

% I am installing from an old Fedora Core 11 machine (hereafter called
"dullon") using ssh and vncserver to access a my new machine; for
testing, I will create a VM version of it first, and then follow the
same steps to create it in production.

% To create a CentOS 7 machine that runs VirtualBox, see
"bc-install-virtualbox-on-centos7.txt" in this directory.. This
machine is hereafter called "brighton"

% To create a CentOS 7 virtual machine (hereafter called
"babybrighton"), see bc-create-vm-with-virtualbox.txt in this
directory.

% OPTIONAL: on dullon add a line like this to /etc/hosts so you can
access the machine as babybrighton

192.168.0.100 babybrighton

This documents my attempt to setup "brighton", a new CentOS 7.2
machine, first as a VM, and later as a physical machine. My current
machine is running Fedora Core 11, and I will its existing files as a
"fallback" for certain things (eg, binaries and libraries absolutely
not available via CentOS 7.2 or that I am too lazy to install from
tertiary sources) [default install + CentOS 7 included/approved
repositories = primary source, unapproved repositories = secondary
source]

How to read this document:

  - A left flush "%% TODO:" indicates a step I need to do and that is
  not complete yet.

  - A left flush "% IMP:" indicates an important note about the steps
  that follow. You should not follow the steps that come afterwards
  unless you are sure you know what you're doing.

  - A left flush "% NOTE:" indicates a note that is optional reading
  and may explain why a certain step must be performed in a specific
  way and why other reasonable-seeming ways to perform that step may
  not be correct, or a comment on why this step is performed.

  - Any other left flush "% " indicates a step to follow.

% Boot babybrighton in detachable mode and enter disk password

% You no longer need the X window that VirtualBox brings up, so go to
Machine/Detach GUI to get rid of it.

% From dullon, "ssh root@babybrighton"

% I prefer tcsh and many things I do rely on it, so:

yum -y install tcsh
chsh -s /bin/tcsh root
chsh -s /bin/tcsh user

%% TODO: should I move the steps above elsewhere?

% run "make" in this directory on dullon, so the following rsync will
push over yum-runme.sh

% rsync the latest BCGIT to babybrighton (dullon is 192.168.0.2) from
babybrighton itself

yum -y install rsync
: below may not be needed if still running in sh
rehash
rsync -Pavz root@192.168.0.2:/home/barrycarter/BCGIT /home/user/

: and private stuff I still need
rsync -Pavz root@192.168.0.2:/home/barrycarter/BCPRIV /home/user/

% Install X11 as a group:

: next line just makes group stuff faster in future

yum groups mark convert

: note this only shows up with "yum grouplist hidden" not w/o "hidden"

yum -y groupinstall "X Window System" multimedia

% Install "approved" repositories

sh ~user/BCGIT/BRIGHTON/repos.sh

% Create cache of meta data (improves speed):

yum makecache

% and install applydeltarpm to possibly speed things up

yum -y install deltarpm

% run yum-runme.sh as follows:

: this does skip approx 3 packages due to dependency issues but nothing serious

sh ~user/BCGIT/BRIGHTON/yum-runme.sh |& tee /tmp/yum-runme.out

% and bc-cpan.sh

sh ~user/BCGIT/BRIGHTON/bc-cpan.sh |& tee /tmp/cpan.out

% Consider snapshotting here as "postmassinstall" UNLESS yun-runme.sh
dies on an error (warnings are ok). As always, "shutdown -h" first.

% If needed (or if restoring snapshot here), rsync over BCGIT again

% OPTIONAL: if mounting dullon external drives as though they were
local, add this to /etc/fstab (these are the only two drives that
still exist)

echo "192.168.0.2:/mnt/extdrive2 /mnt/extdrive2 nfs noauto" >> /etc/fstab
echo "192.168.0.2:/mnt/extdrive5 /mnt/extdrive5 nfs noauto" >> /etc/fstab

: NOTE: must turn on mountd on dullon (/etc/init.d/rpcbind start,
: /etc/init.d/nfs start) and make sure /etc/exports actually exports
: these drives to local network

% Disable selinux (I don't need it and it actually breaks nagios [or
does it?]):

printf '1,$s/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/\nwq\n'|ex /etc/selinux/config

% create symlinks:

sh ~user/BCGIT/BRIGHTON/bc-symlinks.sh |& tee /tmp/bc-symlinks.out

% disable/enable services (for next reboot)

sh ~user/BCGIT/BRIGHTON/bc-servicectl.sh |& tee /tmp/bc-servicectl.sh

% Ugly install of fly (older version, newer is broken)

cd /root/build
cp ~user/Downloads/fly-1.6.5.tar.gz .
tar xvfz fly-1.6.5.tar.gz
cd fly-1.6.5
make
cp fly /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fly
: do not appear to need this
: cp gd1.3/libgd.a /usr/local/lib/

% start the crontab

crontab -u user /home/user/BCGIT/BRIGHTON/bc-public-crontab

% NOTE TO SELF: creating snapshot "xable-predb" here since postgresql db
create takes forever

% OPTIONAL: start dbs in wrong way (but works with rc.local) (if doing
right way, see bc-start-db.txt, if I ever get it working)

: we do NOT use systemd and do this instead
systemctl disable postgresql mariadb

: probably already stopped, but...
systemctl stop postgresql mariadb

: setup dbs
mysql_install_db
: below takes a while, "tailf /var/lib/pgsql/initdb.log" to watch
postgresql-setup initdb

: if desired, move SQL home dirs as below

: REMINDER: if moved previously, consider rm -rf /mnt/kemptown/*sql

mv /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/pgsql /mnt/kemptown/
ln -s /mnt/kemptown/mysql /mnt/kemptown/pgsql /var/lib
: should not need to do this, but...
chown -R mysql /mnt/kemptown/mysql

: on next reboot, both dbs should come up fine OR do this in current session
mysqld_safe &
sudo -u postgres pg_ctl -D /var/lib/pgsql/data start

% To import data (mine is in /mnt/kemptown/XFER)

: works wo any special perms or options
mysql < mysqlminidump.txt

: at this point, there are no other users, must do this
sudo -u postgres psql < pgsql-super-dump.txt 

% If desired, "shutdown -h" and create "postdb" snapshot here (this
subsumes "xable", can now start and use X normally)

% Cut and paste results of below into nopkglist.txt: the packages I
want that CentOS doesn't provide:

fgrep "No package " /tmp/yum-runme.out|perl -anle 'print $F[2]'|sort|uniq|less

%% TODO: see bc-start-db.txt (I can't get dbs working, but want to get
their verbiage out of the way)

%% TODO: am snapshotting (after shutdown) here as "Xable"; if this
really does let me use X normally, keep this snapshot; else tweak (aka
can I xinit login at this point?)

%% TODO: explain how to use mount so babybrighton can edit files
directly on dullon in this directory (emacs tramp mode also works)

%% TODO: compare all lib and bin files from old machine (perhaps using
fc11root) and new machine to see what I'm missing

% NOTE: to list all bin and lib files on a machine (which I can use to
compare my current bin files on dullon to those on babybrighton to see
what I'm "missing"):

: there are other /bin and /sbin dirs, but they appear less important
: /bin does not appear directly in CentOS 7, but may on other systems
: /usr/X11R6/bin/ is an archaism from FC11

: of course, these steps could be combined but intermediate files are useful

setenv FOO babybrighton
export FOO="babybrighton"

find /usr/sbin /usr/local/sbin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin /bin /sbin 
 /usr/X11R6/bin/ -type f -o -type l > /tmp/$FOO-binlist0.txt

perl -pnle 's%^.*/%%' /tmp/$FOO-binlist0.txt|sort -u > /tmp/$FOO-binlist1.txt

: can then use comm to compare the two bin lists

%% TODO: above for libs, common names are:

/var/lib /usr/lib /usr/local/lib /lib

%% TODO: consider making this entire document even more specific to me and avoid the "IF THEN" stuff

%% TODO: try to include reference URLs (using Firefox history if
needed) when doing something unusual or difficult

%% TODO: make sure no colon parens and explain why (or go # all the way?)

%% TODO: explain ":" comments

%% TODO: use chkconfig/systemctl on guest to make sure what I want comes up (ps -auxwww or ps -ef to see whats actually running)

%% TODO: look at TODOs from FEDORA and CENTOS and VM

%% TODO: put "significant legacy" note in this dir, ../CENTOS* ../VM/ and ../FEDORA

%% TODO: figure out why /usr/local/bin/surl did to not get transferred
to /fc11oldroot from dullon or whatever (and redo this rsync to keep up?)

%% TODO: consider virtualizing dullon so I can cut over to new machine ASAP

%% TODO: more cpan stuff

%% TODO: fixed IP addr, no NetworkManager

%% TODO: at some point, decide how much to put in shell scripts and
how much to run manually (stuff that needs pw or that I want to verify
= manually?)

%% TODO: create precedence level for TODO, and don't require user to
stop for minor ones (or move minor TODO to end)

own homedir (even does this for root) and it exists (deferred mounting?!)

%% TODO: at what point during login do "group permissions" kick in??

%% TODO: review brighton-procs.txt

%% TODO: make sure daemon-checker complains properly when mysqld not
running (it wasn't for some reason earlier)

%% TODO: instead of installing unavailables from source, consider
using RPMs, but test them and don't let them break anything else
(rpmfind.net?); also, if reinstalling multiple times dont dl the same
RPM repeatedly (store on big drive and check before re-dling)

% REF: when adjusting volume on guests, make sure volume is correct on
brighton, host, as well (serious problems if not)

%% TODO: whine about default CentOS7 not enable network (+ not even
showing option until you choose partitioning) -- maybe take screenshot

so re-rsynced from dullon; have not done any gaim/pidgin stuff on
babybrighton so should not be an issue

%% TODO: note that union mount might seriously break installing new things

%% testing: all overlay mounts together break things, so seeing which ones work

(doing manual "mount default" after reboot, automount is failing badly)

/usr: works fine

/bin: fails though it could just be that multiples fail (or because it's a symlink though I think it worked from cmd line)

/lib: also fails

%% EXP: manual (from cmd line after boot)

: this is too big, sigh, must do piecemeal
