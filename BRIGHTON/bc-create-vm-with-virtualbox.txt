% OPTIONAL: if you want babybrighton (guest) to access raw disks on
brighton (host)
[https://www.howtoforge.com/using-raw-devices-in-virtualbox-vms]:

yum -y install gcc kernel-devel kernel-devel-3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64
/sbin/vboxconfig
: substitute /dev/sdb with the drive you are giving access to
VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename sdb.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sdb

% Run VirtualBox" and use the following parameters when creating
babybrighton as a virtual machine:

  - Linux/Red Hat for the Type and Version (note that if you put
  "centos" [or even "cent"] anywhere in the name, virtualbox will fill
  these automatically)

  - Choose a VDI of at 48G as this will be a fairly large install.

  - Leave everything else as is in the wizard, but, before starting
  the machine go to "Settings" and:

    - Under Network, choose "bridged", promiscuous mode to "Allow All"
    and the MAC address to "080000000000" or something else easily
    recognizable.

    - Under Storage:

      - OPTIONAL: add a vmdk to the SATA controller that is the
      "sdb.vmdk" you created above earlier

      - for the CD, choose CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1511.iso as the
      image to install

  - You may wish to snapshot before installing CentOS 7 or at any
  "critical" point during this entire process. This would be the
  "preinstall" snapshot.

% After starting up babybrighton as a VM, do the following when
installing CentOS 7:

  - OPTIONAL: Since I'll be using /dev/sdb (on brighton) for most
  things, partition so that /home has 5 GiB and delete the swap
  partition entirely. Otherwise, let CentOS choose your partioning
  scheme

  - Enable full disk encryption

  - Make sure to turn "Networking" on (this option only shows after
  you're done paritioning and isn't set by default, sadly)

  - Create root user with a password and "user" user as an
  administrative user w/o a password (we'll be assigning one below
  later).

  - OPTIONAL: After rebooting from install, login as "root", run
  "shutdown -h now", and take a snapshot. This is the "postinstall"
  snapshot.
