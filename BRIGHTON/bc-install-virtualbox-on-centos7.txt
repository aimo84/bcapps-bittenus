% NOTE: this describes how to setup a CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1511.iso
install on a physical machine (named brighton) to run VirtualBox and
vncserver so you can remote into the machine and create VMs on brighton

% NOTE: if you prefer to work on the console directly or use "ssh -X",
installing vncserver is unnecessary.

%% TODO: mention what options to use when installing CentOS 7,

% After rebooting and logging in as root...

% install desktop (this is not minimal, "X Window System" may be
minimal), first creating group indices for future reference

yum groups mark convert
yum -y groupinstall "GNOME Desktop"

% get virtualbox repo

curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/virtualbox.repo http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/rhel/virtualbox.repo

% and install virtualbox, xterm (needed for GNOME desktop, but not
installed sigh), vnc (for remote access), gcc, bzip2 and kernel-devel
for guest additions later

yum -y install VirtualBox-5.1 xterm tigervnc-server gcc kernel-devel-3.10.0-327.el7.x86_64 bzip2

: below may be necessary and doesnt hurt to run

/sbin/vboxconfig

% install guest-additions which allows rdesktop to guest directly (wo
installing vncserver on guest)

cd

curl -O http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/5.1.10/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.1.10-112026.vbox-extpack

chmod +x Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.1.10-112026.vbox-extpack

: per https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch08.html#vboxmanage-extpack

VBoxManage extpack install Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-5.1.10-112026.vbox-extpack

% tigervnc-server turns on the firewall, blocking incoming vnc; to fix
(if you plan to "ssh -X" or use ssh tunneling, this step is
unnecessary)

systemctl disable firewalld

% and set a password so it comes up automatically at reboot:

vncpasswd

% Due to a hideous oversight by CentOS, GNOME/gdm doesnt come up
automatically on reboot and "xinit" starts with no window manager. A
partial fix is to put this line in ~/.xinitrc (which is probably
empty, the first line is to start vnc):

vncserver &
exec gnome-shell

% If you have an encrypted drive, enable it on the host (giving guest
direct access to raw devices is bad) and follow bc-move-root.txt UNTIL
"mount /mnt/kemptown" and then stop (the other steps will occur at the
guest level)

% reboot, login, and run "xinit &"

% You can now vnc into this machine and run virtualbox (may need to
use port 5901 for vnc)

% REMINDER: the process above MAY work on a virtual machine, but
running VirtualBox inside a virtual machine may be unwise
