% NOTE: this describes how to setup a CentOS-7-x86_64-Minimal-1511.iso
install on a physical machine (named brighton) to run VirtualBox and
vncserver so you can remote into the machine and create VMs on brighton

% NOTE: if you prefer to work on the console directly or use "ssh -X",
installing vncserver is unnecessary.

%% TODO: mention what options to use when installing CentOS 7,
particularly network crap (perhaps similar to VM)

% After rebooting and logging in as root:

: this step is optional -- it will create groups, but so will the next command
: if you dont run this one
yum -y grouplist

: install desktop
: this is not minimal, "X Window System" may be minimal
yum -y groupinstall "GNOME Desktop"

: get virtualbox repo
curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/virtualbox.repo http://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/rpm/rhel/virtualbox.repo

: and install virtualbox
: xterm needed for GNOME desktop, but not installed sigh
: vnc so I can access it remotely
: bzip2 and kernel devel for guest additions
yum -y install VirtualBox-5.1 xterm tigervnc-server

% tigervnc-server turns on the firewall, blocking incoming vnc; to fix:

: if you plan to "ssh -X" or use ssh tunneling, this step is unnecessary
systemctl disable firewalld

% and set a password so it comes up automatically at reboot
vncpasswd

% Due to a hideous oversight by CentOS, GNOME/gdm doesnt come up
automatically on reboot and "xinit" starts with on window manager. A
partial fix is to put this line in ~/.xinitrc (which is probably
empty, the first line is to start vnc):

vncserver &
exec gnome-shell

% reboot, login, and run "xinit &"

% You can now vnc into this machine and run virtualbox

% REMINDER: the process above MAY work on a virtual machine, but
running VirtualBox inside a virtual machine may be unwise
