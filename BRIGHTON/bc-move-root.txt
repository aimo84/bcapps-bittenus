% If you have an encrypted non-boot drive (hereafter called
"kemptown"), and want to move /home and create swapspace there
(approximately), follow these steps.

% NOTE: If you've previously tried installing centos on this other
drive, your LVMs may have the same name. If so, see
../FEDORA/lvm-name-conflict.txt

% Set up decryption:

: initially, there is no "/etc/cryptsetup" and "/etc/crypttab" reads:

: luks-id-of-root-partition UUID=id-of-root-partition none

cryptsetup open /dev/sdb3 kemptown

: the use of "less" below is just to check that the file looks the way
: we expect before we do anything

: file should not exist yet
less /etc/cryptsetup
echo "luks /dev/sdb3 -" > /etc/cryptsetup

: should have one entry, the boot drive
less /etc/crypttab
blkid | fgrep /dev/sdb3
: this must be an append, cant overwrite boot drive
echo "luks UUID=the-uuid-given-by-blkid-for-dev-sdb3 none" >> /etc/crypttab

: should have several entries
less /etc/fstab
echo "/dev/mapper/oldfedora-home /mnt/kemptown ext4 defaults,x-systemd.device-timeout=30 60 90" >> /etc/fstab

mkdir /mnt/kemptown
mount /mnt/kemptown

% allow guests on network to mount it

yum -y install nfs-utils
systemctl enable nfs-server
echo "/mnt/kemptown 192.168.0.0/24(rw,no_root_squash)" > /etc/exports

: no need to do these since we will reboot
: systemctl start nfs
: exportfs -a

% NOTE: stop here if on physical machine

% NOTE: start here on virtual machine

% Boot virtual machine and add NFS mount to /etc/fstab:

yum -y install nfs-utils
mkdir /mnt/kemptown
echo "192.168.0.3:/mnt/kemptown /mnt/kemptown nfs" >> /etc/fstab
: step below is optional but check on reboot
mount /mnt/kemptown

% If /mnt/kemptown/swap not already created:

dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/kemptown/swap bs=1000000000 count=128 status=progress&
mkswap /mnt/kemptown/swap
: below as recommended
chmod 0600 /mnt/kemptown/swap

% to automount swapspace:

chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.local

: and then add these lines to /etc/rc.d/rc.local

echo "losetup /dev/loop0 /mnt/kemptown/swap" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local
echo "swapon /dev/loop0" >> /etc/rc.d/rc.local

%% TODO: above step is NOT working from rc.local, will create loop
device, but swap fails, can fix this by running losetup with next loop
device and "swapon" that after reboot or can ignore entirely

%% TODO: rebooting at this step since swap is being weird?

% OPTIONAL: move user's home to /mnt/kemptown:

: if below reports "userdel: user user is currently used by process
: xxxx", kill process xxxx (potentially repeatedly) until the command
: succeeds

userdel user;

: below should show only 3 files or so -- if not, dont rm -rf
find /home/user -type f
rm -rf /home/user

: readd user with new directory
useradd -d /mnt/kemptown/user -g wheel -u 1000 user
passwd user
yum -y install tcsh
chsh -s /bin/tcsh user
: this is useful so I can refer to /home/user
ln -s /mnt/kemptown/user /home

: move root over as well
mv /root /root.old
ln -s /mnt/kemptown/root /root

% to use large drive to cache across rebuilds if necessary, we first
edit yum.conf:

printf '1,$s/keepcache=0/keepcache=1/\nwq\n' | ex /etc/yum.conf 

% and then move /var/cache over to the large drive

: remove the fresh install cache which is nearly empty
find /var/cache -type f
rm -rf /var/cache

: only need to do mkdir once
mkdir -p /mnt/kemptown/var/cache
ln -s /mnt/kemptown/var/cache /var/

% If desired "shutdown -h now" and create a "postrootmove" snapshot
(after saving snapshot, do reboot to make sure both /mnt/kemptown and
swapspace come up properly; if not, no point in making snapshot)

%% TODO: for me, "shutdown -h now" hangs, so I have to force the
shutdown-- this is probably bad
