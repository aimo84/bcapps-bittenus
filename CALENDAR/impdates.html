Since the early 2000s, it has been regarded as the beginning of the Christmas shopping season in the US, and most major retailers open very early (and more recently during overnight hours) and offer promotional sales. Black Fridays are not federal holidays. Certain states, however, observe this day instead of Columbus Day for employees of the state government.<br>
