% NOTE TO SELF: always boot from "P0" in production, not "P2" ("P2" is
my old fedora install on the big 8TB drive, I want to boot from SSD)

%% TODO: create a dependency tree for RPMs (someone's probably already
done this) or for source code (probably more difficult)

%% TODO (for self): Consider using strong passphrases since I'm
upgrading anyway

%% TODO: give remote machine a name like "dullon" or something so I don't
keep have to say "remote" and "brighton" (+ mention when complete)

%% TODO: add disclaimer re these are my experiences AND you should not
follow instructions blindly AND especially not run commands blindly
AND especially not as root. No intentional malicious code, but blindly
running stuff hurts you and other-- botnet

%% TODO: does keepcache=1 in yum.conf/dnf.conf mean yum/dnf keeps RPMs
around even if I uninstall them? I'd like to minimize external
redundant dls

%% TODO: If I do a minimal install of CentOS (whatever) but using the
7GB (or whatever) image, and then add packages, do those packages come
off the image, or is a minimal install of a 7GB image pretty much a
waste of 6.2 GB?

%% TODO: can rsync move over multiple files to multiple destinations in a single command to avoid pw repeat typing

%% TODO: tweak bc-fake-ntp.pl to print out an "info" message for bg

%% CENTOS INSTALL TIPS (not quite identical to Fedora 24 or CentOS 7)

  - if installing from USB stick, choose "hard drive" and then
  /dev/sdc1 (you cannot pretend the USB stick is a CD/DVD)

  - Basic storage devices

  - Do type in encryption password (as global passphrase), but won't
  actually use it (creating our own new partitions)

  - Fresh Installation ("Upgrade an Existing Installation" won't even
  work because of the symlinks I make)

  - Create Custom Layout

  - Can leave /dev/sda partitions "as is" but do format as ext4 to
  wipe out existing data

  - Choose minimal install, leave CentOS repo as is, do not customize
  (we'll do so after reboot)

NOTE: any reference to "this directory" or "here" refers to
https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/CENTOS/

NOTE: during graphical boot, hit ESC to see what system is actually doing

This document describes my attempt to setup a CentOS-7 system the way
I want it with minimal unnecessary daemons running.

I downloaded and installed
%% TODO: fix this -- I dld's maximal but installed minimal
first

% On dullon (machine from which you are installing), add the machine's
IP address to /etc/hosts something like this:

192.168.0.3 brighton

This will let you refer to the machine as "brighton" instead of having
to type out the IP address each time. Of course, make sure you use the
machine's actual IP address, which probably won't be 192.168.0.3 in
your case.

% "ssh root@brighton" to login remotely as root

% OPTIONAL: If you want to move /home and create swapspace on an
encrypted non-boot drive, see "move-root.txt"

% rsync over BCGIT to brighton, since I will use symlinks to get
things in their proper place

: NOTE: in theory, could use scp which is installed by default, but
: too inefficient if /home/user/ already exists on a separate drive

: if this fails "sudo yum install openssh-clients rsync" on brighton
and then try again

rsync -Pav user@192.168.0.2:/home/barrycarter/BCGIT /home/user/
: and rsync over my private crontab, one of the few files not in this directory
rsync -Pav user@192.168.0.2:/home/barrycarter/bc-private-crontab /home/user/

%% TODO: generalize above for private files in a dir perhaps?

% OPTIONAL: since I install multiple times, move /var/cache to main 8TB
drive that remains unchanged between reinstalls

: if youve done this once, no need to do it again
mkdir -p /mnt/kemptown/var/
sudo mv /var/cache/ /mnt/kemptown/var/

: if youve done this previously youll need to remove the pristine
: /var/cache on every new install
sudo ln -s /mnt/kemptown/var/cache /var/

% Then run the commands in runme.sh

: below SHOULD do everything automatically, but MAY require user intervention

sudo sh -c '/home/user/BCGIT/CENTOS/runme.sh 1>/runme.out 2>/runme.err'&

%% TODO: resume using chkconfig instead of systemctl

% if desired, run "sudo yum -y upgrade", which will upgrade CentOS
itself and many other things; however, it's best to install rpmfusion
packages BEFORE upgrading

% LOOK at /runme.out and /runme.err to see what packages were not
installed, either due to dependencies or because the package was not
available (look for "Skipped (dependency problems):" at the end of
/runme.out)

% These group installs can be done "by hand":

: this lists all groups, even the ones CentOS doesnt "advertise"
yum grouplist hidden

: note my yum install process apparently autoinstalls some groups

: TODO: why are these things groups instead of simple installs?

yum groupinstall "Hardware Monitoring Utilities"

: TODO: below does NOT work, packagelists are empty
: yum groupinstall "MySQL Database client" "MySQL Database server"

yum groupinstall "X Window System"

% I prefer the tcsh for both user and root though some believe this
isn't a good idea (so not putting in runme.sh):

sudo chsh -s /bin/tcsh root
sudo chsh -s /bin/tcsh user

% OPTIONAL: "shutdown -r now" to make sure everything comes up fine

%% TODO: make user member of wheel and passwordless "sudo"

%% TODO: add a "<never>" section to brighton-procs for things I can kill instantly w/o waiting 10m

%% TODO: figure out which packages come from which repos, and see if I
can minimize the number of required repos

%% TODO: linuxtech.com may have an EL/CentOS 7 repo, look into this
(but rpmfusion still doesn't, and linuxtech may not be enough)

%% TODO: make sure screengrab firefox plugin works

%% TODO: attempted kill after boot:

: killing systemd-udevd and systemd-logind works but they come right back
: same with systemd-journald and "agetty"

: TODO: should be able to turn off anacron at a more fundamental level
sudo kill anacron
sudo pkill login
sudo pkill mingetty

%% TODO: setup xinetd properly

%% TODO: currently running "sudo dhclient -d" manually at each reboot, fix

%% TODO: note that yum skips over uninstallable packages, but deal with those

%% TODO: copy notes from FEDORA/README as applicable
