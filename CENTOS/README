I have temporarily (perhaps permanently) given up installing Fedors 24
and am now trying to install CentOS 7. As always, this file will start
with "raw" notes and I'll try to build it into something better later.

cryptsetup open /dev/sdb3 kemptown
: check /etc/cryptsetup first
less /etc/cryptsetup
echo "luks /dev/sdb3 -" > /etc/cryptsetup
: this must be an append, since main drive should appear there first
less /etc/crypttab
blkid | grep /dev/sdb3
echo "luks UUID=the-uuid-given-by-blkid-for-dev-sdb3 none" >> /etc/crypttab
less /etc/fstab
echo "/dev/mapper/oldfedora-home /mnt/kemptown ext4 defaults,x-systemd.device-timeout=30 60 90" >> /etc/fstab
mkdir /mnt/kemptown
mount /mnt/kemptown

% OPTIONAL: move user's home to /mnt/kemptown:

: if below reports "userdel: user user is currently used by process
: xxxx", kill process xxxx (potentially repeatedly) until the command
: succeeds

userdel user;
: below should be VERY minimal
ls -laR /home/user;
rm -rf /home/user;
useradd -d /mnt/kemptown/user -g wheel -u 1000 user
passwd user
ln -s /mnt/kemptown/user /home
: move root over as well
mv /root /root.old
ln -s /mnt/kemptown/root /root

%% TRYING "yum install '*'"
