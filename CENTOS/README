% NOTE TO SELF: always boot from "P0" in production, not "P2" ("P2" is
my old fedora install on the big 8TB drive, I want to boot from SSD)

% NOTE TO SELF: drusillas, hippodrome, camber, and bodiam are
attractions just outside Brighton, in case I want to rename my
external drives and continue the Brighton-based naming scheme

%% TODO: consider virutalization so I can reset to default state w/o
having to reinstall (this might be a little faster?)

%% TODO: resort (or "subroutinize") this file to be in the actual
order I bring things up

%% TODO (for self): consider dropping my personal version of
bc-daemon-checker2.pl since the bc version should now do it all [if
not dropping it, modify it for brighton]

%% TODO (for self): test audio

%% TODO (for self): Consider using strong passphrases since I'm
upgrading anyway

% NOTE: you can sometimes ssh to brighton even before the boot process
has 100% completed; this can be useful if the boot process itself
"hangs"

%% TODO: briefly writeup how to remove multiple boot options CentOS
creates each time it's installed (efibootmgr)

%% TODO: give remote machine a name like "dullon" or something so I don't
keep have to say "remote" and "brighton" (+ mention when complete)

%% TODO: add disclaimer re these are my experiences AND you should not
follow instructions blindly AND especially not run commands blindly
AND especially not as root. No intentional malicious code, but blindly
running stuff hurts you and other-- botnet

%% TODO: does keepcache=1 in yum.conf/dnf.conf mean yum/dnf keeps RPMs
around even if I uninstall them? I'd like to minimize external
redundant dls

%% TODO: If I do a minimal install of CentOS (whatever) but using the
7GB (or whatever) image, and then add packages, do those packages come
off the image, or is a minimal install of a 7GB image pretty much a
waste of 6.2 GB?

%% TODO: can rsync move over multiple files to multiple destinations in a single command to avoid pw repeat typing?

%% TODO: tweak bc-fake-ntp.pl to print out an "info" message for bg

NOTE: during graphical boot, hit ESC to see what system is actually doing

This document describes my attempt to setup a CentOS-7 system the way
I want it with minimal unnecessary daemons running.

I downloaded and installed
%% TODO: fix this -- I dld's maximal but installed minimal
first

% On dullon (machine from which you are installing), add the machine's
IP address to /etc/hosts something like this:

192.168.0.3 brighton

This will let you refer to the machine as "brighton" instead of having
to type out the IP address each time. Of course, make sure you use the
machine's actual IP address, which probably won't be 192.168.0.3 in
your case.

% "ssh root@brighton" to login remotely as root

% OPTIONAL: If you want to move /home and create swapspace on an
encrypted non-boot drive, see "move-root.txt"

% rsync over BCGIT to brighton, since I will use symlinks to get
things in their proper place

: NOTE: in theory, could use scp which is installed by default, but
: too inefficient if /home/user/ already exists on a separate drive

: if this fails "sudo yum install openssh-clients rsync" on brighton
and then try again

rsync -Pav user@192.168.0.2:/home/barrycarter/BCGIT /home/user/
: and rsync over my private crontab, one of the few files not in this directory
rsync -Pav user@192.168.0.2:/home/barrycarter/bc-private-crontab /home/user/

%% TODO: generalize above for private files in a dir perhaps?

% OPTIONAL: since I install multiple times, move /var/cache to main 8TB
drive that remains unchanged between reinstalls

: if youve done this once, no need to do it again
mkdir -p /mnt/kemptown/var/
sudo mv /var/cache/ /mnt/kemptown/var/

: if youve done this previously youll need to remove the pristine
: /var/cache on every new install
sudo ln -s /mnt/kemptown/var/cache /var/

% lets me be barrycarter and user at same time
sudo ln -s /home/user /home/barrycarter

% Install X and other things I want as "groupinstall"

yum grouplist hidden;: lists all available groups
yum groupinstall "Hardware Monitoring Utilities" "X Window System"

% edit SELINUX to disabled and keep cache for yum

printf '1,$s/keepcache=0/keepcache=1/\nwq\n' | ex /etc/yum.conf 
printf '1,$s/SELINUX=enforcing/SELINUX=disabled/\nwq\n'|ex /etc/selinux/config

% OPTIONAL: # if you're using an older .fvwm2rc, this may help -- if
# not, it doesn't hurt (also for some of my programs that use direct
# paths)

sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/X11 /usr/X11R6/
sudo ln -s /usr/libexec/fvwm/2.6.6 /usr/lib/X11/fvwm2
sudo ln -s /bin /usr/X11R6/

% this is so my progs will work correctly

sudo ln -s /home/barrycarter/BCGIT/bclib.pl /usr/local/lib/

% Makes the files in this directory "live"

sudo ln -s /home/user/BCGIT/CENTOS/.xinitrc /home/user/BCGIT/CENTOS/brighton-procs.txt /home/user

% Bootstraps the cron process

sudo crontab -u user /home/user/BCGIT/FEDORA/bc-public-crontab

% Then run the commands in runme.sh

: below SHOULD do everything automatically, but MAY require user intervention

sudo sh -c '/home/user/BCGIT/CENTOS/runme.sh 1>/runme.out 2>/runme.err'&

%% TODO: resume using chkconfig instead of systemctl

% if desired, run "sudo yum -y upgrade", which will upgrade CentOS
itself and many other things; however, it's best to install rpmfusion
packages BEFORE upgrading

% LOOK at /runme.out and /runme.err to see what packages were not
installed, either due to dependencies or because the package was not
available (look for "Skipped (dependency problems):" at the end of
/runme.out)

% These group installs can be done "by hand":

: TODO: why are these things groups instead of simple installs?

% I prefer the tcsh for both user and root though some believe this
isn't a good idea (so not putting in runme.sh):

sudo chsh -s /bin/tcsh root
sudo chsh -s /bin/tcsh user

% OPTIONAL: "shutdown -r now" to make sure everything comes up fine

%% TODO: make user member of wheel and passwordless "sudo"

%% TODO: add a "<never>" section to brighton-procs for things I can kill instantly w/o waiting 10m

%% TODO: figure out which packages come from which repos, and see if I
can minimize the number of required repos

%% TODO: linuxtech.com may have an EL/CentOS 7 repo, look into this
(but rpmfusion still doesn't, and linuxtech may not be enough)

%% TODO: make sure screengrab firefox plugin works

%% TODO: attempted kill after boot:

: killing systemd-udevd and systemd-logind works but they come right back
: same with systemd-journald and "agetty"

: TODO: should be able to turn off anacron at a more fundamental level
sudo kill anacron
sudo pkill login
sudo pkill mingetty

%% TODO: setup xinetd properly

%% TODO: currently running "sudo dhclient -d" manually at each reboot, fix

%% TODO: note that yum skips over uninstallable packages, but deal with those

%% TODO: copy notes from FEDORA/README as applicable
