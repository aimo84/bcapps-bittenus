% If you have an encrypted non-boot drive (I'm naming mine kemptown),
and want to move /home and create swapspace there (approximately),
follow these steps.

% NOTE: If you've previously tried installing centos on this other
drive, your LVMs may have the same name. If so, see
../FEDORA/lvm-name-conflict.txt

% NOTE TO SELF: because I am reinstalling many times, I have scripted
most of the below; scp over script if desired

: initially, there is no "/etc/cryptsetup" and "/etc/crypttab" reads:

: luks-id-of-root-partition UUID=id-of-root-partition none

cryptsetup open /dev/sdb3 kemptown
less /etc/cryptsetup
echo "luks /dev/sdb3 -" > /etc/cryptsetup
less /etc/crypttab
blkid | fgrep /dev/sdb3
: this must be an append, since main drive should appear there first
echo "luks UUID=the-uuid-given-by-blkid-for-dev-sdb3 none" >> /etc/crypttab
less /etc/fstab
echo "/dev/mapper/oldfedora-home /mnt/kemptown ext4 defaults,x-systemd.device-timeout=30 60 90" >> /etc/fstab
mkdir /mnt/kemptown
mount /mnt/kemptown

% create swapspace on /mnt/kemptown/swapspace (TODO: there may be
better ways of doing this but I'm wary of messing w/ my 8TB drive
since I've copied stuff over and made changes)

: only need to do two steps below once
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/kemptown/swap bs=1000000000 count=128 status=progress&
mkswap /mnt/kemptown/swap
: below as recommended
chmod 0600 /mnt/kemptown/swap

less /etc/fstab
echo "/mnt/kemptown/swap swap swap defaults 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
swapon /mnt/kemptown/swap

% OPTIONAL: move user's home to /mnt/kemptown:

: if below reports "userdel: user user is currently used by process
: xxxx", kill process xxxx (potentially repeatedly) until the command
: succeeds

userdel user;
find /home/user -type f
: above should be tiny(ish)
rm -rf /home/user;
useradd -d /mnt/kemptown/user -g wheel -u 1000 user
passwd user
ln -s /mnt/kemptown/user /home
: move root over as well
mv /root /root.old
ln -s /mnt/kemptown/root /root
