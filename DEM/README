If you live in a relatively flat place such as Kansas or the
Australian outback, your horizon is fairly flat and the sun/moon
rise/set times closely match those given in an almanac.

If you live in a hilly or mountainous area (such as Albuquerque, NM,
USA), sun/moon rise/set "over the mountains" can be quite different.

This project uses Digital Elevation Maps (DEMs) to compute the true
horizon at a given location. Notes:

  - The Earth is curved, so the angle subtended by a hill/mountain
  isn't just the arctangent of the elevation difference over the
  distance.

  - Constructing an accurate horizon may require examining a LOT of
  DEM tiles: for example, Mt Taylor, about 90 miles west of
  Albuquerque, affects Albuquerque's horizon.
