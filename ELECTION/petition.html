On November 8th, the majority of Americans voted against Donald Trump.

If it hadn't been for a small minority of third party protest voters,
Hillary Clinton would've won the election.

Those voters are kicking themselves now, because they know, as you
know, and as we all know, that a Trump Presidency means disaster.

In addition to the Presidency, the Republicans control both houses of
Congress AND the President will appoint the next Supreme Court
justice.

We must insure that this President is not Donald Trump.  The last time
a President was elected by a minority, George Bush Jr took office,
resulting in 9/11.

Fortunately, there's something even more powerful than an egotistical
maniac: the Constitution of the United States of America, which states:

<blockquote>  
  Each State shall appoint, <b>in such Manner as the Legislature thereof
may direct</b>, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of
Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the
Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an
Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed
an Elector.
</blockquote>

In other words, a state legislature does not have an obligation to
appoint electors based on the popular plurality vote, even if an
election has already been held.

Call, visit, write, or email your state legislators (and maybe those
of other states). See http://removetrumpnow.com/ for a sample letter
and some notes.

Note there are 6 states in particular where the majority voted against
Trump, and Trump only won by a small plurality due to third party
voters:<ul>

<li>Florida (29 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 128,503 votes, and
there were 293,802 votes for third party candidates. If 43.74% of them
had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

<li>Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 68,012 votes,
and there were 212,508 votes for third party candidates. If 32.00% of
them had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

<li>Michigan (16 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 17,386 votes, and
there were 241,125 votes for third party candidates. If 7.21% of them
had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

<li>Arizona (11 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 81,607 votes, and
there were 94,917 votes for third party candidates. If 85.98% of them
had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

<li>Wisconsin (10 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 26,889 votes, and
there were 152,773 votes for third party candidates. If 17.60% of them
had voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

<li>Utah (6 electoral votes): Clinton lost by 125,851 votes, and there
were 192,096 votes for third party candidates. If 65.51% of them had
voted for Clinton, Clinton would've won.</li><p>

</ul>

Of these, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin have the closest
margins, and the 46 electoral votes they could provide would be enough
to change the election results. If you're going to contact only three
states, these would be the ones. Of course, if you want to contact
more states (perhaps all 26 which "chose" Trump), that's even better.
