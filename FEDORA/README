https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/FEDORA/

NOTE: the "local" machine is the one to which you are installing
Fedora 24; the "remote" machine is any Linux machine from which you
are performing the install.

NOTE: I will sometimes refer to "Fedora 24" as "Fedora Core 24"
because many of the package names still have "fc24" in them.

reinstalls to test final file]

all filechanging processes have been stopped forever

%% TODO: perhaps do systemctl disables post dnf installs

%% TODO: move files in this directory to the proper places on brighton
(or symlink)

This document describes how I (mostly remotely) created a minimal
Fedora Core 24 system (no gnome, no evolution, no unnecessary daemons)
running fvwm2

I assume that you have downloaded Fedora Core 24 from
https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/ burned and booted from
the DVD image, and clicked "Install" to install Fedora Core 24 on your
hard disk with a root password and one other user whois is an
administrator and has a password. I will refer to this user as "user"
in this document.

OPTIONAL: if you are installing Fedora to a solid-state drive (SSD),
and want the /home and /root directories on another drive, partition
as follows:

  - Set the /home partition to 5GiB. We will symlink to the remote
  drive later.

  - Set the swap partition to the size of your memory; ideally, double
  the size of your memory if you have it (but see below)

  - Leave the /boot and /boot/efi partitions as is.

  - Give the remaining space to the / partition, but leave at least
  20GiB: you probably won't need it, but the dnf installs below total
  ~9GiB, so you just might if you install even more stuff.

OPTIONAL: You make want to create a trivial "fake" user (username:
fake) with a trivial password (password: "abc123") during installation
and then create a "real" user later on, especially if you want the
real user's home directory to be on a different drive. Note that:

  - You can create a "fake" user with a weak password only during the
  installation phase (you to confirm the weak password, but it's still
  possible).

  - Do make the "fake" user an administrator (ie, a member of the
  group 'wheel'), because you will need to "sudo su" from it if you're
  creating the real user's home directory on a different partition.

  - Use "Advanced" to give the "fake" user an id "2001" or something
  other than the default; you will want your main user to have user id
  1001.

  - If you choose not to create a user at all, you will be required to
  create one when Fedora first starts up. In this case, however, it
  will be impossible to use a weak password.

  - If you create a "fake" user with no password, you will have
  difficulty using "ssh", since "ssh"ing to a passwordless account
  requires tweaking /etc/sshd_config

  - If you want to ssh directly to the "root" user, you will also need to tweak /etc/sshd_config

After removing the installation media and rebooting, login as
user. You will now be in the GNOME environment. Now:

% Go to the top right of the screen, click the down arrow, and choose
the settings icon at the bottom left of the pulldown menu.

% Select "Sharing", and turn on Sharing in general and "Remote Login"
specifically.

% Logout by clicking the down arrow again, choosing your user name,
and clicking Logout. From now on, we will be working remotely.

% On your local machine (not the one on which you're installing Fedora
Core 24), add the machine's IP address to /etc/hosts something like
this:

192.168.0.3 brighton

This will let you refer to the machine as "brighton" instead of having
to type out the IP address each time. Of course, make sure you use the
machine's actual IP address, which probably won't be 192.168.0.3 in
your case.

% "ssh user@brighton" to login remotely (or "ssh fake@brighton" to
create a new user with a home directory on a different drive)

% "sudo su" to become root

% do this so you can become root passwordlessly (we will need this later):

echo "%wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" > /etc/sudoers.d/wheel

% If desired, edit /boot/efi/EFI/fedora/grub.cfg and remove "rhgb
quiet" whereever they occur (rhgb = red hat graphical boot). This way,
you can see what the system is doing when it starts up.

% OPTIONAL: to move home directories to a bigger drive, run commands
similar to the following (your big drive partition may vary):

: my large drive is hereby dubbed "kemptown"
cryptsetup open /dev/sdb3 kemptown

: /dev/sdb[12] are small partitions that I will ignore

: because I installed Fedora on kemptown first, I have this issue:

# lvscan 
  ACTIVE            '/dev/fedora/root' [45.10 GiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/fedora/home' [2.00 GiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/fedora/swap' [64.00 GiB] inherit
  inactive          '/dev/fedora/swap' [30.56 GiB] inherit
  inactive          '/dev/fedora/home' [7.20 TiB] inherit
  inactive          '/dev/fedora/root' [50.00 GiB] inherit

Namely, I have identical LVM names on two drives. I can use lvrename
to fix, but:

# lvrename /dev/fedora/home /dev/fedora/althome
  Multiple VGs found with the same name: skipping fedora
  Use the VG UUID with --select vg_uuid=<uuid>

Thus, I used "vgdisplay" to get the correct device, but the "--select"
option does not actually exist for lvrename. However:

vgrename my-vg-id /dev/oldfedora

does work.

: this activates the 3 volumes now on /dev/oldfedora

vgchange -ay

mkdir /mnt/kemptown
mount /dev/mapper/oldfedora-home /mnt/kemptown

: create the "real" user with a home directory on /mnt/kemptown/user

useradd -d /mnt/kemptown/user -g wheel -u 1000 user
passwd user

% To get /mnt/kemptown booting automatically:

echo "luks /dev/sdb3 -" >> /etc/cryptsetup
echo "/dev/mapper/oldfedora-home /mnt/kemptown ext4" >> /etc/fstab

% You can now move /root/ safely

mv /root /root.old;
ln -s /mnt/kemptown/root /root

% this symlink let's me actually install as /home/user but still "be"
barrycarter

sudo ln -s /home/user /home/barrycarter


% This dnf command removes pretty much everything that can safely be
removed (you may see some harmless errors).

sudo dnf remove audit gssproxy alsa-utils 'gvfs*' rtkit "gnome*" "evolution*"

% Put the .xinitrc, startup-nox.sh, and startup-x.sh files in this
directory in ~user, and, if desired, the systemctl-disable.sh and
dnf-installs.sh scripts into /tmp/

% reboot to bring up the system without these daemons running (you
will need to go local to boot "fedora" (not recovery mode) and type in
your disk encryption password

shutdown -r now

% you will come up a "localhost login" or similar prompt, not a
windows environment (you don't actually need to login locally)

% Remotely, "ssh user@brighton" and "sudo su" again (even if you used
"fake@brighton" earlier, you should use "user@brighton" from now on)

% There are still several daemons running but we can stop and disable
them with systemctl

% INFO: you can use the following to see which services are still running:

systemctl -t service | egrep 'loaded +active +running'

% To disable and stop most of these services:

systemctl disable abrtd abrt-oops abrt-xorg avahi-daemon chronyd firewalld mcelog ModemManager NetworkManager-dispatcher rngd systemd-udevd systemd-logind systemd-journald avahi-daemon.socket systemd-udevd-control.socket systemd-udevd-kernel.socket systemd-journald.socket systemd-journald-audit.socket systemd-journald-dev-log.socket udisks2

% Run the above command again, but replacing "disable" with "stop":

systemctl stop abrtd abrt-oops abrt-xorg avahi-daemon chronyd firewalld mcelog ModemManager NetworkManager-dispatcher rngd systemd-udevd systemd-logind systemd-journald avahi-daemon.socket systemd-udevd-control.socket systemd-udevd-kernel.socket systemd-journald.socket systemd-journald-audit.socket systemd-journald-dev-log.socket udisks2

% NOTE: do NOT try to disable (or remove the packages that contain)
any of: "dbus", "lvm2-lvmetad", "polkit", "getty",
"user@*.service". Doing so may break things severely.

% stop selinux by editing "SELINUX=enforcing" to "SELINUX=disabled" in
/etc/selinux/config as root (changes will take place on next reboot)

% INFO: use "ps -ef | fgrep -v '['" to see the few remaining
(nonbracketed) processes. You CANNOT safely kill or remove any of these
(including "(sd-pam)")

% reboot again to make sure the system comes up cleanly ("shutdown -r
now"); as before, you will have to choose to boot into regular fedora
and type in your disk encryption password.

% then, remotely "ssh user@brighton" and then "sudo su" again

%% TODO: right now, to get user's home directory back, you must:

sudo cryptsetup open /dev/sdb3 kemptown
sudo mount /dev/mapper/oldfedora-home /mnt/kemptown

I need to improve this process.

% You can now install many things remotely (or locally), including
fvwm2 (note that this will reinstall SOME of what we uninstalled
earlier, but only a minimal acceptable subset)

: we first install a couple of repos
