I ran these commands after installing the OS, logging in as root
(using the graphical interface), clicking through all the welcome
screens, turning on remote sharing and closing the "remote sharing"
windows.

%% TODO: since some of these commands may contain private information,
I am putting them in /home/barrycarter/20161125 for now; prune them
and copy the output here as a file

ps -wwwef > /tmp/ps.txt

systemctl list-unit-files > /tmp/systemctl-list-unit-files.txt
chkconfig 1> /tmp/chkconfig.out 2> /tmp/chkconfig.err
service --status-all > /tmp/service-status-all.txt

: and rsync above to remote machine

%% another fresh install at 20161125.233006

systemctl -t service | grep 'running' | perl -anle 'print "systemctl stop $F[0]; systemctl disable $F[0]"'

: these 3 services wont die

systemctl stop auditd.service; systemctl disable auditd.service;
systemctl stop dbus.service; systemctl disable dbus.service;
systemctl stop systemd-journald.service; systemctl disable systemd-journald.service;

: changed /etc/selinux/config, now rebooting

: had to restore sshd and NetworkManager

: to get rid of polkit disable first, then stop

systemctl -t service | grep 'running' | perl -anle 'print "systemctl disable $F[0]; systemctl stop $F[0]"'
