% If you installed Fedora on kemptown (other drive) first, you may
have this issue:

# lvscan 
  ACTIVE            '/dev/fedora/root' [45.10 GiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/fedora/home' [2.00 GiB] inherit
  ACTIVE            '/dev/fedora/swap' [64.00 GiB] inherit
  inactive          '/dev/fedora/swap' [30.56 GiB] inherit
  inactive          '/dev/fedora/home' [7.20 TiB] inherit
  inactive          '/dev/fedora/root' [50.00 GiB] inherit

Namely, I have identical LVM names on two drives. I can use lvrename
to fix, but:

# lvrename /dev/fedora/home /dev/fedora/althome

  Multiple VGs found with the same name: skipping fedora
  Use the VG UUID with --select vg_uuid=<uuid>

Thus, I used "vgdisplay" to get the correct device, but the "--select"
option does not actually exist for lvrename. However:

vgrename my-vg-id /dev/oldfedora

does work.

: this activates the 3 volumes now on /dev/oldfedora

vgchange -ay

mkdir /mnt/kemptown
mount /dev/mapper/oldfedora-home /mnt/kemptown
