# I learned a lot -- well sort of -- about systemctl while trying to
# minimize what daemons run. This file sorta summarizes it

# turn off auditd
auditd -s disable


: for testing, this attempts to disable ALL systemctl services that
: are active; it will fail for audit.service which cannot be turned off

systemctl -t service|grep 'running'| perl -anle 'print "systemctl stop $F[0]; systemctl disable $F[0]"' | sh

: this disables the journalling service for good

systemctl stop systemd-journald-dev-log.socket systemd-journald-audit.socket systemd-journald.socket dbus.socket
systemctl disable systemd-journald-dev-log.socket systemd-journald-audit.socket systemd-journald.socket dbus.socket
