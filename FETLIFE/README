Creating new directory for FetLife related code

Canon order (I hope to establish):

id,screenname,age,gender,role,city,state,country,source,mtime

Fields in both (renaming scrape_time to mtime):

id,screenname,thumbnail,age,gender,role,mtime

Fields only in location sucking:

loc1,loc2,page_number

Fields only in user sucking:

latestactivity,npics,nvids,nfriends,cities,administrative_areas,countries

Extra data from user sucking (not really fields):

events,groups,fetish,islookingfor,relationshipstatus,dsrelationshipstatus
