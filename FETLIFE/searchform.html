<!-- TODO LIST:

emphasize no FL affiliation

create static queries to sort role/gender/etc by number of users
(GROUP BY) and link to form:

Genders:
http://4e7541f44c65b198855163f4806ca243.fetlife.db.94y.info/

Roles:
http://26786bbe4823b71afa24fbbd7e6951b1.fetlife.db.94y.info/

Ages:
http://85b090dd07451a14eaf69ec083fea479.fetlife.db.94y.info/

Gender/Roles: [this times out]

Countries:
http://b754f578b06eea176e8c2795eb5eaf35.fetlife.db.94y.info/

note no search-by-orientation

provide list of admin areas per country perhaps using group_concat (or list?)

add legal disclaimer re transformative work

add limit (allow limitless queries but warn re time out)

create a name for "jump to instructions" after form

add "this is experimental" disclaimer

if it's easier, MIME encode query before posting to form, but make sure bc-run-query can handle data that way [and that it doesn't defeat any safety checks]

allow multiple cities/states separated by commas (and handle correctly
on bc-fl-search.pl)

use thumbs view (not main table) I created

mention kinksters table for those who want to go "raw"

once user has chose specific values, make those values "sticky"

current db has a header line that I need to delete on next update
