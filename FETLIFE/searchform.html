<h1>FetLife Search Form (not affiliated with FetLife)</h1>

<form action="" method="POST"><table border>

<tr><th>Gender</th><td>SELECT GOES HERE</td></tr>

<!-- TODO LIST:

emphasize no FL affiliation

create fixed queries to sort role/gender/etc by number of users
(GROUP BY) and link to form

note no search-by-orientation

provide list of admin areas per country perhaps using group_concat (or list?)

add legal disclaimer re transformative work

add limit (allow limitless queries but warn re time out)

create a name for "jump to instructions" after form

add "this is experimental" disclaimer

if it's easier, MIME encode query before posting to form, but make sure bc-run-query can handle data that way [and that it doesn't defeat any safety checks]
