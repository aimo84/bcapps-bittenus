<h4>Notes</h4>

This form provides limited access to the unofficial and experimental
FetLife user database.

<p>

If you know SQL well, you can access the full database at <a
href="http://shared.db.mysql.94y.info/">http://shared.db.mysql.94y.info/</a>.
The database has no instructions, so, if you don't know SQL (MySQL
engine) well, this won't be very useful.

<p>

When you click "view results", the bottom of the results page will
show the query that created your results. If you know SQL moderately
well, you can modify this query to refine your results.

<p>

The default search is limited to 200 rows. You can remove this limitation on the results page by removing "LIMIT 200" from the query. However...

<p>

Queries are limited to 5 seconds of CPU time (which can be more than 5
seconds of clock time). If your results time out repeatedly (or you
run into any other problems), please feel free to contact me at
openfetlife@mail.com

<p>

The popnum and popnumtotal fields indicate roughly how active a user
is (lower popnum numbers = more active), but do not rely too heavily
on these fields.

<p>

The full table (4 million plus rows) is available at <a
href="http://test.94y.info/FETLIFE/">http://test.94y.info/FETLIFE/</a>

<p>

You can also visit the links above for more details on the database,
and what each field means, along with additional disclaimers.

<p>

Because of the way this database is generated, you can unfortunately
not search by orientation.

<p>

Do not rely on this information. This information was obtained
legally, and falls under the Fair Use doctorine of copyright law.<p>

More specifically, FetLife search engines are explicitly legal beause
they meet the Fair Use criteria known as "transformative use":<p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformativeness">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformativeness</a><p>

because they "provide the public with a benefit not previously
available to it, which would otherwise remain unavailable", and "in a
different manner or for a different purpose".

<!-- TODO LIST:

add magnet link?

provide list of admin areas per country perhaps using group_concat (or list?)

allow multiple cities/states separated by commas (and handle correctly
on bc-fl-search.pl)

case-insensitive sort of roles? (or do lower case = new roles = things I want to keep lower on the list?)

-->
