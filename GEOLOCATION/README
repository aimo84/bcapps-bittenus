An attempt to geolocate IP addresses/hostnames, based on:

  - The hostname itself

  - The WHOIS or rr.arin.net records

  - DNS LOC

samplehosts*: some of these files were obtained by running various
mtr's on various hosts (including my attempt to hit one IP in every
"class C" network) [some runs are still in progress, so
samplehosts4.txt will change somewhat during early April 2012]

TODO: sometimes I can decode using IP, not hostname, so should store
all IPs, even those for which I already have hostnames

Files in this directory:

samplehosts4.txt: a large list of hosts I found while mtr'ing to
x.y.z.r for all possible values of x/y/z (0..255), and randomly chosen
r for each x/y/z, along with number of times the host was 'hit' during
the mtr's. Since all mtr's were run from a single machine, there is a
bias towards hosts 'near' the source machine.

samplehosts*.txt: currently ignored (samplehosts4.txt has pretty much
everything)

sortedhosts.txt: list of all hosts sorted by tld.2ld.3ld..., with
frequencies ignored

sortedips.txt: list of all IP addresses (where there was no hostname)
sorted by most signifigant octet

hostfreq.txt: the TLD, 2LD, 3LD, etc of hosts that match no pattern in
regexp.txt; identifies where we should focus our efforts

ipfreq.txt: identifies which netblocks have the most unresolved IP
addresses; currently not used for much beyond that

resolvedhosts.txt: list of hosts that match some regexp in regexp.txt,
and the code extracted from the matching regexp

unresolvedhosts.txt: list of hosts that match no regexp in regexp.txt

codelist.txt: list of extracted codes from hosts that match patterns
in regexp.txt

codes-by-big-cities.txt: locations for codes, as determined
automatically; not always accurate
