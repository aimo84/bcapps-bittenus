   - I'D HAVE TO SAY NOBODY.
      I THINK I GET ALONG
     WITH ALL HER FRIENDS.

      ARE REALLY ANNOYING.

    THEY'RE NEVER A PROBLEM.
          THEY JUST--
   THEY'RE KIND OF LAID-BACK.
          SO I'D HAVE

        TO YOUR HUSBAND,

   IF YOU WENT TO A PSYCHIC,
    WHAT IS THE FIRST THING
          HE SAID YOU
        WOULD ASK ABOUT?

            - WELL,
     WE ALREADY KNOW THAT.
           [laughter]

       - IT'S ALWAYS GOOD
        TO DOUBLE-CHECK.
    - ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT DO YOU SAY, STACEY?

         - THE BABIES.
    HOW MANY CHILDREN, HUH?
       - THE BABIES, YEP.
            BABIES.

         I COULD HAVE--
          - ALL RIGHT.

  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
  LADIES, HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
     FINISH THIS SENTENCE?
  MY WORST NIGHTMARE WOULD BE
   TO SPEND A NIGHT OUT ALONE

          WITH MY WIFE
     AND HER FRIEND BLANK.
        ALL RIGHT, WE'RE
    GONNA START WITH STACEY.
     - IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
        MY SISTER LISA.

          - WHY LISA?
       - UM, WHEN YOU PUT
    THE TWO OF US TOGETHER,
 WE CREATE THIS CRAZY FIREWORK,
        AND IT'S SCARY.

           [laughter]
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?
             LISA!
           - GOT IT.

           [applause]
      - ALL RIGHT, ARIANA.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
       MY COUSIN TIFFANY,

            BECAUSE
      WE'RE A LITTLE NUTS.
     AND WE GET TO GABBIN',
    AND IT JUST NEVER ENDS.
   SO HE WOULD BE SICK OF IT.

  - TIFFANY WOULD BE THE ONE.
    KALE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
             ABBY.

            - ABBY?
    - ABBY! I LOVE TIFFANY.
        DON'T SAY THAT.
      - HE LOVES TIFFANY.
      NOW, HOWEVER, ABBY--
THIRD WHEEL THAT WON'T GO AWAY.

          - YES, ABBY.
             ABBY.
       - THAT'S MY LOVE.
             - SEE?
      - THAT'S YOUR LOVE,
    BUT NOT HIS LOVE, GIRL.

          YEAH, ABBY.
   I DON'T THINK ABBY WILL BE
  COMING AROUND, AFTER WHAT--
        - SHE'S COMING.
    - AFTER WHAT KALE SAID.

             WHOO.
       ALL RIGHT, NICOLE.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - I'D DEFINITELY
 HAVE TO SAY MY SISTER KRISTIN,

BECAUSE WHENEVER WE'RE TOGETHER
      I ALWAYS IGNORE JAY,
        AND I DON'T PAY
     ANY ATTENTION TO HIM,
'CAUSE WE'RE, LIKE, INSEPARABLE
