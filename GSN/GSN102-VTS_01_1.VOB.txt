      WHILE YOUR CLASSMATE'S
      LOCKING IN HIS ANSWER,
         LET ME TELL YOU
        HOW THEY CAN HELP.
          YOU CAN CHEAT
        OFF OF THEM TWICE.

      ONCE DURING THE GAME,
   YOU MAY PEEK AT THEIR PAPER.
    IF YOU LIKE THEIR ANSWER,
       YOU CAN GO WITH IT.
  IF YOU'D RATHER USE YOUR OWN,
         YOU CAN DO THAT.

      AND YOU CAN COPY ONCE
         DURING THE GAME,
         MEANING YOU CAN
        COPY THEIR ANSWER,
   BUT YOU MUST TAKE THE ANSWER
   THAT THEY HAVE WRITTEN DOWN.

      ONCE DURING THE GAME,
       YOU CAN USE A SAVE,
           WHICH MEANS
    IF YOU ANSWER INCORRECTLY
        BUT YOUR CLASSMATE
        ANSWERS CORRECTLY,

        THEY CAN SAVE YOU.
YOU CAN CONTINUE ON IN THE GAME.

   QUESTION IS MULTIPLE CHOICE.

            ON SOMEONE
         THAT MIGHT HAVE

         ALL RIGHT, PAT.
        YOU WANTED TO COPY
  YOUR CLASSMATE KYLE'S ANSWER.
    "WHAT IS THE LOWEST LAYER
   OF THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE?"

           KYLE SAID...
       "B" -- THERMOSPHERE.

          IT'S NOT "A."
      IT'S NOT "MESOSPHERE."

      IT'S NOT "B," EITHER.

THAT'S WHAT I'M THINKING.
   USUALLY, IF YOU'RE CHEATING
      ON THE FIRST QUESTION,

    YOU'RE NOT REALLY THINKING

  YOU REALLY THINK YOU DESERVE
  TO SKIP A COUPLE OF GRADES?

         YOU GOT $1,000.
 LET'S SEE YOUR $2,000 QUESTION.

       4th GRADE ASTRONOMY.
        THE QUESTION IS...
       "NOT COUNTING PLUTO,
  HOW MANY PLANETS IN OUR SOLAR
 SYSTEM ARE SMALLER THAN EARTH?"

       YOUR CLASSMATE ALANA
          HAS LOCKED IN.
 I KNOW THAT WE HAVE
    NINE PLANETS,
AND PLUTO IS ONE OF THEM.

  THAT COUNTS NINE,
SO THAT'S EIGHT PLANETS.
      "NOT COUNTING PLUTO."
SO THAT LEAVES EIGHT.

AND I KNOW TWO OF THEM ARE
DEFINITELY BIGGER THAN EARTH.
     OH, MY GOD.
        ALANA.

              I CAN'T HELP YOU.
   SHE CAN'T HELP YOU UNLESS
   YOU WANT TO USE YOUR COPY.
OKAY. WE'VE GOT MERCURY
      AND MARS,

   AND I THINK MARS
     IS SMALLER.
 THEN WE HAVE SATURN
     AND JUPITER,
AND I THINK SATURN AND JUPITER
     ARE BIGGER.

 THEN WE HAVE URANUS
     AND NEPTUNE,
WHICH I KNOW FOR A FACT
     ARE SMALLER.
         OH!

        I KNOW THE ANSWER,
       AND YOU'RE MAKING ME
       SECOND-GUESS MYSELF.

I FEEL LIKE I EITHER HAVE IT
     OR I DON'T.
AND I FEEL LIKE I DON'T.
SO, I AM GOING TO COPY
     FROM ALANA.

    GONNA COPY ALANA'S PAPER.
  SHIELA, IF YOU'D HAD TO GUESS,
    WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID?
  IF I HAD GUESSED,
I WOULD HAVE SAID THREE.

   IF YOU'D HAVE SAID THREE,
   YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN RIGHT,
      AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
        BURNED YOUR COPY.
       "NOT COUNTING PLUTO,

  HOW MANY PLANETS IN OUR SOLAR
 SYSTEM ARE SMALLER THAN EARTH?"
         YOU BETTER HOPE
    ALANA WROTE DOWN "THREE."
 FOR $2,000, MAY WE PLEASE SEE
WHAT THIS 5th GRADER WROTE DOWN?

         YOU HAVE $2,000.
    SHIELA, THE THREE PLANETS
  ARE VENUS, MERCURY, AND MARS.
            ALL RIGHT.

  YOUR CLASSMATES CAN ONLY HELP
   YOU TWO QUESTIONS AT A TIME.
         GOOD JOB, ALANA.

   SOME FAMILY WITH YOU TODAY.
