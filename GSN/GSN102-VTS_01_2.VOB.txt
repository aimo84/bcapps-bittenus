         IF, AT ANY POINT
         DURING THE GAME,

     THE PRESSURE GETS TO BE
            TOO MUCH,
   YOU CAN DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.
  YOU CAN TAKE THE MONEY THAT
YOU'VE BANKROLLED TO THAT POINT,

     YOU CAN HIT THE BUTTON,
         BUT WHEN YOU DO,
      YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME
    YOU'LL LOOK IN THE CAMERA

  AND TELL EVERYBODY, "I AM NOT
   SMARTER THAN A 5th GRADER."
     OH, MY GOD.
      I PROMISE.
        DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

    ABSOLUTE DEAL.
         ALL RIGHT, ROY.
        LET'S FIND OUT --
         ARE YOU SMARTER
        THAN A 5th GRADER?

           LET'S PLAY.
   ALL RIGHT. WHOO!
         ALL RIGHT, ROY,
         PICK A SUBJECT.

KYLE, WE'RE GONNA TAKE
 1st GRADE ASTRONOMY.
     IT'S WORTH $1,000, ROY.
       HERE'S THE QUESTION.
         "TRUE OR FALSE?

  YOU CAN SEE THE PLANET SATURN
       WITH THE NAKED EYE."
        KYLE HAS LOCKED IN
           HIS ANSWER.
        WHEW.

      WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,
               ROY?
         50-50 CHANCE --
          TRUE OR FALSE.
 SATURN'S FAIRLY BIG,
BUT PRETTY MUCH OUT THERE.

I KNOW YOU CAN SEE VENUS
 WITH THE NAKED EYE,
BUT SATURN AND JUPITER --
 THAT'S A LITTLE FAR.
 I WOULD LIKE TO USE
      THE PEEK.

         YOU WANT TO PEEK
        AT KYLE'S ANSWER.
    YOU WANT TO LOCK THAT IN?
         YAY!

         "TRUE OR FALSE?
  YOU CAN SEE THE PLANET SATURN
       WITH THE NAKED EYE."
   KYLE, A 10-YEAR-OLD, SAID...

        OKAY.
           WHAT'S YOUR
        GUT INSTINCT, ROY?
   MY GUT INSTINCT
IS THAT I CAN SEE IT.

  IT'S A BIG PLANET.
YOU CAN SEE JUPITER --
I MEAN, VENUS ON A GOOD NIGHT.
     YOU CAN SEE VENUS NAKED
         ON A GOOD NIGHT.

        NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
   ON A GOOD NIGHT, YOU CAN SEE
    VENUS WITH THE NAKED EYE.
            I'M SORRY.
  I MESSED THAT WHOLE THING UP.

    YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK IT'S BIG ENOUGH
 THAT YOU CAN SEE IT
 WITH THE NAKED EYE,

SO I AM GOING TO PICK...
        TRUE.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

        KYLE SAID "FALSE."
   IF YOU HAD DEPENDED ON KYLE,
       YOU'D BE GOING HOME

      BECAUSE YOU ARE RIGHT.
        YOU'VE GOT $1,000.

      "THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER
 HAS HOW MANY FEDERAL HOLIDAYS?"

        KYLE HAS LOCKED IN

THAT IT ONLY HAS ONE...

   FEDERAL HOLIDAY.

     AND THE "SOMETHING ELSE"
         IS VETERANS DAY.

      OH, OKAY.

       3rd GRADE ASTRONOMY.
         ALL RIGHT, TIM,
   HERE'S THE $5,000 QUESTION.

        ALPHER -- ALPHER?
   "ALPHER" -- THAT WOULD BE
   THE GEORGIA PRONUNCIATION.
  YOUR CLASSMATE KYLE HAS LOCKED
      IN HIS ANSWER ALREADY.

      WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
         DID ANYTHING --
 YEAH, ALPHA CENTAURI
KIND OF COMES TO MIND
JUST BECAUSE IT'S ALPHA.

  IT'S KIND OF LIKE
THE LEADER OF THE PACK.
THE NORTH STAR, A BIG ONE.
YOU CAN SEE IT IN THE SKY.

BUT MAYBE IT'S POLARIS.
THAT'S A REAL POPULAR-SOUNDING
   NAME FOR A STAR.
        YOU SEEM CONFUSED.

    LET ME REMIND YOU HOW YOUR
     CLASSMATES CAN HELP YOU.
    YOU CAN CHEAT OFF OF THEM
      TWICE DURING THE GAME.
        ONCE YOU MAY PEEK
         AT THEIR PAPER,

     WHICH MEANS YOU MAY SEE
          THEIR ANSWER.
         IF YOU LIKE IT,
         YOU CAN USE IT.
          IF YOU DON'T,
    YOU CAN GO WITH YOUR OWN.

   ONCE DURING THE GAME YOU MAY
   COPY YOUR CLASSMATE'S PAPER.
         BUT IF YOU COPY,
   YOU MUST GO WITH THE ANSWER
  THEY HAVE WRITTEN DOWN, OKAY?

     AND ONCE DURING THE GAME
        THEY CAN SAVE YOU,
  WHICH MEANS IF YOU WRITE DOWN
        THE WRONG ANSWER,
BUT YOUR CLASSMATE AT THE PODIUM
 HAS WRITTEN THE RIGHT ANSWER,

          THEY SAVE YOU.
        YOU WIN THE MONEY.
   YOU CONTINUE ON IN THE GAME.
            ALL RIGHT.

       SO, HOW YOU FEELING
         ABOUT THIS ONE?
        YEAH.
I'M THINKING THAT I MAY NEED
  TO CHEAT ON THIS.

    ASTRONOMY WAS
NOT ONE OF MY SUBJECTS.
        YES, WE KNOW, TIM.

    OTHER THAN SOCIAL STUDIES

          YOU'RE WRONG.
       [ AUDIENCE GROANS ]

         KYLE IS RIGHT...
      AND YOU HAVE $10,000.
    I GOT TO STAY?

        YOU'VE BEEN SAVED
        BY A 10-YEAR-OLD.
   SUMMER TAKES PLACE ENTIRELY
  DURING DAYLIGHT SAVINGS TIME.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

         OOH!
     THAT'S A NICE JOB, KYLE.
       YOU'VE GOT $10,000.

   YOU'RE PLAYING FOR $25,000.
  YOU ONLY HAVE ONE CHEAT LEFT.
     PICK ANOTHER CLASSMATE.

     NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
     THE REST OF THE GAME,
        THE MINIMUM AMOUNT
  YOU CAN LEAVE WITH IS $25,000.

        2nd GRADE HEALTH.
   TRACY, YOUR $25,000 QUESTION

             YOU HAVE
      HOW MANY KIDS -- FOUR?
     YEAH, I DO.
    YOU'VE LIVED THROUGH THIS.

I DON'T THINK I EVER SAT DOWN
AND ACTUALLY COUNTED THEM ALL.
          YOUR CLASSMATE
    HAS LOCKED IN HER ANSWER.
     OKAY. OKAY.

     I HAVE TO...
       HOLD ON.

        TRACY, YOU'VE GOT
    A LITTLE SOMETHING THERE.

  I THINK I GOT IT.
      [ LAUGHS ]
        OKAY.
 I -- I THINK IT'S --

        YOU CAN DROP OUT.
I'M NOT DROPPING OUT.
              OKAY.

      YOU'RE BASING $10,000
         ON YOUR FINGERS
       BEING IN YOUR MOUTH.
       I'M NOT.

      OH, UM...
             YOU KNOW
      YOU HAVE A CHEAT LEFT.
   YOU CAN COPY LAURA'S PAPER.

        I DO,
AND I FEEL LIKE DOING THAT.
        OKAY.
   OH, GOSH. OKAY.

       I THINK
I'M GOING TO COPY LAURA.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
     I'M PUTTING
   MY FAITH IN HER,

PUTTING MY FAITH IN HER.
  YOU'RE PUTTING ALL YOUR FAITH
        IN A 10-YEAR-OLD.
  I WANT TO GET OVER
    THE LUMP HERE.

    WE'RE GONNA REVEAL WHETHER
     THAT WAS A WISE DECISION
       AND YOU HAVE $25,000
       OR YOU'RE GOING HOME
         WITH NOTHING...

        RIGHT AFTER THIS.
   I'M SO NERVOUS!
