     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

    SHE HAS PUT ALL HER FAITH

   WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE GUESSED?

THAT IT WAS, "B," 24.

YOU HAVE NO MORE CHEATS LEFT.

         DURING THE GAME,

        COPY THEIR ANSWER,

   THAT THEY HAVE WRITTEN DOWN.

    "WHAT IS THE LOWEST LAYER
   OF THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE?"

           KYLE SAID...
       "B" -- THERMOSPHERE.
      ALL RIGHT.

       I'LL TELL YOU THIS.
          IT'S NOT "A."
      IT'S NOT "MESOSPHERE."
         THE BAD NEWS IS,
      IT'S NOT "B," EITHER.

        PAT, IT IS "C" --
           TROPOSPHERE.
          I AM SO SORRY.

A PROPER NOUN, CAPITALIZED.
"OPRAH" -- I WANT TO SAY
