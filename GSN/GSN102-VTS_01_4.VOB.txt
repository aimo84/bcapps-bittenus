     MORE SERIOUS...

   LIKE ACID REFLUX DISEASE.

 FOR MANY, PRESCRIPTION NEXIUM
   NOT ONLY PROVIDES 24-HOUR

  OTHER SERIOUS STOMACH

I REMEMBER THE DAYS BEFORE COPD.
          MY SON AND I
    NEVER MISSED OPENING DAY.
          BUT WITH COPD
   MAKING IT HARD TO BREATHE,

            I THOUGHT
    THOSE DAYS MIGHT BE OVER.
     SO MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED
           SYMBICORT.
 IT HELPS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE
        MY LUNG FUNCTION,

   STARTING WITHIN 5 MINUTES.
    SYMBICORT DOESN'T REPLACE
        A RESCUE INHALER
      FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.

         WITH SYMBICORT,
   TODAY I'M BREATHING BETTER,
        AND THAT MEANS...
      GAME ON!

     SYMBICORT IS FOR COPD,
  INCLUDING CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
         AND EMPHYSEMA.
     IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN
     MORE THAN TWICE A DAY.

     SYMBICORT MAY INCREASE
  YOUR RISK OF LUNG INFECTIONS,
          OSTEOPOROSIS,
     AND SOME EYE PROBLEMS.
        TELL YOUR DOCTOR
  IF YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION

     OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
        BEFORE TAKING IT.
                 [ whistle ]
           WITH COPD,
   I THOUGHT I MIGHT MISS OUT

    ON MY FAVORITE TRADITION.
   NOW SYMBICORT SIGNIFICANTLY
   IMPROVES MY LUNG FUNCTION,

   AND THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
        IN MY BREATHING.

       YOUR WIFE EVER MET

   YOUR BUDDY BELOW THE BELT,

          A HANDSHAKE,

            A KISS,
        OR AN INVITATION
        TO COME INSIDE?
              JOE?
     - WELL, THE FIRST TIME

      WAS OUR FIRST DATE.
  I REMEMBER WE WERE AT THE--
       - YOUR FIRST TIME
      WAS YOUR FIRST DATE?
         - WELL, SHE--
SHE WAS GETTING A LITTLE FRISKY.

             - OH?
    - AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
  'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, SHE LOOKED
        LIKE A NICE GIRL
    WHO WANTED TO GET AT ME,
        AND SHE KEPT ON

  TOUCHING IT AND EVERYTHING.
             - WOW!
 - SO I THINK SHE WAS GIVING ME
  AN INVITATION TO COME ON IN.
       - ALL RIGHT. ALEX?

 - UH, WELL, OUR FIRST DATE WAS
      THE TYPICAL, CHEESY
         MOVIE/DINNER.
    SO WE REALLY COULDN'T DO
  THE WHOLE "COME ON IN" THING

   IN PUBLIC THE FIRST TIME.
             - YES.
  - SO IT WAS THE WHOLE INVITE
         FOR THE KISS.
            - OKAY.
     - FOR THE FIRST TIME.

     - SO IT WAS THE KISS.
       - IT WAS THE KISS.
   AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, JOEY?
  - IT WAS THE COME ON INSIDE.

  - IT WAS THE COME ON INSIDE?
      - IT WAS DEFINITELY
        COME ON INSIDE.
      BUT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN
         AS QUICK AS...

        FIRST, SECOND--
  - IT DIDN'T HAPPEN AS QUICK,
BUT IT STILL WAS THAT INVITATION
       TO COME ON INSIDE.

      WOULD BE THE THING--

        I'LL SAY SHOES.
          - ALL RIGHT.

     - SHE'S NOT GONNA KNOW
    WHAT TO SAY EITHER, SO--
             - JOE?
- WELL, I WANT TO SAY DIAMONDS.

BUT SHE MIGHT SLAP ME FOR THAT,
           BUT, UH--
  SO I'M GOING TO SAY MAKEUP,
'CAUSE SHE ALWAYS LIKES TO PUT
      A LOT OF MAKEUP ON.

     SHE PUTS MAKEUP ON ME,
     ON THIS ONE, THAT ONE.
       SHE'S JUST ALWAYS
       PUTTING MAKEUP ON.

- AN INVITATION TO COME INSIDE,
     AND I HOPE IT'S RIGHT.
    - OH, YOU GOTTA TELL US
         ALL ABOUT IT.

  - I HAD GOTTEN MY VERY FIRST

   - IT WAS THE SECOND DATE.

            - YEAH?

 - I DID, AND FOR THOSE OF YOU
       WHO HAVE HAD ONE,
        IT WAS AWESOME.
        - YEAH? [laughs]

    - I WAS IN A GOOD MOOD,
         AND ONE THING
      JUST LED TO ANOTHER.
             - YES?

          - THAT'S IT.
       - AND THAT WAS IT.
     ALEX, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         IT WAS A KISS!
  - THAT WAS THE SECOND DATE.

             - OH.
   - I MEAN, WE WERE TALKING
     ABOUT THE FIRST DATE.
   WE DIDN'T SAY THE SECOND.
    - CLARA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

- AN INVITATION TO COME INSIDE?
- THAT'S WHAT YOUR HUSBAND SAID!
             - YAY!
          - I ALSO HAD
    A BIKINI WAX THAT NIGHT.

       - AND YOU ALSO HAD
        THE BIKINI WAX.
       - AND SHE'S RIGHT,
         IT'S AWESOME.
     - YOU'RE SUCH A CUTIE.

    - I LOVE THE BIKINI WAX,
            AWESOME.
           ALL RIGHT,

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

   I WISH MY WIFE WOULD ADOPT
  THE BELIEF THAT LESS IS MORE

            AHESHA?

            - UM...
             STOP!
        - ALEX, STOP IT.

  - UM, I'M GONNA SAY MAKEUP,
      BECAUSE IT TAKES ME
   A LONG TIME TO PUT IT ON.
    - ALEX, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

         - A LITTLE BIT
     OF A DIFFERENT ANSWER.
          - FOREPLAY.
             - NAH!

        - MORE IS MORE.
        - THAT'S RIGHT!
             ALEX!

     CLARA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - UM, I WOULD SAY LESS IS MORE
   PROBABLY WITH MY CLOTHES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

   YOU SAID WITH YOUR SHOES.
          - OH, SHOES?
YOU CAN NEVER HAVE ENOUGH SHOES.
            - YEAH.
       - THEY'RE CLOTHES.

       THEY'RE CLOTHES...
            SORT OF.
  - YEAH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA WIN
       ON THAT ONE, JOEY.
    YOU--YOU'RE REALLY NOT.
          - GOOD TRY.

       - YOU ARE SO NOT.
    KRISTIN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
           - OH, MAN.

 I THINK I'M GONNA SAY MAKEUP,
     BECAUSE I WEAR MAKEUP.
 - WELL, JOE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I THINK I SAID--
       - THAT OLD MAKEUP.

            - WHOO!
       - LADIES, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
    IF YOU WERE IN THE NEXT

   AND YOU WERE GABBING IT UP
   AT BRUNCH WITH THE GIRLS,
WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY WOULD
  BE THE NUMBER ONE COMPLAINT
 YOU'D HAVE ABOUT THE LAST TIME
        YOU TWO DID IT?

             CLARA?
        - UH, MAYBE THAT
       IT WAS TOO QUICK?
          - TOO QUICK?

    THAT LOOKS LIKE THAT WAS
 A SURPRISE TO JOEY, BUT, UH--
        HE SAID NOTHING.
        - I GOT NOTHING.
             - AW!

           - KRISTIN?
   - UM, I GO TO SLEEP EARLY,
     SO MAYBE I WAS SLEEPY.
        - WELL LET'S SEE
      WHAT YOU SAID, JOE.

     JOE SAID THE FOREPLAY.
     - YOU ALWAYS COMPLAIN
      THERE'S NO FOREPLAY,
       ALL YOU DO IS GO--
       YOU MOVE RIGHT IN,

    THIS AND THAT, COME ON!
- WELL, MAYBE 'CAUSE THERE NEEDS
      TO BE MORE FOREPLAY,
    SHE WOULDN'T BE SLEEPY.
      - THANK YOU, SHERRI!

           YES! YES!
   - AHESHA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - I'M GONNA GO WITH NOTHING.

- WITH NOTHING FOR THE LAST ONE.
   - NOTHING, NO COMPLAINTS.
          - ALL RIGHT.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
             - BAM!
   - HE SAID IT WAS TOO COLD

         THE LAST TIME.

   TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS
      THESE NEXT THREE ARE
     WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.

     ARE YOU LADIES READY?
             - YES.
             - NO.
   - DID YOU SAY NO, AHESHA?

     WHY ARE YOU NOT READY?
   - I GOTTA GET AT LEAST ONE
        QUESTION RIGHT.
      - OH. DON'T WORRY--
     WE'RE NOT EVEN HALFWAY

       THROUGH THE GAME.
          - ALL RIGHT.
      - YOU GOT SOME TIME.
           LET IT GO.
          HERE WE GO.

  YOUR HUSBAND GOES TO HOOTERS
       WITH HIS BUDDIES.
     WHICH OF THESE THINGS
    DOES HE ENJOY THE MOST?
      THE WINGS, THE BEER,
   THE COMPANY, OR THE BOOBS?

            KRISTIN?
          - THE BOOBS.
        HE'S A BOOB GUY.
       HE LIKES BOOBIES.
       - AND THERE WE GO.

         SOMEHOW I CAN
      SEE THAT ABOUT JOE.
          ABSOLUTELY.
         - YEAH. RIGHT?
   - AHESHA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - I'M GONNA GO WITH BOOBS.
         - WITH BOOBS?
         - SINCE BOOTY
   WASN'T ONE OF THE CHOICES,
    I'M GONNA GO WITH BOOBS.
   - THEN IT WOULD BE BOOBS.

             OKAY.
      - IT WOULD BE BOOBS.
            - CLARA?
 - I'M GONNA GO WITH THE WINGS.

              UM--
           - [laughs]
          - BECAUSE--
           - REALLY?
      - JOEY'S A BOOB GUY,

       BUT HE BETTER ONLY
  BE LOOKING AT MY BOOBS. SO--
            - OKAY.
         HE BETTER GET
    THAT ANSWER RIGHT, HUH?

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
 IF ALIENS ABDUCTED MY HUSBAND
     AND EXAMINED HIS BODY,

   THEY WOULD GO BACK TO MARS
      THINKING ALL HUMANS
   HAVE FUNNY LOOKING...WHAT?
            AHESHA?

         - AW! [laughs]
   I AM GONNA GO WITH MOLES,
  BECAUSE MY HUSBAND HAS, UH,
       A COUPLE OF MOLES
LIKE ON HIS CHEST, ON HIS BACK,

        ON HIS STOMACH,
  SO I'M GONNA GO WITH MOLES.
   - GONNA GO WITH THE MOLES.
 - UH, I'M GONNA GO WITH MOLES.
      - ALL RIGHT. CLARA?

  - MAYBE FUNNY-LOOKING LIPS.
  HE HAS REALLY BIG LIPS, SO--
      - YEAH? SO THE LIPS.
  - WHICH I LOVE, BY THE WAY.

   - KRISTIN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
           - [sighs]
 HE MIGHT KILL ME FOR THIS ONE.
  I'M GONNA SAY THE MAN-BOOBS.

        - THE MAN-BOOBS?
        - THE MAN-BOOBS.
  - YEAH, HE'S GONNA KILL YOU.
           THAT WAS--
             - AW.

     - NOW A QUESTION FROM
  ASHLEY FURNITURE HOMESTORE.
IF YOU CAN'T MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,
        YOU CAN AT LEAST
     MATCH YOUR FURNITURE.

           WHAT'S THE
     ONE PIECE OF FURNITURE
  IN YOUR HOME RIGHT NOW THAT
 YOU ARE JUST DYING TO REPLACE?
             CLARA?

       - UM, I WOULD SAY
     OUR DOWNSTAIRS COUCH.
        THE COUCH THAT'S
        IN THE BASEMENT.
     - ALL RIGHT. KRISTIN?

       - A KITCHEN TABLE.
        - KITCHEN TABLE?
            - YEAH.
            AHESHA?
- I'M GONNA GO WITH, UM, A SOFA.

BECAUSE THE ONE THAT WE HAVE NOW
       HAS POINTY EDGES--
           - UH-HUH.
 - AND I AM LIKE SLAMMING INTO
    THAT THING ALL THE TIME.

   HE BETTER GET THAT RIGHT.
       - I HOPE HE DOES.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
        IT IS TWO PARTS.

 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
         IF ANY MEMBER
     OF MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY

     COULD WIN AN ELECTION,
 IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE BLANK.
 BUT HIS OTHER RELATIVE, BLANK,
       WOULD HAVE TROUBLE

  GETTING EVEN A SINGLE VOTE.
            KRISTIN?
  - SO I WOULD SAY HIS DAD...
           - HIS DAD.

    - COULD WIN AN ELECTION.
          - ALL RIGHT.
        - AND HIS AUNT,
       HIS MOM'S SISTER,

   WOULD NOT WIN AN ELECTION.
          - AUNT WHO?
        WHAT'S HER NAME?
         - YOU KNOW...
           - [laughs]

       - MAYBE IT'S GINA.
         - IS IT GINA?
         - OH, MY GOD.
      JUST SAY AUNT GINA.
     - AUNT--SAY AUNT GINA.

         - WELL, YEAH.
            - OKAY.
      - HA! THAT'S SO BAD.
   - I HOPE HE--I HOPE HE HAS
      AN AUNT NAMED GINA.

         - OH--ME, TOO.
   HE DEFINITELY HAS AN AUNT.
   - AHESHA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - I AM GOING TO GO WITH
      HIS AUNT TERRI FOR--
         - WHO WOULD--
- YES, THE PERSON WHO WOULD WIN.
      - OKAY, AUNT TERRI.

  - YES, AND I'M GOING TO SAY
   THAT HIS MOMMY WOULD NOT.
   - HIS MOTHER WOULDN'T GET
    EVEN A SINGLE VOTE. WHY?
 - WELL, SHE WOULD GET MY VOTE.

           - BUT I--
   I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GONNA
         GET HER VOTE.
     CLARA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - UM, I THINK HIS SISTER
   WOULD PROBABLY BE THE ONE
       TO GET ELECTED IN.
  - WHAT'S HIS SISTER'S NAME?

          - STEFANIE.
 - AND THE PERSON THAT WOULD BE
      NOT LIKELY TO WIN...
     MAYBE HIS AUNT PATTI?

       - HIS AUNT PATTI.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.

             - YES.

     [singing word shrilly]
    - JOEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I THINK SHE SAID WINGS.

   - WHY WOULD SHE SAY WINGS?
        - I DON'T KNOW,
 'CAUSE I'VE SEEN BOOBS BEFORE,
 BUT...EVERY WING IS DIFFERENT.

             - YAY!
    - ALL RIGHT, THE WINGS.
           ALL RIGHT,
     NEXT QUESTION, FELLAS.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE

 IF ALIENS ABDUCTED MY HUSBAND
     AND EXAMINED HIS BODY,
   THEY WOULD GO BACK TO MARS

            - IT'S--

I CAN GRIP THINGS WITH MY TOES.
            - YOU--
- I GREW UP PLAYING ICE HOCKEY.

  - I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THAT,
          "THE CLAW."
       - IT'S RIDICULOUS.
       - OH, MY GOODNESS.
- AHESHA, DID YOU SAY THE CLAW?

   - THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID,
   BUT YEAH, THEY--THEY'RE--
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?

   MAYBE IT WAS THE BIG TOE,

    IT'S EITHER THAT OR MY--
- IT'S--YOU GOT A HUGE BIG TOE?
 - IT'S EITHER THAT OR MY NOSE,
      BUT I THINK THE TOE.
    - CLARA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      SHE SAID YOUR LIPS.

       - I SAID HIS LIPS.
            - LIPS.
        - I FORGOT ABOUT
      YOUR BIG ALIEN TOE.
  - OKAY, JOE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

           - [sighs]
             WELL--
         I AM ITALIAN,
     SO I'M KIND OF HAIRY.
            - OKAY.
   - SO IT COULD BE MY HAIR,

  BUT THEN I'M VERY CONSCIOUS
        ABOUT MY BOOBS,
    'CAUSE I HAVE MAN-BOOBS.
            - OKAY.

    - SO I THINK I'M GONNA--

           ALL RIGHT,
    HERE IS WHERE WE STAND.

 JOE AND KRISTIN, YOU GUYS ARE
  IN THE LEAD WITH 40 POINTS.
        YOU'RE FOLLOWED
       BY JOEY AND CLARA.
    YOU GUYS HAVE 25 POINTS.

        ALEX AND AHESHA,
      YOU HAVE TEN POINTS.
    ARE YOU READY, COUPLES?
             - YES.
         - HERE WE GO.

  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
        IF ANY MEMBER OF
      MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY
     COULD WIN AN ELECTION,

 IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE BLANK,
 BUT HIS OTHER RELATIVE, BLANK,
   WOULD HAVE TROUBLE GETTING
      EVEN A SINGLE VOTE.

             ALEX?
     - TO WIN THE ELECTION
      WOULD BE MY BROTHER,
'CAUSE HE'S GOOD AT NETWORKING,
             AND--

 - WHAT'S YOUR BROTHER'S NAME?
          - UH, CHRIS.
            - OKAY.
            - UM...

 THERE ARE SO MANY IN MY FAMILY
  THAT WOULD LOSE AN ELECTION,
      IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.
       I WOULDN'T EVEN--
    COULD I JUST SAY, LIKE,
          THE FAMILY?

     UM, PROBABLY MY COUSIN
             TORI.
   - AHESHA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
- I DIDN'T SAY EITHER OF THOSE.

          - YOU SAID--
          - OF COURSE.
   - YOUR AUNT TERRI WOULD--
           WOULD WIN,
  AND YOUR MOTHER WOULD LOSE,
       AND WOULDN'T GET--

            - YEAH.
    WE'RE GONNA GO TO JOEY.
- MY DAD COULD WIN AN ELECTION,

'CAUSE HE COULD TALK TO ANYBODY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            - AND...
 MY SISTER WOULD PROBABLY NOT,

        BECAUSE SHE JUST
   DISAGREES WITH EVERYBODY.
   - AND YOUR SISTER'S NAME?
          - STEFANIE.
    - CLARA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

- I THOUGHT STEFANIE WOULD WIN,
         AND AUNT PATTI
     WOULD NOT GET ELECTED.
        - I'M SO SORRY,
BUT THAT MEANS JOE AND KRISTIN,

        CONGRATULATIONS,
  BECAUSE YOU ARE THE WINNERS
 AND YOU ARE GOING TO JAMAICA.
      BUT, WAIT A MINUTE,

    BEFORE WE SEND YOU OFF,
    I WANT TO FIND OUT WHAT
     YOUR ANSWER WOULD BE.
    WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, JOE?

     - I THINK I WOULD HAVE
         TO SAY MY MOM,
   BECAUSE SHE THINKS, YEAH,
        SHE'S THE QUEEN.
    - OKAY, SO SHE WOULD WIN
         THE ELECTION.

 - SHE WOULD WIN THE ELECTION,
    AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
  UH, ONE OF MY NEPHEWS, ALEX,

        'CAUSE HE'S JUST
        BAD TO THE BONE.
    - OKAY, YOUR NEPHEW ALEX
      IS BAD TO THE BONE.
    KRISTIN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

    - WELL, NEITHER OF THEM.
       I SAID YOUR DAD--
   - YOUR DAD AND AUNT GINA,
    BUT WHO CARES, YOU WON.
      YOU ARE THE WINNERS!

        CONGRATULATIONS,
    YOU'RE GOING TO JAMAICA.
      AND A SPECIAL THANKS
   TO OUR RUNNER-UP COUPLES.
    DON'T WORRY, YOU'RE NOT
    GOING HOME EMPTY-HANDED.

     I'VE TRIED THAT ONCE,
     BUT I JUST HAD A DREAM
 ABOUT THE PILLSBURY DOUGHBOY.

 HERE ARE TONIGHT'S NEWYLYWEDS.
     [cheers and applause]
      HE TATTOOED HER NAME
          ON HIS WRIST

      AFTER ONLY TWO WEEKS
    TO PROVE HE WAS SERIOUS.
   IF HE WAS REALLY SERIOUS,
    HE WOULD'VE TATTOOED IT
        ON HIS FOREHEAD.

  WELCOME MAURICE AND NICOLE.
      OUR NEXT COUPLE DOES
      PHOTO SHOOTS AT HOME
   WITH EACH OTHER FOR HOURS

           AS WE SEE,

             HELLO!
              HI!
      HELLO...AND WELCOME
      TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
  FELLAS, YOU LOOK SO SNAZZY.

   HOW ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?
        all: WE'RE GOOD.
     - YOU'RE DOING GREAT?
         I AM SO GREAT.

    WE HAVE SENT YOUR WIVES
           BACKSTAGE,
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
       SO WE'RE GONNA GET
         RIGHT INTO IT.

         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.
            - OKAY.
      HERE WE GO, FELLAS.

   IF YOU AND YOUR WIFE WERE
    COMPETING IN A CONTEST,
  IN WHICH OF THESE CATEGORIES
 WOULD YOU BEAT HER HANDS DOWN?
   INTELLIGENCE, PERSONALITY,
       OR SEXUAL SKILLS?

            MAURICE?
   - DEFINITELY PERSONALITY.
 'CAUSE SHE'S SMARTER THAN ME,
       AND SHE GETS DOWN.

            - OKAY.
      SHE GETS DOWN, HUH?
        - SHE GETS DOWN.
  - OKAY, NIK, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - UM, I GUESS I WOULD SAY
      SEXUALITY, 'CAUSE--
   - THE SEXUAL SKILLS, HUH?
            - YEAH.
        I'M PRETTY GOOD.
            - DAVE?

      - I THINK WE'RE BOTH
        VERY PERSONABLE,
     AND WE BOTH LIKE TO DO
   THAT OTHER THING AS WELL.
 I THINK I HAVE A SLIGHT EDGE.

       VERY, VERY SLIGHT
        IN INTELLIGENCE.
     - JUST ONLY SLIGHTLY.
      - JUST A LITTLE BIT.
   MAYBE A LITTLE VOCABULARY.

        STUFF LIKE THAT.
          LITTLE BIT.
            - OKAY.
     SO FELLAS, HERE'S OUR
         NEXT QUESTION.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE,
           GENTLEMEN.
 I WISH I HAD A REMOTE CONTROL
          FOR MY WIFE
      JUST SO I COULD HIT
        THE MUTE BUTTON

    WHEN SHE STARTS TALKING
          ABOUT BLANK.
              NIK?
            - WORK.
        DEFINITELY WORK

            - YEAH?
    - SO I'LL JUST BE LIKE,
   "EH, YEAH, PLAY MY GAMES"
         OR SOMETHING.

       - ALL RIGHT, DAVE?
       - I'D HAVE TO SAY
 WHEN SHE STARTS PLAYING CATS.
        SHE LIKE TO MEOW
      WITH CERTAIN FRIENDS

 AND ACT OUT DIFFERENT THINGS.
  AND SOMETIMES IT GETS TO BE
      A LITTLE MUCH, BUT--
      - SO SHE PLAYS CATS
    WITH OTHER PEOPLE--MEOW.

            - YEAH.
           - LIKE...
       WITH OTHER PEOPLE?
           - CUDDLE.
         - SHE CUDDLES

        [mimicking cat]
             - YEP.
            - THAT?
        - YES, SHE DOES.
      - DOES SHE EVER PLAY
           WITH YOU?

   - I DON'T PLAY THAT OFTEN.
      BUT SHE ATTEMPTS TO.
  - THIS IS VERY INTERESTING.
             MEOW.

            - YEAH.
           - MAURICE?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
        HER COMPLAINING

       ABOUT BEING TIRED.
 - COULD SHE PERHAPS BE TIRED?
    - OH, YEAH, SHE'S TIRED.
   SHE CAN JUST GO TO SLEEP.

  - YOU JUST GET TIRED OF HER
     COMPLAINING ABOUT IT.
        - THERE YOU GO.
          - ALL RIGHT.
 SO THIS IS THE FINAL QUESTION,
           HUSBANDS.

 THINKING BACK TO YOUR WEDDING,
             GUYS,
             DAVE?
         - FIRST NAME?
             - YES.

    - IT'S OUR FRIEND ROSE.
             - YES?
    - ROSE WAS THE FREAKIEST
            DANCER.
   SHE HAD THE BIGGEST CROWD
          AROUND HER.

           - REALLY?
       - SHE WAS WORKING
      THE JERSEY TURNPIKE.
    IT WAS DEFINITELY ROSE.

   - MAURICE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - OH, THAT'S ME.
        - THAT WAS YOU?
          - OH, YEAH.

         I WAS ALL OVER
        THE DANCE FLOOR.
           - REALLY?
     - TWO APPLE MARTINIS,
      I WAS LIKE "WHOOF!"

            - OKAY.
    AND NIK, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - UM, SHE MIGHT SAY ME, BUT
 I'M GONNA SAY MY FRIEND JUDE.

             - YES.
 - UM, HE WAS--HE'S A BIG GUY.
  MAYBE ABOUT LIKE 300 POUNDS.
     DOING THE WORM ACROSS
     THE WHOLE DANCE FLOOR.

           - WAS HE?
    - AND I WAS RIDING HIM.
  SO I'M GONNA GET SOME POINTS
           FOR THAT.
     BUT I WOULD SAY JUDE.
 - SO YOU WERE RIDING THE WORM.

    - I WAS RIDING THE WORM,
         I WAS ON HIM.
    - ALL RIGHT, WE GOT YOU.
       FELLAS, NICE JOB.

         - PERSONALITY?
      - DEFINITELY, UM...
         BECAUSE HE HAS
  A GREAT, GREAT PERSONALITY.

     - ALL RIGHT, MAURICE,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
             - BAM!
     - HE SAID PERSONALITY.

            - WHOO!
       - HA, HA, BOO YA!
  AND JACKIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - I'M GONNA SAY
      PERSONALITY AS WELL,
    BECAUSE NIK TENDS TO BE
  MR. SOCIAL EVERYWHERE WE GO,
     ALWAYS MAKING FRIENDS,
           SO...YEAH.

      - THAT PERSONALITY.
      NIK, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     HE SAID SEXUAL SKILL.
     - I SAID SEXUAL SKILL.
            COME ON.

          - THANK YOU.
  - WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?
             - UH--
       - ME? UH, YOU GO.

    - NO, WOULD YOU, JACKIE?
   - THAT'S WHAT I SAID, I--
           WE CAN'T--
         - I DON'T KNOW

  - WOULD YOU AGREE WITH, UH,
       HIS SEXUAL SKILL?
   HE'S--HE'S GOT IT ON YOU?
        - I DON'T KNOW.
    - I'M KINDA GOING TO GET
    A COMPLEX NOW, BUT UH--

   - WE'LL HAVE TO TRY IT OUT
          LATER, SO--
          - UH, YEAH.
  TRY THAT OUT LATER, I THINK.

     MIMI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - I'M GOING TO GO
       WITH INTELLIGENCE.
     UM, JUST BECAUSE HE'S
   A REALLY SMART GUY, AND--

 NOT THAT I'M NOT A SMART GIRL,
        BUT I THINK HE--
 I THINK HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
         INTELLIGENCE.
   - DAVE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     HE SAID INTELLIGENCE.
     - YES. GOOD JOB, BABY.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

     HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
 I WISH I HAD A REMOTE CONTROL
          FOR MY WIFE,
      JUST SO I COULD HIT
        THE MUTE BUTTON

    WHEN SHE STARTS TALKING
         ABOUT...BLANK.
            JACKIE?
        - OH BOY, UM...

             WORK?
  - YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT WORK?
  - I DO. I COMPLAIN ABOUT IT
       A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

        UM, AND HE DOES
      TELL ME THAT, SO...
       I'M THINKING WORK.
  - OKAY, NIK, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

            - WORK!
            - WORK.
           ALL RIGHT.
     MIMI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - I'M GOING TO SAY MY FRIENDS.
  BECAUSE, UM, A LOT OF TIMES
  WE HAVE SOME DRAMA GOING ON
       WITH OUR FRIENDS.

    SO I THINK HE MIGHT SAY
 HE WANTS TO JUST MEET ME OUT.
   - WHEN YOU START TALKING
      ABOUT THESE FRIENDS.
           ALL RIGHT.
     DAVE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

     - WELL, I SAID, UM...
         PLAYING CATS.
             - OH.
             - AH.

            - OKAY.
      - MIMI, HOW DO YOU--
   SHOW ME HOW YOU PLAY CATS.
    - UM, IT'S KIND OF LIKE
  A THING ME AND MY SISTER DO.

             - OKAY
          - AND, UH--
    - OTHER FRIENDS AS WELL.
        - YEAH, I GUESS.
      OUR FRIENDS KIND OF
 HAVE JOINED IN AT THIS POINT.

            - YEAH.
           - SO DO--
       PLAY CATS WITH ME.
      HOW DO--HOW DO YOU?

       - HI SHERRI, MEOW.
- IT'S MORE IN-DEPTH THAN THAT.
  - AND I LOOK AT YOU AND GO,
    "HEY, MIMI, MEOW MEOW."

          - YES. YES.
       KIND OF LIKE THAT.
   - SO WHAT DID WE JUST SAY
         TO EACH OTHER?
    - JUST "HEY, WHAT'S UP?
       GOOD TO SEE YOU."

          - OH, OKAY.
            - YEAH.
           - NICOLE?
      - UH, I'M GONNA HAVE
       TO GO WITH MONEY.

     BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY
   ONE OF THE BIGGEST TOPICS
      OF CONVERSATION THAT
     I LOVE TO TALK ABOUT.
       - IT'S THE MONEY.

            - MONEY.
     - ALL RIGHT, MAURICE,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     - I SAID BEING TIRED.

              - OH
   - 'CAUSE YOU'RE WHINING--
        - ALWAYS TIRED.
     - YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
- YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT THAT A LOT?

   - UH, YEAH. I WORK A LOT
    TO MAKE THE MONEY, SO--
         SO I'M TIRED.
        - THERE YOU GO.
       GOES HAND IN HAND.

           - IT DOES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
        LADIES, THIS IS
       OUR FINAL QUESTION

     WE ASKED YOU HUSBANDS
 TO THINK BACK TO YOUR WEDDING
      AND TELL US, WHO WAS
      THE FUNNIEST PERSON
      ON YOUR DANCE FLOOR.

   WHO DO YOU THINK HE SAID?
             MIMI?
  - I'M GOING TO GO WITH ROSE.
       - WITH ROSE--WHY?

  - UM, BECAUSE SHE WAS DOING
      THE JERSEY TURNPIKE
        ALL NIGHT LONG.
  IT WAS QUITE A SCENE ON OUR
          DANCE FLOOR.

    - HOW EXACTLY DOES THE--
           WHAT IS--
        HOW EXACTLY DOES
    THE JERSEY TURNPIKE GO?
          - IT'S UM--
     SHOULD I DEMONSTRATE?

      - YEAH, COULD YOU?
        WOULD YOU MIND?
 YEAH, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT.
    YOU GONNA SHOW US, TOO?
            COME ON!

 - I'LL DO THE JERSEY TURNPIKE
         TO YOU, RIGHT?
         I'LL BE ROSE.
            - OKAY.
     [cheers and laughter]

      - ALL THE WAY DOWN.
       - ALL THE WAY DOWN
      THE JERSEY TURNPIKE.
 - THAT WAS ROSE, ALL THE WAY
      DOWN TO THE GROUND?

       - YEAH. OH, YEAH.
          - MEOW. WOW.
    - SHE WAS--SHE WAS GOOD.
      SHE WAS REALLY GOOD.

            - OKAY.
    DAVE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - I ENDED UP SAYING ROSE
            AS WELL.
         - IT WAS ROSE.
       - SO THAT WAS MY--

           - AWESOME.
           - NICOLE?
- HE WAS DEFINITELY THE FUNNIEST
     PERSON AT THE WEDDING.

           HE KISSED
   EVERY SINGLE PERSON THERE.
 HE WAS DOING, LIKE, CARTWHEELS
       AND--I DON'T KNOW.
HE WAS DEFINITELY THE FUNNIEST.

   - BOY, WHEN YOU WANT THAT
         WINNING POINT
     HIT A CARTWHEEL, HUH,
            MAURICE?
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

             - ME.
     - HE SAID IT WAS HIM.
            JACKIE?
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH
        OUR FRIEND JUDE.

          - YEAH, WHY?
 - HE WAS QUITE THE ENTERTAINER
          THAT NIGHT.
     HE WAS DOING THE WORM,

 HE WAS PULLING MY MOM UP THERE
          AND DANCING.
     - NIK, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            - JUDE.

  ASHLEY FURNITURE HOMESTORE.
    SPLURGE ON YOUR WEDDING,
    SAVE ON YOUR FURNITURE.

       IF YOU WERE FORCED
     TO EVACUATE YOUR HOME
     AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE,
    WHAT PIECE OF FURNITURE
   WOULD YOU PERSONALLY CARRY

        OUT ON YOUR BACK
     TO INSURE ITS SAFETY?
            JACKIE?

     - OH, FURNITURE, UM...
MAYBE MY WINE RACK IN MY KITCHEN
   BECAUSE IT'S A NICE PIECE
  AND I TEND TO FAVOR IT, SO--

   - YOU FAVOR THE WINE RACK
   OR THE WINE THAT'S IN IT?
       - WELL, YOU KNOW.
         - YEAH, BOTH.
   - IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.
          - ALL RIGHT.

             MIMI?

   ABLE TO ACTUALLY CARRY IT
     BUT I'M GONNA SAY BED.

    YOU WOULD ASK HIM ABOUT?

      - ALL RIGHT, NICOLE?
    - WHAT HE DID THE NIGHT
     OF HIS BACHELOR PARTY.
            - OKAY.
            JACKIE?

   - UH, ALTHOUGH I WOULDN'T
   WANT TO KNOW THE ANSWERS,
   I WOULD PROBABLY ASK ABOUT
  A FEW OF HIS FEMALE FRIENDS
      AND THEIR FRIENDSHIP
          IN THE PAST.

  IT WOULD BE SASSY AND SWEET.

 WHICH TWO WORDS WOULD YOU PICK
         FOR YOURSELF?
            NICOLE?
     - NAUGHTY, DEFINITELY,
        I WOULD GO WITH,

     AND I WOULD SAY NICE--

      - SO YOU GOT THE YIN
  AND THE YANG OF WHO YOU ARE.

        - THAT'S RIGHT.
      - ALL RIGHT, JACKIE?
