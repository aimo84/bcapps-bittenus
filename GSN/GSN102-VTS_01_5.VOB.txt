       MATCH THE ANSWERS
     THAT THEIR WIVES GAVE.
       ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
        HERE'S THE FIRST

  OF OUR TEN POINT QUESTIONS.
   WHEN YOUR WIFE IS LOOKING
 TO START A BEDROOM JAM SESSION
           WITH YOU,
WHAT'S THE ONE THING SHE CAN DO

        THAT NEVER FAILS
        TO JAZZ YOU UP?
       BLOW YOUR TRUMPET,
      RIDE YOUR HIGH HAT,

        OR LET YOU PLAY
        WITH HER BONGOS?
            MAURICE?
             - UM--
            [laughs]

 I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH THAT
  FIRST ONE, BLOW MY TRUMPET.
      - BLOW YOUR TRUMPET.
    - [makes trumpet sounds]

    [laughter and applause]
    - I LOVE SOUND EFFECTS.
       ALL RIGHT, NICOLE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

       BLOW YOUR TRUMPET!
      - BLOW THE TRUMPET.
          - ALL RIGHT.
      NIK, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - BLOW MY TRUMPET, AS WELL.
I'M NOT GONNA DO A, UH, A SOUND,
  'CAUSE I'M NOT AS GOOD AT IT
    AS YOU, BUT...I'M SORRY.

          - WE GOT IT.
    WE GOT IT IN OUR HEADS.
       - [trumpet sound]
      - THERE YOU GO, BRO.
   - JACKIE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       BLOW YOUR TRUMPET!
       AND JACKIE, I HEAR
 CONGRATULATIONS ARE IN ORDER.
ARE YOU EXPECTING A LITTLE ONE?

- THIS IS TRUE, YES, THANK YOU.
       - CONGRATULATIONS!
          OKAY, DAVE?
         - I WOULD SAY
   IT'S GOTTA BE THE BONGOS.

    - PLAY WITH THE BONGOS.
  - I SAID BLOW...THE TRUMPET.
     - AW. THAT'S NOT GOOD.
    - FELLAS, NEXT QUESTION.

   NOW A QUESTION FROM ASHLEY
      FURNITURE HOMESTORE.
 IF YOU WERE FORCED TO EVACUATE
YOUR HOME AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE,
    WHAT PIECE OF FURNITURE
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY

      SHE WOULD PERSONALLY
     CARRY OUT ON HER BACK
     TO INSURE ITS SAFETY?
              NIK?

   - IS IT FOR ME OR FOR HER?
  - FOR YOUR WIFE, WHAT WOULD
YOUR WIFE CARRY OUT ON HER BACK?
 I'LL GO WITH MY XBOX, I GUESS.

          - THE XBOX.
   ALL RIGHT, JACKIE, YOU'RE
SHAKING YOUR HEAD. WHAT'D YOU--
 - THAT IS LIKE THE LAST THING
       THAT I WOULD SAVE.

           - FOR ME.
      - IT'S NOT FOR YOU.
  - WELL IF YOU DID IT FOR ME,
       IT WOULD BE THAT.

   - IF I DID IT FOR MYSELF,
 MY FAVORITE PIECE OF FURNITURE
       IS OUR WINE RACK.
      - IS THE WINE RACK.

            - YEAH.
          - YOUR XBOX.
 - WELL, I THOUGHT YOU WOULD DO
       SOMETHING FOR ME--
          - MMM...NO.

       - BUT I GUESS NOT.
     - GEEZ, SHE'S CARRYING
          YOUR CHILD.
  THAT'S ABOUT THE BEST THING.

      - WE DON'T KNOW YET.
            - OKAY.
              OH!

       I GOT A FEELING--
 I GOT A FEELING NIK DOES THIS
         ALL THE TIME.
- I GOT A FEELING HE'S SLEEPING
      IN HIS CAR TONIGHT.

     - NOT EVEN THE COUCH?
             - NO.
       - NIK--OH, MY GOD.
 - I'LL SLEEP ON THE WINE RACK.

 - OKAY, DAVE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I WOULD SAY OUR--
      WE HAVE PET FERRETS,
AND I WOULD SAY OUR FERRET CAGE
       WOULD BE SOMETHING

    THAT SHE WOULD MAKE SURE
      WAS THE FIRST THING
     THAT SHE CARRIED OUT.
    - THE FERRET CAGE, OKAY.
             - YUP.

 - MIMI, IS IT THE FERRET CAGE?
   - I WENT WITH FURNITURE,
      I WENT WITH OUR BED.
        I LOVE OUR BED.
          - ALL RIGHT.

     - IT'S SO COMFORTABLE.
            - OKAY.
      - IT'S MY FAVORITE.
     - YEAH, I KNOW, RIGHT.
   - MAURICE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

             - UM,
  I THINK IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
            OUR BED.
   'CAUSE IT'S BIG AND COMFY.
     - IT'S BIG AND COMFY.

            - YEAH.
         GOOD CUSHIONS.
- OKAY. NICOLE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            THE BED!
     - I WENT WITH OUR BED!

       - I'M GONNA GO ON
     TO THE NEXT QUESTION.
   LET'S SAY YOU WERE SLIPPED
       SOME TRUTH SERUM.
    WHAT IS THE FIRST THING

         YOUR WIFE SAID
    SHE WOULD ASK YOU ABOUT?
             DAVE?
- TO A PRETTY LARGE EXTENT I'M--
   I'M VERY HONEST WITH HER.

     - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN,
   TO A PRETTY LARGE EXTENT?
            - WELL--
         WELL, I TELL--

       I MIGHT TELL MIMI
    THAT I'M STAYING AT WORK
 A LITTLE BIT LATER...WORKING,
  WHEN I'M REALLY NOT WORKING
  AND I MIGHT BE ENJOYING A...
 A BEER, OR SOMETHING, SO...NO?

- SHE SAID WHEN YOU GOT ARRESTED
         IN SAN DIEGO.
             - OH!
      - I'M NOT 100% SURE
IF YOU EVEN GOT ARRESTED, BUT--

             - NO.
- SO, I KNEW SOMETHING HAPPENED
         IN SAN DIEGO.
 - WHAT HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO?
    WERE YOU HAVING A BEER,
         OR SOMETHING?

           - UH, NO.
  EARLIER IN THE NIGHT I WAS.
          - OH, OKAY.
    MAURICE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - UM, I DON'T--I'M NOT SURE,
  I THINK IT WOULD PROBABLY BE
LIKE, UM, IF I SPENT ANY MONEY.
   - NICOLE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       THE NIGHT OF YOUR
        BACHELOR PARTY.
     WHAT REALLY HAPPENED?

          - OKAY, NIK?
 - PROBABLY MY BACHELOR PARTY.
  - REALLY, WHAT WAS GOING ON?

  - UM, BUT IT WASN'T ANYTHING
         THAT WAS BAD.
     - IT WASN'T ANYTHING?
      - NO, IT WAS...YEAH.

    - AND SHE'S ALWAYS LIKE,

          "WHO'S THAT?
