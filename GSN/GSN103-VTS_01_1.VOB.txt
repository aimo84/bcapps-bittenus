  I'm Dylan Lane, and welcome
       to <i>Chain Reaction.</i>

Today twins Colleen and Bridget,
    and their friend Tracy,
    and aspiring filmmakers
    Travis, Alex, and Dylan
      face off in a battle
         of the sexes,

racing to connect pairs of words
  that form a multipart chain.
Now each correct answer
earns you cold, hard cash.
   And if you play this game
          really well,

      you could take home
       a whole lot of it.
But first, we need
a chain.
Players, you're going to have
to connect the word...

SWEET with the word...
GOAL.
Correct answers are worth $100
in this opening round.

  And ladies, you won the toss
           backstage
   so you'll get to go first.
   Let's start with Bridget.

     You can take a letter
          below SWEET
    or above the word GOAL.
      I'll take the letter
          below SWEET.

            (Dylan)
      Mm-hmm, a letter P.
PEA.
   Just PEA, okay, let's see
       if it's SWEET PEA.

    That's correct, Bridget!
      You're on the board
           with $100.
     [cheers and applause]

           All right.
    Colleen, it's your turn.
      Where would you like
          your letter?

     Um, under PEA, please.
            (Dylan)
               G.
       What do you think,
            Colleen?

PEA...GOOD.
            (Dylan)
           PEA GOOD.
           All right.

  Let's see PEA GOOD, please.
        I'm gonna leave
        that one alone.
            (Tracy)
          Good guess.

            (Dylan)
    Okay, Travis, your turn.
      Where would you like
          your letter?
           Under PEA.

            (Dylan)
               R.
Uh, PEA GREAT.
           Let's see
   if it's better than good,

           PEA GREAT.
         No, incorrect.
    Okay, Tracy, your turn.

     Uh, I'll go under PEA.
            (Dylan)
      A letter under PEA.
PEA GREEN?

     Hey, Tracy says GREEN!
   Let's see the word GREEN!
   That's the correct answer.

           [applause]
   Okay, Bridget, your turn.
Where would you like to go?

    Uh, above GOAL, please.
            (Dylan)
       Okay, that's an F.
FOOT?

    Let's see if it's FOOT.
    No, it's not FOOT GOAL.
     Okay, Alex, your turn.

      Where would you like
          your letter?
    Um, I'll go above GOAL.
FINAL.

            (Dylan)
Is it FINAL GOAL as Alex thinks?
     No, incorrect, sorry.
       Control goes back
         to the girls.

      Colleen, your turn.
   All right, under--I mean,
          above GOAL.
            (Dylan)
Okay, letter above GOAL, please.

FIELD GOAL.
       Is it FIELD GOAL?
        That's correct!

       All right, ladies,
        you've got $300.
  And, Tracy, it's your turn.
    Um, I'll go below GREEN.

            (Dylan)
          That's an O.
GREEN...OPEN?
        Okay, that--OPEN
       begins with an O.

    Let's see if it's OPEN.
         No, not open.
   Control goes to the guys.

Dylan--great name, by the way--
      where would you like
          your letter?
          Uh, above F.

            (Dylan)
          That's an O.
O...OPEN.
       Is it OPEN FIELD?

         No, incorrect.
    Okay, control goes back
          to the gals.
      Bridget, your turn.

        Um, below GREEN.
            (Dylan)
            Okay, L.
Um, GREEN OLD?

        GREEN OLD, okay.
  Let's see if it's GREEN OLD.
    Okay, if it's GREEN OLD,
    you better throw it out.

       Travis, your turn.
   Uh, let's go above FIELD.
            (Dylan)
            Okay, I.

OIL.
 Travis thinks it's OIL FIELD.
    Let's see the word OIL.

   Guys, you're on the board!
 Okay, Alex, I'm gonna give you
           a letter.
    And let's see if you can
      complete this chain.

  Give Alex a letter, please.
      I think I've got it.
I'm gonna go with OLIVE.

            (Dylan)
     Gonna go out on a limb
         and say OLIVE
     to complete the chain.
         That's right!

     That's a chain, it's:
Guys, since you
correctly completed that chain,
you'll get
our first Speed Chain.

 It's worth $100, and you have
         seven seconds
     to connect the word...
     FALL with the word...

             TIME.
         Starting now.
            (Dylan)
  All right, guys, time's up.

       What do you think?
   FALL SEASON, SEASON SUPER,
          SUPER TIME.
            (Dylan)
   SEASON SUPER, SUPER TIME?

   We're having a SUPER TIME.
           No, it's:
Okay, guys, you've fallen behind
            by $100

so you're gonna get first crack
at our second chain of the day.
   This time, correct answers
        are worth $200.
Players, you've gotta connect
the word...

SPERM with the word...
BANK.
           (Bridget)
   They're already connected.

            (Dylan)
             Okay.
  Uh, let's start with Dylan,
        where would you
 like your letter, below SPERM
         or above BANK?

          Below SPERM.
            (Dylan)
               W.
Uh, SPERM...WATER.

           [laughter]
            (Dylan)
   Let's see the word WATER.
     It's not SPERM WATER.

       Girls, your turn.
 Colleen, where would you like
          your letter?
Can I have it, uh, under SPERM,
            please?

            (Dylan)
   Yes, you may have a letter
          below SPERM.
               H.
Um...

            (Dylan)
  What do you think, Colleen?
SPERM WHACK?
That doesn't even mat--

Colleen...let's see
if it's WHACK.
           [laughter]
            (Dylan)
              No.

             Okay.
Family show, Colleen.
Okay, Travis, your turn.

      Where would you like
          your letter?
  Let's go under--under SPERM.
            (Dylan)
           Mm-hmm, A.

Uh, SPERM WHALE.
    Travis says SPERM WHALE.
         Is that right?

    Yeah, guys, you're ahead
            by $100.
And Alex, it's your turn.
Where would you like
your letter?

  I'll go under WHALE, please.
            (Dylan)
        Your letter's W.
Um...

    What do you think, Alex?
Uh, WHALE...WA--WIND.
            [buzzer]
            (Dylan)
      Sorry, out of time.

        Buzzer sounded.
    Okay, Tracy, your turn.
      I'll go under WHALE.

            (Dylan)
  Okay, a letter under WHALE,
            please.
Uh, WHALE WATCH?
       Hey, Tracy thinks
       it's WHALE WATCH.

        Is that correct?
       Yeah, that's good!
     [cheers and applause]

Okay, Bridget, where would you
like your letter?
          Under WATCH.
            (Dylan)
      Under WATCH, please.

               F.
Uh, WATCH FIND?
            (Dylan)
             Okay.

    Let's see if it's FIND.
         No, it's not.
    Okay, control goes over
           to Dylan.

      Where would you like
          your letter?
          Above BANK.
            (Dylan)
          That's an R.

Uh...
   What do you think, Dylan?
R-ROAD.

            (Dylan)
     Okay, is it ROAD BANK?
         No, it's not.
         Okay, Colleen.

       Um, can I have it
      under WATCH, please?
            (Dylan)
  Letter under WATCH, please.
  What do you think, Colleen?

Uh, WATCH FAMILY?
            (Dylan)
             Okay.
      Is it WATCH FAMILY?

            [buzzer]
       It's like the line
           of Timex.
       Family of watches.

    Travis, where would you
       like your letter?
          Under WATCH.
WATCH FACE.

            (Dylan)
 Travis thinks it's WATCH FACE.
I'm so good
at this game.
    Let's see the word FACE.

        That's correct.
           [applause]
     Okay, Alex, your turn.

      You're in the lead.
      Where would you like
          your letter?
      I'll go above BANK.

RIVER.
            (Dylan)
       Is it RIVER BANK?
        That's correct.

     [cheers and applause]
 All right, you guys have $800.
     Dylan, it's your turn.

  I'm gonna give you a letter.
 Let's see if you can complete
           the chain.
Uh...

            (Dylan)
   What do you think, Dylan?
            [buzzer]

            (Dylan)
       Out of time, okay.
          Control goes
       over to the girls.
    Girls, can you complete
           the chain?

     Tracy, let's give you
           a letter.
FACE...D OVER?
            (Dylan)
             Okay.

          Let's see if
        it's FACE DOVER.
            (Tracy)
             Sorry.
            (Dylan)
  No, incorrect, control goes
      back over to Travis.

   Travis, let's see a letter
            for you.
Uh, DOWN.
            (Dylan)
  Okay, to complete the chain,
          is it DOWN?

         That's right!
        That's a chain!
             It's:

 And, guys, since you completed
       that second chain,
       you'll get to play
    our second Speed Chain.
You've gotta connect the word...

  DISPOSABLE with the word...
           DECISION.
 Your seven seconds start now.

            (Dylan)
        Nice work, guys.
       What do you think?
DISPOSABLE DIAPER, DIAPER RASH,
RASH DECISION.

            (Dylan)
  DIAPER RASH, RASH DECISION?
        That's correct!
   All right, nice job, guys.

       When we come back,
  the word gameplay continues!
         Stick around.
     [cheers and applause]

 Welcome back to <i>Chain Reaction.</i>

       Let's get to know
 our two teams a little better.
      Okay, ladies, how do
    you all know each other?
    Um, well, Bridget and I
           are twins.

     And we've known Tracy
 since we were in high school.
 We sat in math class together.
            (Dylan)
             Cool.

    You twins, I understand,
     have a beaten-up car?
Yeah, it's
a Plymouth Sundance.
And we painted it purple
with pink and green polka dots.

We call it
The Purple People Eater.
           It's hot.
It's pretty cool.

            (Dylan)
          Sounds hot.
    Gentlemen, I understand
 that Travis, Dylan, and Alex,
you have sort of an interesting
     team dynamic going on?

It's mostly just Dylan and I
making fun of Alex.
For, uh, like, that, the hair.
Or the glasses, or the, like,
voice thing.

But, uh, then, we came on here,
and Dylan wasn't been able
to answer a question yet
so it'll probably be
the two of us versus him.

        Oh, I like that.
            (Dylan)
        All right, well,
    you're leading the game.
  And, ladies, you're trailing
   by $700 so we'll give you

a chance to catch up
and kick off our third chain.
This time, players,
you have to connect the word...
CHOKE with the word...

MARY.
Okay, correct answers are
now worth $300,
and Bridget, we're gonna
start off with you.

Where would you like
your letter?
    Can we start above MARY?
            (Dylan)
   Yes, a letter above MARY.

               Q.
QUEEN?
            (Dylan)
    Bridget says QUEEN MARY.

   Is that the right answer?
      Yeah, that's right!
     [cheers and applause]

  That brings you up to $800.
      Colleen, your turn.
      A letter below CHOKE
        or above QUEEN?

  Uh, can I have below CHOKE,
            please?
            (Dylan)
  Letter below CHOKE, please.
               H.
CHO--CHOKE HAZARD?

      CHOKE HAZARD, okay.
   Let's see the word HAZARD.
        Sorry, Colleen,
      that's not correct.

    Goes over to Alex. Alex?
     I'll take under CHOKE.
            (Dylan)
  Letter under CHOKE, please.

CHOKE HOLD?
     Alex is guessin' HOLD.
        Let's see HOLD.

        That's correct!
     [cheers and applause]
   A CHOKE HOLD cuts off air
         and blood flow

     from around the neck.
    Okay, Dylan, your turn.
   Below HOLD or above QUEEN?

          Above QUEEN.
            (Dylan)
          That's a B.
Uh, BEE?

QUEEN?
      Okay, let's see BEE.
        No, not correct.

Control goes back to the girls.
             Tracy?
    Uh, I'll go above QUEEN.
  Letter above QUEEN, please.

Show me BEAUTY, Dylan.
            (Dylan)
       Let's see BEAUTY!
             Nice.

     [cheers and applause]
       Nice work, Tracy.
     Okay, ladies, you have
            $1,100.

            Bridget.
           (Colleen)
   Let's go, Bridge, come on.
    How 'bout above BEAUTY?

            (Dylan)
        Your letter's S.
SEA.
           SEA, okay.

    Bridget's guessing SEA.
        Is that correct?
         No, it's not.

    Okay, control goes back
          to the guys.
 Travis, your turn, where would
        you like your--
    Can we go above BEAUTY?

Uh, SLEEPING BEAUTY.
            (Dylan)
Travis guesses SLEEPING BEAUTY.
      Let's see SLEEPING.

     Yeah, that's correct!
     <i>Sleeping Beauty</i> came out
      in 1959 from Disney.
Okay, guys, control
is still yours.

 Alex, I'll give you a letter,
 let's see if you can complete
          this chain.
               O.

OVER?
            (Dylan)
             Okay.
        Alex says OVER.

        That's correct,
     that's a chain, guys!
             It's:
     Okay, guys, since you
correctly completed that chain,

       you'll get to play
     our final Speed Chain.
    You've got seven seconds
     to connect the word...
   AMERICAN with the word...

            SPIRIT.
         Beginning now.
            (Dylan)
     Okay, guys, for $300.

       What do you think?
  AMERICAN DREAM, DREAM TEEN,
          TEEN SPIRIT.
            (Dylan)
    DREAM TEEN, TEEN SPIRIT?

            [buzzer]
    No, it's AMERICAN DREAM,
     DREAM <i>TEAM,</i> TEAM SPIRIT.
         Okay, ladies,
 you're still behind by $1,000.

 But it's still anybody's game.
Who's going to the bonus round?
    Stay tuned and find out.

     [cheers and applause]
            (Dylan)
 Welcome back to <i>Chain Reaction.</i>
    The girls trail the guys
           by $1,000

      so we're gonna start
           with them.
        But keep in mind
    that in our final chain,
    You can wager up to $500
         at each turn.

Now, you stand to make
a lot of money really quick,
but you also stand to lose
that money just as quick.
So bet carefully.

The last chain of the day
begins with the word...
INSTANT and ends
with the word...
CLOTH.

 Colleen, you get to go first.
     So, how much would you
         like to wager,
and where would you
like your letter to go?

 Can I have a 100, um, above--
     I mean, under INSTANT.
            (Dylan)
   Okay, $100 under INSTANT.
               M.

INSTANT MATCH?
            (Dylan)
   Okay, Colleen says MATCH.
   Is that the right answer?

         No, it's not.
      Just lost 100 bucks.
     Okay, guys, your turn.

  Dylan, where would you like
  your letter, and how much?
     Uh, 100 under INSTANT.
            (Dylan)
             Okay.

       Your letter is E.
MEAL?
            (Dylan)
  Is it INSTANT MEAL for $100?

         No, it's not.
   Okay, still $1,000 apart.
       Tracy, your turn.

       Uh, can I get $200

Is it INSTANT MESSAGE for $200?
          Yes, it is!
     [cheers and applause]

 Instant message is also known

   Okay, Bridget, your turn.
How much you willing to gamble,

            Oh, 100.
      $100 below MESSAGE.
BOARD.

            (Dylan)
      Is it MESSAGE BOARD
        for a 100 bucks?
      Yeah, that's right.
     [cheers and applause]

     with INSTANT MESSAGE.
        A message board
       is an online forum
         serving people

   Okay, Colleen, your turn.
   How much money you willing

    and where would you like
          your letter?

        Could I have 100
      above CLOTH, please?
            (Dylan)
       Your letter is D.
DRY CLOTH?

    Is it DRY CLOTH for 100?
   No, I'm sorry, that's not
      the correct answer.
 Control goes over to the boys.

       Travis, your turn.
      How much and where?
      Uh, 500 above CLOTH.

            (Dylan)
  $500, a letter above CLOTH.
           That's R.
DR--DROP CLOTH.
     Travis says DROP CLOTH
         for 500 bucks.

         That's right!
  You usually use a drop cloth
     when you're painting.
  Cover the furniture with it.

Okay, guys, you have $2,500.
Alex, it's your turn.
      How much and where?

      Um, I'll just go 100
          under BOARD.
               C.
    What do you think, Alex?

BOARD CALL.
            (Dylan)
             Okay.
  Is it BOARD CALL for a 100?

         No, I'm sorry,
 that's not the correct answer.
       Control goes back
         to the girls.
       Tracy, your turn.

      How much and where?
        100 under BOARD.

BOARD CERTIFIED.

  Dylan says BOARD CERTIFIED.
          Is he right?
 Yeah, that's 300 bucks, guys.

              One!
          You got one!
       (Contestant Dylan)
            Finally!

            (Dylan)
             Okay.
   Travis, comes down to you.
  I'm gonna give you a letter,
        you just tell me

    how much you're willing
           to gamble
     that you can complete
          this chain.
            Uh, 200.

            (Dylan)
             $200.
          That's an M.
Uh...

            (Dylan)
   What do you think, Travis?
CERTI--
            [buzzer]
  Answer something, 'cause you
      just lost 200 bucks

     and control goes over
         to the girls.
   Okay, Bridget, your turn.
             Um...

            (Dylan)
How much you willing to gamble?
           Um...200.
          Okay, $200.

  And let's give her a letter.
           It's an A.
MAN?

            (Dylan)
              MAN?
MAN.
  Okay, let's see if it's MAN.

       Not correct, okay.
        Alex, how much?
    I don't know what it is,
       I'm just gonna go

      100 under CERTIFIED.
            (Dylan)
     $100 under CERTIFIED.
          That's an I.

Oh, MAIL.
            (Dylan)
 Okay, Alex says CERTIFIED MAIL
          for the win.
        That's correct!

   Guys, you're the winners.
 Ladies, thank you for playing.
      Very nice job today.

 All right, when we come back,

     YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR
     DOCTOR DOING YOUR JOB.

IT'S NOT CAUSED BY
A HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
         HE WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
             BUT I'VE PUT HIM ON
               PRADAXA INSTEAD.
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA 150
  MGS REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%

   MORE THAN WARFARIN WITHOUT
   THE NEED FOR REGULAR BLOOD
             TESTS.
 I SURE WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
  PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING. DON'T
    TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU HAVE
  ABNORMAL BLEEDING, AND SEEK
           IMMEDIATE

  MEDICAL CARE FOR UNEXPECTED
       SIGNS OF BLEEDING,
     LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
PRADAXA MAY INCREASE YOUR
 BLEEDING RISK IF YOU'RE 75 OR
             OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
     LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,

  OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS, OR
 BLOODTHINNERS, OR IF YOU HAVE
        KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
 ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE CERTAIN
           MEDICINES.
   TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ALL
MEDICINES YOU TAKE, ANY PLANNED
 MEDICAL OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,

 AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,
    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
