       HELLO, AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>

         HELLO, FELLAS.
        - HELLO, SHERRI.
       - ALL RIGHT, WELL,
  WE SENT YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.

     LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT.
     GENTLEMEN, IF YOU WERE
         ABOUT TO HAVE
  THE LAST MEAL OF YOUR LIFE,
WHO WOULD YOU WANT TO COOK IT--

    YOUR MOTHER, YOUR WIFE,
          OR THE CHEF
  AT YOUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT?
             MATT.

   - WELL, UH, BOTH MY MOTHER
          AND MY WIFE,
    UM, ALTHOUGH THEIR HEART
           IS IN IT,
 I WOULD PROBABLY PICK THE CHEF
   AT MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

      - AHH. NOT YOUR MOM,
         NOT YOUR WIFE?
 - MY WIFE IS--IS A GREAT COOK,
         BUT WE'D BOTH
       RATHER BE FOODIES

           AND GO OUT
      AND ADVENTURE, SO...
          - OH, OKAY.
            - YEAH.
   - WHAT'D YOU SAY, ANTHONY?

    - I WOULD HAVE TO AGREE
      WITH MATT, THE CHEF.
      - REALLY, THE CHEF?
     - YES. MY WIFE REALLY
        DON'T COOK MUCH.

         MY MOM REALLY
    DON'T COOK MUCH NEITHER
        NOW THAT I'M NOT
    WITH HER NO MORE, SO...
            - OKAY.

      - I WOULD HAVE TO GO
         WITH THE CHEF.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, MICHAEL?
 - WELL, SHERRI, UH, MY WIFE'S
        A GREAT MOTHER.

   SHE COOKS--NOT THE BEST...
           - [laughs]
   - BUT SHE LOVES TO CLEAN.
       SHE HATES TO COOK.
   SHE'LL EVEN TELL YOU THAT.

 BUT I'D HAVE TO SAY MY MOTHER.
            - YEAH?
     - UH, SHE'S NO LONGER
    WITH US, UNFORTUNATELY,
  BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ONE
 MORE MEAL FROM HER IF I COULD.

          - OH, YEAH?
 - MY WIFE WOULD DEFINITELY SAY
     NOT HER, SO DEFINITELY
           MY MOTHER.
 - WHAT--WHAT WAS YOUR FAVORITE
      MEAL WITH YOUR MOM?

     - UH, I'D SAY PROBABLY
      THANKSGIVING DINNER,
ALL THE FIXINGS, AND THE TURKEY,
       STUFFING IN THERE,
CRANBERRY SAUCE, MAC AND CHEESE,
     EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?

   - SHE WOULD SPEND ALL DAY
 COOKIN' AND GET THE PERFECT--
    - YEP, AND THEN YOU TAKE
  A NAP RIGHT AFTER--PERFECT.
          EVERYTHING.
  - OKAY. THAT'S HEAVEN, HUH?

       - YEP. YES, MA'AM.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
       THE COW SAYS MOO,
      THE DUCK SAYS QUACK,

     AND MY WIFE DURING SEX
         SAYS "BLANK."
            ANTHONY.
   - I WOULD SAY, "WOW. WOW."

 - LIKE, "WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE
         ALL OF THIS."
         - YEAH, YEAH.
            - "WOW."
        - OKAY. MICHAEL.

    - I'D HAVE TO SAY "AHH"
       WITH A LOT OF H's
        BEHIND THE "A."
             - AHH.
       - LIKE, "AHHHHHH."

   LIKE, A LOT OF 'EM. "AHH."
     THAT'S WHAT I'LL SAY.
    - YEAH, JUST LIKE THAT.
         - YEAH, OKAY.
            [laughs]

           ALL RIGHT.
   AND, MATT, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - PROBABLY, UH, "MMM."
            - "MMM"?
 - BUT, LIKE, UH, A GOOD "MMM."
            A "MMM!"

            - YEAH.
    - BUT DOES SHE STOP IT?
           JUST--MMM.
  AND JUST--OR DOES SHE KEEP--

       - WELL, IT'S A LOT
       OF SHORT "MMMs..."
          - OH, OKAY.
   - AND THEN ONE LONG "MMM."
   - SO A LOT OF MMM-MM-MMM.
   - IT'S MM-MMM, DELICIOUS.

   - OKAY. HUSBANDS, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
       I LOVE SURPRISES,
 SO TELL ME ABOUT THE LAST TIME
    YOUR WIFE BLEW YOU AWAY

    WITH AN EROTIC SURPRISE.
            MICHAEL.
 - I THINK IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO
        ON MY BIRTHDAY,

  SHE HAD A SEXY GAME PLANNED.
       SHE TOLD ME TO GO
         TO THE STORE.
 I CAME BACK, THERE WAS A NOTE
       ON THE FRONT DOOR.

  IT SAID, "UNLOCK THE DOOR."
      YOU GO TO THE NEXT--
    NEXT CLUE IN THE HOUSE,
        YOU FIND THIS--
 LIKE, I HAD TO FIND SOMETHING
      IN THE REFRIGERATOR.

        THEN I HAD TO GO
        IN THE BASEMENT,
         FIND SOMETHING
      IN THE LIVING ROOM,

         AND THEN I GOT
      THE MAGICAL SURPRISE
      WHEN I GOT UPSTAIRS
        TO THE BEDROOM.
- OHH, AND WHAT WAS SHE WEARING?
  - NOT TOO MUCH OF ANYTHING.

     - OHH. SO IT WAS LIKE
     A SEXY SCAVENGER HUNT.
        - YEAH, EXACTLY,
  THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT WAS.
          - OH, OKAY.
           - UH-HUH.

    - MATT, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - PROBABLY OUR FIRST
  ANNIVERSARY, BACK IN APRIL.
           - MM-HMM.
- WE STAYED AT THE RITZ-CARLTON,

 AND THEN, UM, THE WHOLE THING
          WAS PLANNED,
  BUT SHE BROUGHT IN CHAMPAGNE
         AND, YOU KNOW,
   LITTLE ACCESSORIES, AND...

       - LIKE A SWEATER?
 - LIKE A SWEATER, SUSPENDERS.
        NO, IT'S, UH...
     LIKE, A LITTLE BLACK,
         UH, NEGLIGEE.

- OKAY. ALL RIGHT, SOUNDS GOOD.
            ANTHONY.
   - I'D PROBABLY HAVE TO SAY
          LAST MONTH.
UH, I WAS SLEEPING AND I WOKE UP
    TO A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

           - REALLY?
             - YES.
    - SO IT WAS LAST MONTH?
             OKAY.

             - HI.
  - WE'RE SO GLAD TO HAVE YOU.
NOW WHILE YOU WERE GONE, I ASKED
 YOUR HUSBANDS THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
 TO TRY TO MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

      EACH CORRECT ANSWER

         SO HERE WE GO.
  LADIES, OUR FIRST QUESTION.

  IF YOUR HUSBAND WAS ABOUT TO
HAVE THE LAST MEAL OF HIS LIFE,
  WHO DID HE SAY HE WOULD WANT
          TO COOK IT--
        HIS MOTHER, YOU,

          OR THE CHEF
  AT HIS FAVORITE RESTAURANT?
           BRITTANY.
 - HE WOULD PROBABLY SAY ME...
           - MM-HMM.

      - BECAUSE I DO COOK
         FOR HIM OFTEN.
    MY SISTER COOKS FOR HIM,

   HE SAID IT WOULD HAVE BEEN

      STORY, 'CAUSE SHE--
    HE LOVED THE THANKSGIV--

             OKAY.

         - YES, MM-HMM.
       - CONGRATULATIONS.
          - THANK YOU.
          - ALL RIGHT,
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       THE COW SAYS MOO,
      THE DUCK SAYS QUACK,
     AND MY WIFE DURING SEX
         SAYS "BLANK."

            ALLYSON.
          - [giggles]
         UM, "OH, GOD."

          - "OH, GOD."
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, ANTHONY?
             "WOW!"
         - "WOW." OKAY.
      - DO YOU SAY "WOW"?
         - SURE, YEAH.

     IT WAS A GOOD ANSWER.

    SO I ASKED YOUR HUSBAND
        TO TELL ME ABOUT
       THE LAST TIME YOU
         BLEW HIM AWAY
    WITH AN EROTIC SURPRISE.

   WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID?
             ERICA.
 - THE BIGGEST EROTIC SURPRISE
     WAS FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

         IT WAS A, UH--
 I PLANNED A SCAVENGER HUNT...
             - AHH.
     - AND IT INVOLVED, UM,
            OUTFITS.

     - HE WAS KIND OF LIKE
    A G.I. TYPE CAMOUFLAGE.
             - OHH.
 - UH, AND I WAS A SCHOOLGIRL.

  - AND YOU WERE A SCHOOLGIRL.
           - MM-HMM.
     - SO HE WAS SEARCHING
      THROUGH THE JUNGLES
    TO FIND HIS SCHOOLGIRL.
     - EXACTLY. [laughing]

        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      SEXY SCAVENGER HUNT.
          - YAY! MWAH!

           ABOUT IT,

             - OHH.
      - FOR THAT SURPRISE.

  I REMEMBER THE DAY MY DOCTOR
  TOLD ME I HAVE AN IRREGULARR
           HEARTBEAT,
 AND THAT IT PUT ME AT 5-TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE.

         I WAS WORRIED.
    I WORRIED ABOUT MY WIFE,
         AND MY FAMILY.
BILL HAS THE MOST
COMMON TYPE OF ATRIAL
FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.

IT'S NOT CAUSED BY
A HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
         HE WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
             BUT I'VE PUT HIM ON
               PRADAXA INSTEAD.
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA 150
  MGS REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%

   MORE THAN WARFARIN WITHOUT
   THE NEED FOR REGULAR BLOOD
             TESTS.
 I SURE WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT.
  PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING. DON'T
    TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU HAVE
  ABNORMAL BLEEDING, AND SEEK
           IMMEDIATE

  MEDICAL CARE FOR UNEXPECTED
       SIGNS OF BLEEDING,
     LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
PRADAXA MAY INCREASE YOUR
 BLEEDING RISK IF YOU'RE 75 OR
             OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
     LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,

  OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS, OR
 BLOODTHINNERS, OR IF YOU HAVE
        KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
 ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE CERTAIN
           MEDICINES.
   TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ALL
MEDICINES YOU TAKE, ANY PLANNED
 MEDICAL OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,

 AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,
    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
       YOUR STROKE RISK.
   OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE

    - OKAY, I'M GOING TO SAY
        JAKE GYLLENHAAL.

             - MM.
     - AND THE ONLY REASON
     I'M GOING TO SAY THAT
 IS BECAUSE HIS FAVORITE MOVIE

      IS <i>DONNIE DARKO... </i>
            <i>- OKAY.</i>
  - AND, UM, HE HAS THE TATTOO

 HE WOULD SAY JAKE GYLLENHAAL.

        A SPORTS PERSON.
  HE'S AN EAGLES FAN, SO I HAD
   TO PICK AN EAGLES PLAYER,
   A CURRENT EAGLES PLAYER--
  I'M GONNA PICK MICHAEL VICK.

        - MICHAEL VICK.
           ALL RIGHT.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
   IF I ASKED YOUR NEIGHBORS
      WHAT THEY HATE MOST

 ABOUT LIVING NEXT DOOR TO YOU,
      WHAT WOULD THEY SAY?
            ALLYSON.
          - THE NOISE.
          - THE NOISE?

            - YEAH.
          - FROM WHAT?
 - AS EVERYBODY WOULD PROBABLY
        "GET THEIR MINDS
      OUT OF THE GUTTER,"

   UM, WE--WE SOMETIMES HAVE
   SOME LATE-NIGHT GATHERINGS
         AT OUR HOUSE,
 'CAUSE WE ACTUALLY LIVE AROUND
  THE BLOCK FROM A CLUB, SO--

    - AND SO THEY ALL COME--
  - SO OUR FRIENDS DON'T DRINK
 AND DRIVE, WE LET PEOPLE COME
 BACK TO OUR HOUSE AFTERWARDS,
  AND UNWIND BEFORE, YOU KNOW,
  THEY SHOULD DRIVE, SO, YEAH.

- SO YOU GOT AN AFTER-HOURS CLUB
      IN YOUR LIVING ROOM?
   - WE HAVE AN AFTER--YEAH,
WE HAVE CLUB COUCH AT OUR HOUSE.
       - ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
       - YEAH, YEP, SO...

            - ERICA.
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
        WITH NOISE ALSO.
     UM, I HAVE A DAY CARE,
        AND SO OUR HOUSE

        IS FULL OF KIDS
        24 HOURS A DAY.
            - OKAY.
           BRITTANY.
   - UH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
         WITH OUR DOGS.

 THE LADY THAT LIVES DOWNSTAIRS
   FROM US CANNOT STAND THEM.
    SHE HATES THE FACT THAT
THEY GO TO THE RESTROOM AT ALL,
WHICH, THEY'RE--THEY'RE ANIMALS,
         THEY HAVE TO.

BUT YEAH, SO I WOULD DEFINITELY
         SAY OUR DOGS.
        SHE HATES THEM.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.

 IN WHAT AREA HAS YOUR HUSBAND
         IMPROVED MOST
        SINCE YOU FIRST
        STARTED DATING--
       HOUSEHOLD CHORES,
      FAMILY OBLIGATIONS,

  OR BEDROOM RESPONSIBILITIES?
             ERICA.
     - FAMILY OBLIGATIONS.
           - UH-HUH.
          - 'CAUSE...

   WELL, WE JUST HAD A BABY.
           - MM-HMM.
- AND SO NOW HE'S HAD TO BECOME,
      YOU KNOW, A FATHER,
        AND TAKE ON MORE
       RESPONSIBILITIES,

       SO I'M GONNA HAVE
        TO GO WITH THAT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
           BRITTANY.
     - I WOULD SAY BEDROOM.

     HE WAS AMAZING BEFORE,
         BUT TOGETHER,
    WE ARE WAY MORE AMAZING.
            - YEAH.
           - ALLYSON.

       - UM, I'M GONNA GO
     WITH HOUSEHOLD CHORES.
  HE ACTUALLY CLEANS THE HOUSE
WITHOUT ME HAVING TO ASK, SO...
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.

          - LUCKY YOU.
  - WHAT'D YOU DO TO GET THAT?
            I KNOW.
     - YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

  IT BELONGS IN AN ART MUSEUM,
    WHILE HIS "BLANK" SHOULD
   PROBABLY BE IN A PAWNSHOP.
           BRITTANY.

          - OKAY, UH,
        MY HUSBAND'S...
 NETHER REGIONS ARE SO GREAT...
        - [laughs] YES.

   GOES TO THE GYM EVERY DAY,
  AND I'M GONNA GO WITH TEETH.
   - AND HIS TEETH SHOULD BE

    - SO SHOULD MINE, SO...
        - [laughs] OKAY.
             ERICA.
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO

   HE WORKS OUT CONSTANTLY...
            - OKAY.
   - AND HIS FEET NEED TO GO
        TO THE PAWNSHOP.
 - WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIS FEET?

      - WELL, I DON'T LIKE
         FEET, PERIOD,
         UM, BUT HIS--
 - YOU DON'T LIKE FEET, PERIOD?
    - NO, I DON'T LIKE FEET,

        STARTED DATING--
      FAMILY OBLIGATIONS,
       HOUSEHOLD CHORES,
  OR BEDROOM RESPONSIBILITIES?

            MICHAEL.
 - MY BEDROOM RESPONSIBILITIES
       ARE REALLY GOOD...
            - OKAY.
         - BUT I'LL SAY

      FAMILY OBLIGATIONS,
  BECAUSE WHEN WE GOT MARRIED,
   SHE HAD--I HAVE A STEPSON,
A STEPDAUGHTER I LOVE VERY MUCH,
   AND I WASN'T USED TO THAT,
       SO I CAME INTO IT,

        SO I HAVE TO SAY

   BUT I DIDN'T SAY YOU IMP--
        I SAID YOU WERE
        ALREADY AMAZING,

   WE WERE EVEN MORE AMAZING.

   - WELL, THAT'S JUST SILLY.

    - I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
        TO ADD TO THAT.

      FAMILY OBLIGATIONS.

     - FAMILY OBLIGATIONS?
           ALL RIGHT,
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, ALLYSON?
      - HOUSEHOLD CHORES.

 - YOU CLEAN. YOU ALWAYS CLEAN.

       I'M GOOD AT THAT.

     - BUT YOU GOT BETTER.
           - [laughs]

    THANK YOU FOR WATCHING

        - THIS IS CARLA.
      SHE'S GOT A SECRET,
        AND IT'S HIDDEN
      INSIDE THIS RED BAG.

 DID SHE FAKE BEING A WAITRESS
         TO STEAL TIPS?
         DID SHE SLEEP
      WITH AN EX'S BROTHER
  AND THEN LEAVE THE COUNTRY?

        OR DOES SHE HAVE
     3 EXES' SPERM SAMPLES
        IN HER FREEZER?
     WE'LL UNLOCK THIS BAG
      AND A WHOLE LOT MORE

     COMING UP ON <i>BAGGAGE.</i>

    HI, I'M JERRY SPRINGER,
     AND WELCOME TO <i>BAGGAGE</i>
      WHERE SINGLES EXPOSE
 THEIR MOST OUTRAGEOUS SECRETS
    FOR A CHANCE AT ROMANCE.
 CARLA, TELL US ABOUT YOURSELF.

   - WELL, I AM FROM RECIFE,
 A LITTLE SMALL TOWN IN BRAZIL.
          - OOH, OKAY.
- AND I HAVE THREE BOXERS THAT I
  HIKE EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH,

      AND IT'S JUST LIKE,
  WHOO, IT'S SUCH A BLESSING.
     - AND WHAT KIND OF GUY
      ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
 - WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR A GUY
       THAT'S RESPONSIBLE

AND THAT ADORE KIDS AND THAT...
            - YEAH.
- IS VERY TOO MUCH INTO SPORTS--
       YOU KNOW, SURFING,
  SNOWBOARDING, WAKEBOARDING.

     [cheers and applause]
            - OKAY.
WELL, I CAN TELL YOU, WE'VE GOT
 THREE GOOD-LOOKING GUYS HERE.
   DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT 'EM,
          BUT THEY DID

      BRING THEIR BAGGAGE,
       READY TO MEET 'EM?
          - ALL RIGHT.
         - LET'S DO IT.
    HE'S A MASSAGE THERAPIST
     FROM ONTARIO, CANADA,

       SAY HELLO TO JAY.
     [cheers and applause]
   - HEY, CARLA. I'M A FUNNY,
    SMART, AND OUTGOING GUY

  WHO TAKES LIFE BY THE HORNS.
     I ALSO REALLY BELIEVE
         IN PAST LIVES,
     AND I LOVE CEMETERIES,
    SO IF YOU STICK WITH ME,

      YOU'LL DIE LAUGHING.
            [laughs]
     - ALL RIGHT, UP NEXT,
 HE'S A CONCIERGE FROM CHICAGO.
     GIVE IT UP FOR PETER.

     [cheers and applause]
          - HI, CARLA.
      I'M AN OUTGOING GUY.
   I LIKE SURFING AND HIKING.
    AND I ALSO LIKE TO PLAY
  THE PIANO AND SING KARAOKE.

      SO IF YOU CHOOSE ME,
 WE CAN MAKE A SWEET SOUNDTRACK
       TO THE ADVENTURES
        THAT LIE AHEAD.
       - OOH. I LIKE IT.

- AND FINALLY, HE'S AN EDUCATOR
   FROM GREENVILLE, MICHIGAN.
   LET'S HEAR IT FOR RICHARD.
     [cheers and applause]
         - HEY, CARLA.

     I'M A PASSIONATE GUY.
       I LOVE ROAD TRIPS
      AND PLAYING GUITAR.
          SO PICK ME,

     AND I'LL SERENADE YOU
 ON THE ROAD TRIP OF OUR LIFE.
            - WHOO.
              WOW.
    - WELL, AS YOU CAN SEE,

  THESE GUYS BROUGHT A SMALL,
   MEDIUM, AND LARGE BAGGAGE
     HIDING AN UNBELIEVABLE
        PERSONAL SECRET
      TO HELP CARLA DECIDE
 WHO SHE'S CHOOSING FOR A DATE.

   GENTLEMEN, IT IS NOW TIME
           TO UNCOVER
YOUR SMALLEST PIECE OF BAGGAGE.
     LET'S START WITH JAY.

             - OOH.
          I THINK THAT
    YOU'RE NOT OPEN-MINDED.
   I GO WITH MY GUT INSTINCT.

I DON'T NEED A STAR LINE TO SHOW
 ME WHO'S RIGHT OR WRONG, SO...
 - WELL, YOU KNOW, IN THE PAST,
 I'VE DATED WOMEN WHO HAVE NOT
  BEEN ALIGNED WITH MY CHART,

  AND IT HASN'T GONE SO WELL,
    SO NOW I WOULD JUST LOVE
    TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT,
   YOU KNOW, WITH MY PERSONAL
    ASTROLOGER AND MAKE SURE

        THAT OUR STARS,
       MOONS ARE ALIGNED,
         AND WE'LL HAVE
       A FUTURE TOGETHER.
    I REALLY BELIEVE IN IT.
           IT WORKS.

            - PETER.
       WELL, LET ME SEE--
       GIRLFRIEND, CUBS.

   WELL, THE CUBS ARE EASIER
          TO SCORE ON.
            - OKAY.
      - I LIKE THE SPORTS,
  BUT I LIKE THE DOING MATTER,

      NOT WATCHING MATTER.
    I WANT TO BE NUMBER ONE,
        NOT NUMBER TWO.
 - THE THING IS, WITH THE CUBS,

    THERE'S A LOT MORE DOWNS
      THAN THERE ARE UPS,
 BUT I LOVE 'EM JUST THE SAME.
 SO I'M HOPING THERE'S GONNA BE
     A LOT OF FUN WITH US,

   BUT EVEN IN THE BAD TIMES,
 I'LL STILL LOVE 'EM THE SAME.
           - RICHARD.
    - WELL, I'M FROM BRAZIL,

AND STYLE IS A NUMBER ONE THING
         FOR US GIRLS,
   AND SO I DON'T WANT TO BE
     EMBARRASSED IN PUBLIC.
    - PERSONALLY, YOU KNOW,
     I JUST, I REALLY LIKE

     TO BE LOUNGING AROUND.
     THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM
     TO HAVE THE SOCKS ON.
  IF I'VE GOTTA RUN SOMEPLACE,

         THE THING YOU
      CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON
     IS THAT IF YOU NEED ME
TO GET SOMETHING FROM THE STORE,
YOUR NEEDS ARE GONNA COME FIRST
    BEFORE MY FASHION SENSE.

             - OOH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
WELL, UP NEXT, CARLA THROWS ONE
OF THE GUY'S BAGS UNDER THE BUS.
FIND OUT WHO WHEN WE COME BACK.

       YOU KNOW WHO'S GOT
       A LOT OF BAGGAGE?
       GSNTV.com/BAGGAGE.
    LOG ON AND CHECK IT OUT.
         MY NAME IS JANE
   AND I'VE GOT OSTEOPOROSIS.

   BUT I'M AN ON THE GO WOMAN.
  I'VE BEEN ACTIVE ALL MY LIFE.
     THAT'S WHY I'M EXCITED
         ABOUT RECLAST.

      IT'S THE ONCE-A-YEAR
   IV OSTEOPOROSIS TREATMENT.
          RECLAST HELPS
    TO RESTRENGTHEN MY BONES
   TO HELP MAKE THEM RESISTANT
          TO FRACTURE.

     AND WITH RECLAST, WELL,
 NO OTHER OSTEOPOROSIS TREATMENT

    NOW EARLIER, WE REVEALED
    THE MEN'S SMALLEST BAGS.
         WE'VE GOT JAY,
      WHO ONLY DATES WOMEN
          ALIGNED WITH
     HIS ASTROLOGICAL SIGN,

    PETER, WHOSE GIRLFRIEND
    WILL NEVER COME BETWEEN
   HIM AND THE CHICAGO CUBS,
     AND RICHARD, WHO LOVES
  TO ROCK SOCKS WITH SANDALS.

        WELL, IT'S TIME
  FOR THE DEAL-BREAKER ROUND.
 NOW WE'VE GOT THREE MORE BAGS.
THIS TIME, WE'VE PLACED 'EM HERE
        IN RANDOM ORDER.

     NOW WHEN CARLA DECIDES
WHICH BAG IS TOO HEAVY TO CARRY,
        WELL, THE OWNER
    OF THAT PARTICULAR BAG
      WILL BE GOING HOME.

    IT IS TIME NOW TO SHARE
         MORE BAGGAGE.
        BAG NUMBER ONE.
   IF I WANT TO LOOK YOUNGER,
      I GO ON <i>LARRY KING.</i>

           - [laughs]
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
       - BAG NUMBER TWO.
    I TRIED THAT LAST WEEK,

    AND THEN THEY KICKED ME
       OUT OF THE STUDIO.
       BAG NUMBER THREE.
   I FIND IT SMOOTHER IF YOU
 TAKE IT OUT OF THE CAN FIRST.

  ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO THROUGH
  THESE BAGS ONE AT A TIME...
   - THAT'S JUST DISGUSTING.
          I MEAN, IT'S
     A HUGE HEALTH ISSUE...

            - YEAH.
          - YOU KNOW?
    AND SPITTING EVERYWHERE?
            MM, NO.
  WELL, I DO NOT WANT TO LOOK
   AT THAT EVERY SINGLE DAY.

      AS LONG AS YOU DO IT
      IN A PRIVATE SPACE,
 OKAY, BUT IF YOU'RE DOING IT,
          FOR EXAMPLE,
         IN THE STUDIO,

 I DON'T WANT TO SHARE MY MAN'S
    BUTT WITH ANYBODY ELSE.
            MNH-MNH.
        WOW, THAT MEANS
     YOU'RE A VERY SHALLOW,

       VAIN KIND OF MAN,
  AND I CANNOT DEAL WITH THAT.
      - ALL RIGHT, CARLA,
         NOW IT IS TIME
       FOR YOU TO TELL US

         WHICH OF THESE
     IS YOUR DEAL-BREAKER.
     [indistinct shouting]
      - MY DEAL-BREAKER IS

    I CHEW 2 TINS OF TOBACCO
            A WEEK.
             - OOH.
     GENTLEMEN, IT IS TIME
     TO CLAIM YOUR BAGGAGE.

             - OH!
             - OH.
              OHH.
            OH, OHH.

   PETER, TELL US ABOUT THAT.
     - WELL, IT'S SOMETHING
    I PICKED UP IN COLLEGE,
    DID IT WITH MY FRIENDS.
    YOU DID, TOO, YOU KNOW,

      GET A BUZZ AND RELAX
     AND HAVE A GOOD TIME.
     AND, UH, I WAS HOPING
      YOU'D REPLACE THAT,
BECAUSE JUST BY LOOKING AT YOU,

      I COULD GET A BUZZ,
        AND I FEEL GOOD.
         - WELL, I LIKE
    THAT YOU'RE INTO SPORTS,
     AND I SEE THAT YOU'RE
    A VERY GOOD-LOOKING MAN,

  UM, AND LOOKING SMART, TOO.
       BUT NOT TOO SMART
       ABOUT YOUR HEALTH,
AND SO I CANNOT DEAL WITH THAT.

- OKAY, WELL, I'M SORRY, PETER,
         BUT IT IS TIME
       TO PACK UP AND GO.
            all: AW.

- WELL, AT LEAST I KNOW THE CUBS
  WILL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR ME.
        - OH, ALL RIGHT,
     WELL, TWO MEN REMAIN.
WE'VE GOT RICHARD WHO PRACTICES
     NAKED YOGA EVERY DAY,

AND JAY, WHO SPENDS $400 A MONTH
        TO LOOK YOUNGER.
   GENTLEMEN, PLEASE JOIN US
     OVER ON THE HOT SEAT.
  - CARLA, THIS IS MY BIGGEST
       PIECE OF BAGGAGE.

     WHEN I'M OUT WITH YOU,
   I WILL ALWAYS BE THINKING
           OF MY EX.
      WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
   I'LL HAVE A LOT MORE TIME

      TO THINK ABOUT HER.
- WELL, WELCOME TO THE HOT SEAT
       WHERE THE GUYS SAY
 EXACTLY WHAT'S ON THEIR MIND.

  NOW JAY SPENDS $400 A MONTH
        TO LOOK YOUNGER.
RICHARD, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS
          ABOUT THAT?
 - I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY SOMEBODY
  WOULD NEED TO LOOK YOUNGER.

YOUTHFULNESS IS A STATE OF MIND.
 SECOND OF ALL, $400 A MONTH--
      THAT'S ABOUT 5 GRAND

 THAT I'D PUT INTO AN ADVENTURE
      ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
    SOMETHING TO EXPERIENCE
        WITH YOU, CARLA.
      - AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
    I WAS A REALLY SICK KID.

AND I'VE BECOME SUPER PASSIONATE
 ABOUT TAKING CARE OF MY HEALTH
     ON THE INSIDE AND OUT.
 I'M 64 YEARS OLD, BY THE WAY.

   AND I WOULD TOTALLY SHARE
  MY PRODUCTS WITH YOU, CARLA.
    - NOW RICHARD PRACTICES
     NAKED YOGA EVERY DAY.
     JAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
          ABOUT THAT?

     - OKAY, FIRST OF ALL,
 WOULD YOU WANT TO LOOK AT THIS
    BARE BUTT EVERY MORNING?
         I DON'T KNOW.
        I'M JUST SAYING.

 AND SECOND OF ALL, IN A CLASS
WITH A LOT OF OTHER NAKED WOMEN,
 ARE YOU COMFORTABLE WITH THAT?
  - I REALLY LIKE TO STRETCH,

   AND SOMETIMES, THE CLOTHES
       CAN GET IN MY WAY,
        SO IT'S A REALLY
     LIBERATING EXPERIENCE.
       I DO IT ON MY OWN.

AND YOU CAN KNOW THAT I'M GONNA
   BE COMFORTABLE WITH MYSELF
      AND WITH YOU ALWAYS.
    - ALL RIGHT, WELL, GUYS,
  IT IS TIME FOR CARLA TO GET
TO KNOW YOU A LITTLE BIT BETTER,

 SO WE'RE GONNA START WITH JAY.
        JAY, PLEASE STEP
       INTO THE HOT SPOT.
  AND GIVE ME THE FIRST ANSWER
   THAT COMES TO MIND, OKAY?

    NOW CARLA LOVES DESSERT.
 IF YOU WERE HER SEXUAL TREAT,
         WHICH TOPPING
     WOULD YOU PUT ON YOU,

 AND WHAT WOULD YOU BE CALLED--
    STRAWBERRIES, CHOCOLATE,
       OR WHIPPED CREAM?
- CHOCOLATE, BECAUSE IT'S RICH,
     CREAMY, AND DELICIOUS.

           I CALL IT
  THE "CARLA AND JAY SUNDAE."
            - WHOO.
             NICE.

    - FINISH THIS SENTENCE,
       AND TELL US WHY--
 "IF A WOMAN WANTS TO KEEP ME,
        SHE NEEDS TO..."
     - GIVE ME SOME SPACE.

    I LOVE MY INDEPENDENCE,
AND I LOVE AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN.
- FRIENDS CALL CARLA "SUNSHINE,"
BECAUSE HER GLOWING PERSONALITY
       LIGHTS UP A ROOM.

 WELL, WHAT DO YOUR FRIENDS SAY
ABOUT YOU WHEN YOU ENTER A ROOM?
 - I AM THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.
            - CARLA
   HAS DOUBLE-JOINTED THUMBS.

  WHAT UNIQUE PHYSICAL FEATURE
        DO YOU POSSESS,
  AND WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH IT?
    - MY SPECIAL NOSE TRICK.

     - CARLA, TELL JAY WHAT
  YOU THOUGHT OF HIS ANSWERS.
         - I LIKED 'EM.
    YOU'RE VERY HONEST ABOUT
  HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT YOURSELF,

  AND I LIKE THAT ABOUT A MAN.
      YOU SHOW CONFIDENCE.
   AND, UM, I LIKE TO PARTY,
   SO I LIKE THAT ABOUT YOU.

  - ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, JAY.
      RICHARD, PLEASE STEP
       INTO THE HOT SPOT.
    GIVE ME THE FIRST ANSWER
      THAT COMES TO MIND.

  IF YOU COULD BE A CHARACTER
         ON A TV SHOW,
WHICH CAST WOULD YOU FIT IN WITH
           AND WHY--
        <i>GLEE, THE OFFICE,</i>
          <i>OR</i> <i>HOARDERS?</i>

   - I'M GONNA GO WITH <i>GLEE.</i>
    I'M A PASSIONATE SINGER,
     AND I'D BE ABLE TO GET
      ALL OF MY HEART OUT
     AND EXPRESS IT TO YOU.

             - OOH.
  - WHAT ACTIVITY DO YOU FIND
  ALMOST AS SATISFYING AS SEX?
        - PLAYING GUITAR
       AROUND A CAMPFIRE.

IT'S A REALLY, REALLY GREAT WAY
TO CONNECT ON AN INTIMATE LEVEL
    WITH PEOPLE THAT I LOVE.
    - FINISH THIS SENTENCE,
       AND TELL US WHY--

      "I AM THE BEST BLANK
       YOU'LL EVER MEET."
    - I AM THE BEST LISTENER
       YOU'LL EVER MEET,
  BECAUSE "LISTEN" COMES FROM

   THE GREEK <i>LISTOS,</i> TO OBEY,
     AND I SHALL OBEY YOU.
             - WOW.

- CARLA LOVES TO SHAKE HER HIPS
      ON THE DANCE FLOOR.
          IMPRESS HER
  WITH YOUR SEXY SALSA MOVES.
         [salsa music]

          - THANK YOU.
          - ALL RIGHT.
UH, CARLA, TELL RICHARD WHAT YOU
    THOUGHT OF HIS ANSWERS.
       - I LIKE ABOUT YOU

   THAT YOU'RE VERY OUTGOING.
       YOU'RE A LISTENER.
 IT'S REALLY HARD TO FIND THAT
           IN A MAN.

    SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT
           ABOUT YOU.
          - VERY GOOD.
           ALL RIGHT.
      THANK YOU, RICHARD.

ALL RIGHT, CARLA, DON'T MAKE UP
      YOUR MIND JUST YET,
    BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
JAY AND RICHARD'S BIGGEST BAGS,
   AND THAT MIGHT TURN THINGS
          UPSIDE DOWN.

       AND DON'T FORGET,
  CARLA HAS SOME BAGGAGE, TOO.
 DID SHE FAKE BEING A WAITRESS
         TO STEAL TIPS?

         DID SHE SLEEP
      WITH AN EX'S BROTHER
  AND THEN LEAVE THE COUNTRY?
        OR DOES SHE HAVE
     3 EXES' SPERM SAMPLES

        IN HER FREEZER?

 BUT LOVES DOWNWARD DOGGY STYLE
        WITHOUT CLOTHES?
GENTLEMEN, IT IS TIME TO SHOW US

 YOUR BIGGEST PIECE OF BAGGAGE.
              JAY.
             - WOW.
            - YEAH.

          - WOW, WOW.
        - I WANT SOMEONE
      THAT COMMITS TO ME,
SO THAT SCARES ME THAT YOU, UM,

     HAVE ONE-NIGHT STANDS.
  ARE YOU GONNA USE ME FOR MY
  LOOKS FOR A ONE-NIGHT STAND?
        [clicks tongue]
           NOT COOL.

- NO, IT'S JUST I'VE BEEN SINGLE
     FOR A VERY LONG TIME,
  AND I FIND ONE-NIGHT STANDS
A GREAT WAY TO GET THE INTIMACY
    WITHOUT THE COMMITMENT,

    BUT I AM TOTALLY LOOKING
       FOR A COMMITMENT,
AND I WOULD GLADLY GIVE ALL THAT
    UP WHEN WE GO ON A DATE.
     - OH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

     RICHARD, PLEASE REVEAL
         YOUR BAGGAGE.
             - WOW.
         IT SEEMS LIKE
    YOU'RE NOT STICKING WITH

     YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES,
 AND THAT, IN A MAN, IS A MUST.
     I'M LOOKING FOR A MAN
       THAT HAS AMBITION

   AND HAS A HOUSE AND A CAR
           AND A JOB.
  - WHAT ABOUT THAT, RICHARD?
            - WELL,
 I WRITE SONGS OF EMPOWERMENT,

  AND I'VE LIVED SOME TRIALS,
      AND THAT'S HELPED ME
     TO BE A BETTER WRITER.
       IT'S NOT THE BEST,
      MOST GLAMOROUS JOB,

      BUT I DO KEEP A ROOF
         OVER MY HEAD,
 AND I'VE LEARNED TO LIVE EVERY
  DAY LIKE IT'S MY FIRST DAY,
        SO YOU CAN TRUST
     THAT OUR RELATIONSHIP

   WILL ALWAYS BE VERY FRESH.
     - ALL RIGHT, NOW, JAY,
           TELL CARLA
   WHY SHE SHOULD CHOOSE YOU
        AND NOT RICHARD.

     - I'M A SUPER HONEST,
          RESPECTFUL,
AND SUCCESSFUL GUY, MIGHT I ADD,
 WHO WOULD TREAT YOU LIKE GOLD,
       AND DO YOU REALLY
    WANT TO GO TO McDONALD'S

       ON YOUR FIRST DATE
  OR BE PICKED UP BY HIS BIKE?
 - NOW, RICHARD, YOU TELL CARLA
   WHY SHE SHOULD CHOOSE YOU
          AND NOT JAY.

      - I TRULY AM DRIVEN
     AND COMMITTED, CARLA,
     AND I LOVE WHAT I DO.
    - WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING?

   - UH, YOU KNOW, I'M--I'M--
     I'M REALLY GONNA HAVE
     A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU.
    I KNOW THAT WE'RE GONNA
       HAVE A GREAT TIME.

    AND WHAT I'VE GOTTA SAY
       IS THAT, YOU KNOW,
 THERE ARE SOME THINGS THAT WE
   CAN WORK THROUGH TOGETHER,
 BUT YOU'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE
  TO WORK THROUGH INFIDELITY.

          - ALL RIGHT,
      IT'S TIME TO CHOOSE.
        WILL IT BE JAY,
      WHO ONLY DATES WOMEN
          ALIGNED WITH
     HIS ASTROLOGICAL SIGN,

      SPENDS $400 A MONTH
        TO LOOK YOUNGER,
      AND NO LONGER DATES,
 HE JUST HAS ONE-NIGHT STANDS?
     OR WILL IT BE RICHARD

           WHO LOVES
  TO ROCK SOCKS WITH SANDALS,
PRACTICES NAKED YOGA EVERY DAY,
      AND IS A PENNILESS,
    CARLESS STREET PERFORMER

     LIVING OUT OF A HOTEL?
            - YEAH.
- NOW, CARLA, BEFORE YOU DECIDE,

   TELL EACH GUY HOW YOU FEEL
   ABOUT HIM AND HIS BAGGAGE.
     LET'S START WITH JAY.
      - WELL, JAY, I THINK
     YOU'RE VERY CONFIDENT

      ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT.
     I LIKE THAT IN A MAN.
      YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE.
 AND YOU SEEM TO BE SUPERSMART,
    AND I REALLY LIKE THAT.

      I AM KIND OF SCARED
 OF THE ONE KIND OF NIGHT STAND
         KIND OF THING
     THAT YOU HAVE IN MIND,

    AND I'M NOT ABOUT THAT,
   SO IT SCARES ME A LITTLE.
   - AND WHAT ABOUT RICHARD?
           - RICHARD,
    I THINK YOU'RE OUTGOING,

        AND YOU'RE FUN,
  AND YOU'RE A SUPERCOOL GUY,
   BUT I NEED A MAN THAT CAN
  STAND ON HIS FEET AND BUILD
     A HOUSE KIND OF THING.

   - ALL RIGHT, WELL, CARLA,
       IT IS TIME TO SEND
ONE OF THESE GENTLEMEN PACKING.
            - WELL,

      I'M SORRY, RICHARD,
   YOU HAVE TOO MUCH BAGGAGE.
             - OH.
  IT'S TIME TO PACK UP AND GO.

        - WELL, AT LEAST
   I KNOW I'LL FIND SOMEBODY
         THAT CAN SHARE
   MY PASSION AND COMMITMENT.
  - ALL RIGHT, BUT WAY TO GO,
         JAY AND CARLA.

        HOW ABOUT THAT?
       AND NOW IT'S TIME
       FOR JAY TO DECIDE
   IF HE WANTS TO BE WITH HER
   AFTER SEEING HER BIG BAG.

WILL CARLA'S BAG GET SENT HOME?
   FIND OUT RIGHT AFTER THIS.

 NOW CARLA HAS JUST CHOSEN JAY
     HERE FOR A NICE DATE,

         BUT THE SHOE'S
       ON THE OTHER FOOT,
      AND NOW, OF COURSE,
      IT IS HIS DECISION.
       WHAT'S THE SECRET

    IN CARLA'S BIG RED BAG?
 DID SHE FAKE BEING A WAITRESS
         TO STEAL TIPS?
         DID SHE SLEEP
      WITH AN EX'S BROTHER

  AND THEN LEAVE THE COUNTRY?
        OR DOES SHE HAVE
     3 EXES' SPERM SAMPLES
        IN HER FREEZER?

             - OOH.
        - JAY, OF THESE
      THREE POSSIBILITIES,
WHICH WOULD BE THE TOUGHEST ONE
   FOR YOU TO HAVE TO ACCEPT?

        - 3 EXES' SPERM
        IN THE FREEZER.
     I MEAN, FIRST OF ALL,
       I'M WONDERING WHAT
THE ATTACHMENT IS TO YOUR EXES.

           YOU KNOW,
   HAVE YOU NOT MOVED ON YET?
  AND SECOND OF ALL, YOU KNOW,
    IF OUR DATING GOES WELL
     AND WE PLAN A FAMILY,

 I HAVE ENOUGH OF THOSE MYSELF
      TO PROVIDE FOR YOU,
       SO YOU CAN GET RID
       OF THE OLD SPERM.
            - CARLA,
  PLEASE REVEAL YOUR BAGGAGE.

     AND LEFT THE COUNTRY.
     JAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK
          ABOUT THAT?
 - OKAY, WELL, MY FIRST THOUGHT

    IS I HAVE TWO BROTHERS,
         SO OF COURSE,
    I'M THINKING, YOU KNOW,
      IF I DON'T WORK OUT,
      ARE YOU GONNA SLEEP
    WITH ONE OF MY BROTHERS?

 AND IT GIVES ME THE IMPRESSION
    MAYBE YOU HAVE SOMETHING
            TO HIDE.
     I MEAN, WHY WOULD YOU
       LEAVE THE COUNTRY?

   I DON'T KNOW. I'M A LITTLE
     CONCERNED ABOUT THAT.
 - MY EX-BOYFRIEND WAS CHEATING
             ON ME.
    AND I FELT LIKE I NEEDED
       TO GET BACK TO HIM

 BY SLEEPING WITH HIS BROTHER.
      BUT, UM, I'M HOPING
 THAT YOU WON'T DO THAT TO ME,

        AND I WON'T NEED
      TO GET BACK AT YOU.
     - ALL RIGHT, SO I HAVE
      TO ASK YOU NOW, JAY,
CAN YOU ACCEPT CARLA'S BAGGAGE?

         - YEAH, CARLA,
   I CAN ACCEPT YOUR BAGGAGE.
    - WHOA, CONGRATULATIONS!
    JAY AND CARLA WILL ENJOY
    A LOVELY DINNER FOR TWO
