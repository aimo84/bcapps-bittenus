I REMEMBER THE DAYS BEFORE COPD.
          MY SON AND I
    NEVER MISSED OPENING DAY.
          BUT WITH COPD
   MAKING IT HARD TO BREATHE,

            I THOUGHT
    THOSE DAYS MIGHT BE OVER.
     SO MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED
           SYMBICORT.
 IT HELPS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE
        MY LUNG FUNCTION,

   STARTING WITHIN 5 MINUTES.
    SYMBICORT DOESN'T REPLACE

         WITH SYMBICORT,
   TODAY I'M BREATHING BETTER,
        AND THAT MEANS...
      GAME ON!

     SYMBICORT IS FOR COPD,
  INCLUDING CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
         AND EMPHYSEMA.
     IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN
     MORE THAN TWICE A DAY.

     SYMBICORT MAY INCREASE
  YOUR RISK OF LUNG INFECTIONS,
          OSTEOPOROSIS,
     AND SOME EYE PROBLEMS.
        TELL YOUR DOCTOR
  IF YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION

Steve: WHAT DO YOU DO?

>> I ACTUALLY AM A SURVIVOR. I
WAS IN A BOATING ACCIDENT WHEN I
WAS 17 YEARS OLD, SO I GOT A

SECOND SHOT AT LIFE, AND NOW I'M
LIVING LIFE TO THE FULLEST.
Steve: AND YOU BALLIN' WITH IT.

>> I DO! I DO!
Steve: YEAH, YOU BALLIN', GIRL.
THAT'S HOW YOU DO IT.

>> I DO.
