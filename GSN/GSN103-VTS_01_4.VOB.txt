  She's got a secret, and it's
  hidden inside this red bag.
      Does she have $2.17
    in her savings account?

        Did she break up
     with three boyfriends
          in one day?
        Or does she make
         her men dress

    like Barney the Dinosaur
            in bed?
    We'll rip open this bag
     and a whole lot more,
      coming up on <i>Baggage!</i>

    Hi, I'm Jerry Springer,
     and welcome to <i>Baggage,</i>

         where singles
       divulge their dirt
          for a chance
    to come clean for love.
           Right now,
     let's meet our dater.

  She's an associate creative
    director from Las Vegas.
     Please welcome Nicole.
     [cheers and applause]

    Hi, Nicole, how are you?
             - Hi.
    - Very nice to meet you.
    And what can kind of guy
      are you looking for?

    - Well, Jerry, I'm sick
     of boring, flaky guys.
          I want a guy
    who's willing to commit
         and thrill me
        in the same way.

- Well, I think we're gonna make
     you real happy today.
 I've seen the guys backstage,
       good-looking guys,
  but, you know, like everyone
  else, they got some baggage.

       Ready to meet 'em?
          - I'm ready.
 - Let's do it. He's a teacher
       from Reno, Nevada.
    Say hello to Nathaniel.

     [cheers and applause]
         - Hey, Nicole.
        I am a drummer.
     So if you want to make
     some beautiful music,

     I will be right here.
        - There you go.
    Up next, he's a student
   from Ann Arbor, Michigan.

         Show some love
          for Matthew.
     [cheers and applause]
 - They say ignorance is bliss,

  but I'd be a fool not to get
   to know a woman like you.
           - [laughs]
             - Oh.
          - All right.
    - Already making a move.

          And finally,
   he's a business consultant
   from Coronado, California.
       Say hello to Leo.

     [cheers and applause]
   - How's it going, Nicole?
        My name is Leo.
 I'm a business-minded surfer,
   and I know I can give you

         the adventure
      you're looking for.
           - [laughs]
  - All right, our three guys
      brought their small,

    medium, and large bags,
 each holding a peculiar secret
that, frankly, gets more amazing
         with each bag.
 This way, Nicole can determine
     in just a few minutes

    who she'd like to date.
           Gentlemen,
      it is time to reveal
      your smallest piece
          of baggage.
