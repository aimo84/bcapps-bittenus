     THE MOST ROMANTIC CITY
         IN THE WORLD,

    HERE COME THE NEWLYWEDS.
 AND NOW THE WOMAN WHO HANDLES
CUPID'S ARROW, SHERRI SHEPHERD.
  Captioning provided by GSN.

          - HELLO. HI.
      HEY, EVERYBODY. HEY.
             HELLO!

     OKAY. THANK YOU, GARY.
            WELCOME
      TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>
       THE SHOW THAT GETS
  TO THE HEART OF THE MARRIAGE

      BY BARING ITS BOOTY.
     ALL RIGHT. AND WE HAVE
THREE NEW COUPLES RARING TO GO.
        LET'S MEET THEM.

     - SHERRI, MEET COUPLE
 NUMBER ONE, DINO AND LINDSAY.
    THEY PREFER THE BACKSEAT
 OF THEIR CAR TO THEIR BEDROOM.
  THEY ALSO ENJOY AN AUDIENCE.

      GUESS WHO'S HOSTING
     NEXT YEAR'S AUTO SHOW
       IN THEIR DRIVEWAY.
     AND COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
       FRANK AND EILEENA.

   HE'S A PROFESSIONAL BOXER.
     SHE LIKES TO ROLE-PLAY
     AS HIS RING CARD GIRL.
YOU KNOW THAT RULE ABOUT KEEPING
       IT ABOVE THE BELT?

          APPARENTLY,
        NEITHER DO THEY.
    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
      BILLY AND CAROLINE,
        DECIDED TO SLEEP
    THEIR WAY AROUND EUROPE.

  WITH EACH OTHER, OF COURSE.
    THEY HIT SEVEN COUNTRIES
           IN TOTAL.
THEY PLAN TO CHECK OFF THE REST
   BY THEIR 50TH ANNIVERSARY.

      BACK TO YOU, SHERRI.
    - OH, THAT'S NICE. OKAY.
 NOW THAT'S A REALLY GOOD GOAL
            TO HAVE.
I HEARD YOU TWO HAD A MEMORABLE
      ENCOUNTER IN VENICE.

         WHAT HAPPENED?
     - WE HAD JUST ARRIVED
           IN VENICE.
       AND IT WAS SO HOT.

  ANYBODY WHO'S BEEN TO VENICE
          KNOWS THAT.
        AIR CONDITIONER
         FELT SO GOOD.
    CAROLINE DECIDED TO TAKE
    ALL OF HER CLOTHES OFF.

         AND I HAPPENED
       TO SEE A MOSQUITO.
     - AND I AM SO ALLERGIC
         TO MOSQUITOES
   SO I STARTED FREAKING OUT.

    AND I'M SWINGING AT IT.
     I'M JUMPING ON THE BED
       TRYING TO GET IT.
       AND THE NIGHTSTAND
 GOES FLYING UP AS WELL AS ME.

           AND I LAND
     ON THE GLASS TABLETOP
   WITH GLASS ALL IN MY BACK.
  AND HE GOES, "BABE, REALLY?

     "WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN
  IN THE ROOM FOR TEN MINUTES
     AND YOU ALREADY BROKE
          SOMETHING."
 - BUT AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU GOT
   THIS NICE, BIG, STRONG MAN

      TO TAKE CARE OF YOU?
            - YEAH.
     - YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
    WELL, WELCOME, COUPLES.
    GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU.

  AND, YOU KNOW WHAT, LADIES,
     WHY DON'T YOU GET UP,
       HEAD ON BACKSTAGE?
   BECAUSE WE GOT TO ASK YOUR
    HUSBANDS SOME QUESTIONS.

         THERE YOU GO.
     OKAY, GUYS, I'M GOING
  TO ASK YOU THREE QUESTIONS.
      AND IT'S GONNA BE UP
         TO YOUR WIVES

     TO MATCH YOUR ANSWERS.
           THE COUPLE
      WITH THE MOST POINTS
     AT THE END OF THE GAME

      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
       SECOND HONEYMOON.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
        YOU READY TO GO?
            - READY.
  - ALL RIGHT. FIRST QUESTION.

         WHEN YOU LOOK
     AT YOUR WIFE'S CHEST,
   DOES IT LOOK STRAIGHT BACK
       AT YOU, LOOK DOWN,
         OR GLANCE OFF
    IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS?

     DINO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
     - SHERRI, I WOULD HAVE
             TO SAY
   THEY LOOK DIRECTLY AT ME.

  - THEY LOOK DIRECTLY AT YOU?
   - DEFINITELY. DEFINITELY.
      - AND WHEN THEY LOOK
        STRAIGHT AT YOU,
       WHAT DO THEY SAY?

          - HI, DINO.
           - [laughs]
  OKAY, WHAT ABOUT YOU, FRANK?
        - UM, HONESTLY,
  THEY'RE LOOKING DEAD AT ME.

   HONESTLY. THEY'RE LOOKING
          RIGHT AT ME.
  AND, UH, THEY'RE TELLING ME
          "MOTORBOAT."
          - MOTORBOAT?
 IS THAT A TERM YOU GUYS HAVE?

          - YES. YEAH.
  WHAT DOES "MOTORBOAT" MEAN?
  - JUST, UH, SUFFOCATE MYSELF
       IN THEM. [laughs]

     - SUFFOCATE YOURSELF.
      DON'T KILL YOURSELF,
    BUT SUFFOCATE YOURSELF.
           I LOVE IT.
     BILLY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - I'D HAVE TO SAY
        THE SAME THING.
        THEY'RE LOOKING
       RIGHT BACK AT ME.
     SHE'S A LITTLE SMALLER
            UP TOP.

    BUT SHE MAKES UP FOR IT
          IN THE BACK.
      - THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
        SECOND QUESTION.

 WHAT ONE THING FROM YOUR PAST
     DO YOU WISH YOUR WIFE
WOULD NEVER ASK YOU ABOUT AGAIN?
             FRANK.

       - EX-GIRLFRIENDS.
       PAST GIRLFRIENDS.
     'CAUSE, UH, EVERY TIME
       SHE BRINGS IT UP,
       IT'S LIKE BOXING.

       THAT'S WHEN I LOSE
          THAT MATCH.
  - AND YOU ALREADY TAUGHT HER
         HOW TO FIGHT.
          SO YOU'RE--
 EXTREME DISADVANTAGE, YOU ARE.

        GOT YOU. BILLY.
          - HAVE TO BE
        OUR VENICE TRIP.
        SHE ALWAYS ASKS
 ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE--

      SHE MADE ME NOT TELL
     WHAT HAPPENED WITH HER
        WHEN SHE STEPPED
  ON THE GLASS WHEN SHE FELL.
  - SO ABOUT THE VENICE TRIP.
            GOT YOU.

     WHAT ABOUT YOU, DINO?
  - I'D DEFINITELY HAVE TO SAY
        EX-GIRLFRIENDS.
       - EX-GIRLFRIENDS?
         - DEFINITELY.

    MY WIFE IS FROM JAMAICA
AND THOSE JAMAICANS DON'T PLAY.
      WHEN--WHEN--I MEAN,
  SHE'LL HOLD ON TO SOMETHING.
       I'M, LIKE, "BABE,
   THAT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO."

 - OKAY. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS THE FINAL QUESTION.
          HERE YOU GO.
   GUYS, WHICH FOOTBALL TERM
         BEST DESCRIBES

   THE KIND OF ACTION YOU GOT
       ON YOUR FIRST DATE
        WITH YOUR WIFE?
             BILLY.
           - HOLDING.

           - HOLDING?
        - YEAH. HOLDING.
        - GOT YOU. DINO.
   - I DEFINITELY HAVE TO SAY
         INTERCEPTION.

        - INTERCEPTION?
         - YEAH. YEAH.
           - REALLY?
    - I HAD A ROOFTOP PARTY.
   AND THIS IS WHEN SHE AND I
   WERE FRIENDS AT ONE TIME.

AND SOME OF MY BOYS WERE TRYING
       TO KICK IT TO HER.
 AND I WAS, LIKE, "OH, NO, NO."
       I WAS TEXTING HER
  DON'T GIVE HIM YOUR NUMBER.

   IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
      SO I INTERCEPTED IT.
     - SO YOU INTERCEPTED.
     - OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.
    - OKAY, GOT YOU. FRANK.

         - I WOULD SAY
       WE DEFINITELY GOT
  INTO THE MORE PHYSICAL PART
             OF IT.
         THE TACKLING.
            [laughs]

      - IT WAS DEFINITELY
          THE TACKLE.
            - YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT, FELLAS. GREAT JOB.
    NOW WHILE WE'RE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,

    GARY, WOULD YOU TELL US
  ABOUT THE SECOND HONEYMOON?
      - TONIGHT'S WINNERS
        WILL TAKE A TRIP
    TO ALMOND BEACH VILLAGE
          IN BARBADOS.

 ALMOND RESORTS, THE PREMIERE,
     ALL-INCLUSIVE RESORTS

     FIVE DAZZLING RESORTS,

   ONE INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE,
         ALL-INCLUDED.
    VISIT ALMONDRESORTS.COM.
       - ALL RIGHT, GARY,
    I WANT TO GO THERE TOO.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS.
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
   LADIES, WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
      LOOKS AT YOUR CHEST,

      DID HE SAY IT LOOKS
     STRAIGHT BACK AT HIM,
   LOOKS DOWN, OR GLANCES OFF
    IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS?
            LINDSAY.

 - HE WOULD SAY THAT THEY LOOK
     STRAIGHT BACK AT HIM.
            - YEAH?
    - 'CAUSE HE KNOWS BETTER
   THAN TO SAY ANYTHING ELSE.

  - LOOKS STRAIGHT BACK AT ME.
      - WHOO! WHOO! YEAH.
        - OKAY. EILEENA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - THE FIRST ONE.
 - LOOKS STRAIGHT BACK AT HIM?
             - YES.
   - WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
   - 'CAUSE HE KNOWS BETTER.
             - AH.

  THIS IS A "YOU BETTER GET IT
        RIGHT OR ELSE."
            - YEAH.
   - FRANK, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

   LOOK STRAIGHT BACK AT ME.
      ALL RIGHT, CAROLINE,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
     - WELL, IT'S GOT TO BE
    NUMBER ONE STRAIGHT BACK

   BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT GOING
         ANYWHERE ELSE.
   - OKAY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   LOOK STRAIGHT BACK AT ME.
         YEAH, LADIES.

      OKAY. NEXT QUESTION.
  WHAT ONE THING FROM HIS PAST
     DOES YOUR HUSBAND WISH
    YOU WOULD NEVER ASK HIM
          ABOUT AGAIN?

            EILEENA.
  - ABOUT HIS EX-GIRLFRIENDS.
    - ABOUT EX-GIRLFRIENDS?
            - YEAH.
      - DO YOU ALWAYS ASK
     ABOUT EX-GIRLFRIENDS?

 UH-HUH. ALL RIGHT, WHAT WOULD
            YOU SAY?
       MY EX-GIRLFRIENDS.
            - WHOO!
       NOW WHY DO YOU ASK
   ABOUT THE EX-GIRLFRIENDS?

          YOU GOT HIM.
       YOU GOT THE RING.
   HE'S YOURS. YOU HAVE PEED
      ALL OVER HIM, GIRL.
    WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW
 ABOUT THE EX-GIRLFRIENDS FOR?

           - NOTHING.
           - NOTHING?
      - I KNOW HIM BETTER.
    - ALL RIGHT, I GOT YOU.
      NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU,
           CAROLINE?

        - I DON'T KNOW.
  I HAD THIS ONE TIME RECENTLY
      WHEN WE WENT GOLFING
 AND HE KIND OF KNOCKED ME OFF

       OF THE GOLF CART.
      - HE KNOCKED YOU OFF
          A GOLF CART?
         WHAT HAPPENED?

      - DRINKING TOO MUCH.
   AND HE TOOK A SHARP TURN.
      - DO A LITTLE SLALOM
      GOING DOWN THE HILL.

   - AND NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
   YOUR WIFE IS JUST TUMBLING
  LIKE ONE OF THE GOLF BALLS.
            - YEAH.
 - OKAY. YOU TIGER WOODS'D IT.

  ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        TRIP TO VENICE.
       - TRIP TO VENICE.
      - OH, BABE, COME ON.
       - YOURS IS GREAT.
        YOURS IS GREAT.

   I SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF IT.
 - AT LEAST HE KNOWS I'M RIGHT.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
    LINDSAY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - IT'S EITHER EX-GIRLFRIENDS
        OR THE COSTUMES

     HE USED TO DRESS UP AS
          AS A CHILD.
    BUT I THINK HE WOULDN'T
         WANT YOU GUYS
      TO KNOW ABOUT THAT.

   SO I THINK THE SAFE ANSWER
     WOULD HAVE TO BE EXES.
  - OKAY, 'CAUSE WE DON'T WANT
   TO KNOW ABOUT THE COSTUMES
        YOU USED TO WEAR
     WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD.

 SO DID YOU SAY EX-GIRLFRIENDS?
    YOU SAID EX-GIRLFRIENDS.
            - YEAH!
            - MUAH.
        - THAT'S GREAT.

  OH, THAT'S SO AWESOME, DINO.
     BUT I WANT TO GO BACK
        TO THE COSTUMES
       YOU USED TO WEAR.

         WHAT IS THAT?
      - WHEN YOU'RE SMALL,
  YOU DRESS UP LIKE A COWBOY,
          SPIDER-MAN,

     JUST THINGS LIKE THAT.
        - YOU STILL HAVE
       THOSE OUTFITS NOW
       THAT YOU CAN WEAR?

   - I HAVE A COUPLE OF THEM
        THAT I CAN WEAR.
         AT NIGHTTIME.
           - HE DOES.
      - OH, AT NIGHTTIME.
            GOT YOU.

      ALL RIGHT, COUPLES,
  THIS IS YOUR FINAL QUESTION.
  LADIES, WHICH FOOTBALL TERM
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
         BEST DESCRIBES
   THE KIND OF ACTION HE GOT

      ON YOUR FIRST DATE?
           CAROLINE.
        - NOT VERY FAR.
    - DO YOU WATCH FOOTBALL,
             GIRL?

      - NO. CAN YOU TELL?
- 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S
     A "NOT VERY FAR" TERM.
        - UH, LET'S SEE.
       UH, INTERFERENCE.

  - OKAY. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
       YOU SAID HOLDING.
      YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN
TO CAROLINE WHAT HOLDING MEANS.
   - I KNOW WHAT HOLDING IS.
          I KNOW THAT.

         - YOU GOT IT.
         - GRABBING ON.
  - ALL RIGHT, WHAT ABOUT YOU,
            LINDSAY?
    - MAYBE IF I COULD STEAL
            HOLDING.

      IF I COULD SAY THAT.
   - OKAY, HOLDING. GOT YOU.
           ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, DINO?
     YOU SAID INTERCEPTION.
             - OH.

         - YOU KNOW WHY
       HE WOULD SAY THAT?
   - IT WAS AN INTERCEPTION.
    - YEAH, THE ROOF PARTY.
   - EILEENA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I WOULD SAY TOUCHDOWN.

         - A TOUCHDOWN!
         THERE YOU GO.
          I LIKE THAT.
       WHY WOULD YOU SAY
    A TOUCHDOWN? I LOVE IT.

       - WELL, YOU KNOW,
   IT WAS A REALLY LONG DATE.
       - OKAY, TOUCHDOWN.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    HE SAID IT WAS A TACKLE.
        - CLOSE THOUGH.

         IT WAS CLOSE.
  - 'CAUSE DURING THAT REALLY
           LONG DATE,
        HE WAS TACKLING.

            - YEAH.
      - WELL, YOU KNOW...
       - ALL RIGHT, WELL,
       COUPLE NUMBER ONE
     AND COUPLE NUMBER TWO,

       YOU GUYS ARE TIED
        IN FIRST PLACE.
      COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
     YOU HAVE FIVE POINTS.
        BUT DON'T WORRY.
   WE'RE STILL IN THIS GAME.

       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.
         AND THIS TIME,
     WE DOUBLE THE POINTS.

        SO STAY WITH US.
            [laughs]
       [ cellphone rings ]
            HEY HONEY!

  What if we could keep enough
         plastic waste
to fill over 200 garbage trucks

  out of landfills each year?
 6.5 million pounds of plastic,
             gone.

   By using Glad trash bags,
designed with reinforcing bands
         to be stronger
    with less plastic waste,

            we can.
      It's a small change
that can make a big difference.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
        IT IS YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.

        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
          HERE WE GO.
     WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING
          SPARE PARTS

  DOES YOUR HUSBAND NEED MOST
        IN THE BEDROOM:
    AN ACCELERATOR, BRAKES,
           OR A GPS?
            LINDSAY.

    - HE DOESN'T REALLY NEED
    ANY HELP IN THE BEDROOM
     AS FAR AS I WOULD SAY.
        SO MAYBE BRAKES
        TO SLOW IT DOWN

      AND LENGTHEN IT OUT.
      - THAT SOUNDS NICE.
    EILEENA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY BRAKES
    BECAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW
         WHEN TO STOP.
      - DO YOU HAVE TO PUT
  THOSE BRAKES ON FREQUENTLY?

      - OFTEN. VERY OFTEN.
       - OKAY. CAROLINE.
       - I HATE TO COPY,
      BUT IT'S DEFINITELY
     GOT TO BE THE BRAKES.

   HE WANTS IT ALL THE TIME.
     AND WOMAN DOESN'T WORK
THAT WAY ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW?
          YOU COME IN,
     YOU GOT TO, YOU KNOW,

         KISS A LITTLE
      AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
      - I LIKE YOUR BODY.
   YOU'RE JUST LIKE, "YEAH."
    THERE YOU GO. ALL RIGHT.
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE,
            LADIES.
      WHENEVER MY HUSBAND
       WALKS BY ME NAKED,
   I SOMETIMES THINK A BLANK
     ESCAPED FROM THE ZOO.

            EILEENA.
           - A LION.
             - OH!
        YOU THINK A LION
     ESCAPED FROM THE ZOO.

   - YES, 'CAUSE HE'S FIERCE
      AND SEXY, YOU KNOW.
       - OKAY. CAROLINE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
           - A SNAKE.

   IS IT A PYTHON OR A COBRA?
          - IT CAN BE
  WHATEVER YOU WANT IT TO BE.
     - OOH, GIRL! A SNAKE!
            - YEAH.

     - ALL RIGHT, LINDSAY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I'M GOING TO SAY A LION
      BECAUSE HE IS A LEO
  IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.

  AND THAT IS THE PERFECT WORD
        TO DESCRIBE HIM.
    - LEO THE LION. GOT IT.
   ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION,
            LADIES.

       THIS NEXT QUESTION
    IS FROM FAMOUS FOOTWEAR,
      YOUR FAVORITE BRANDS
     FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.
CELEBRITIES LIKE GEORGE CLOONEY
         AND BRAD PITT

    SPORT THE BLACK TIE LOOK
         WHEN THEY STEP
      ONTO THE RED CARPET.
  WHAT IS YOUR HUSBAND'S IDEA
         OF BLACK TIE:

    A TUX WITH ALL THE BELLS
         AND WHISTLES,
     A SUIT WITH A NECKTIE,
          OR A T-SHIRT
      WITH A TUXEDO PRINT?

           CAROLINE.
  - IT'S GOT TO BE NUMBER TWO.
      THE ONE WITH THE...
   - A SUIT WITH THE NECKTIE.
  - THE SUIT WITH THE NECKTIE.

            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.
    'CAUSE HE'S NOT STUFFY.
  SO HE WOULDN'T WEAR THE TUX.

     BUT HE LIKES TO LOOK,
   YOU KNOW, NICE AND SHARP.
  BUT HE CAN PUT A LITTLE BIT
   MORE PIZZAZZ WITH A SUIT.
       - SO IT'S A LITTLE
         CASUAL DRESSY.

            - YEAH.
- YEAH. OKAY. GOT YOU. LINDSAY.
          - I WOULD GO
      WITH NUMBER TWO TOO
          BECAUSE DINO
      IS VERY FASHIONABLE,

         BUT HE'S STILL
       A LITTLE BIT EDGY.
SO HE WOULD WANT TO REBEL IT OUT
     A LITTLE BIT SOMEHOW.

 I have two car insurances in
       front of you here.

        Let's start with
        car insurance X.
  Four million people switched
     to that car insurance
     alone just last year.

              Mmm,
    it's got a nice bouquet.
  Our second car insurance, Y.

             Mmmmm,
   Oh, I can see by your face
they just lost another customer.

     You chose GEICO over
        the competitor.
     Calm down, calm down.
  You're getting carried away.



      "WHENEVER MY HUSBAND
       WALKS BY ME NAKED,
   I SOMETIMES THINK A BLANK
 ESCAPED FROM THE ZOO"? FRANK.
   - I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE
         TO SAY A LION.

           - A LION?
           - A LION.
  - WHY WOULD YOU SAY A LION?
  - 'CAUSE I'M JUST AN ANIMAL
           AT TIMES.

    - WELL, I--I DON'T KNOW.

  THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING WITH.
             - WOW!

          - ALL RIGHT?
        - THAT'S DANGER,
         THAT ANACONDA.
 THEY GO "ANACONDA'S CROSSING.
          STAY AWAY!"

       WHAT MADE YOU PICK
          AN ANACONDA?
   - OH, 'CAUSE I'VE HEARD IT
            BEFORE.
  - LINDSAY, WERE YOU THE ONE
         THAT SAID IT?

     DID YOU SAY ANACONDA?
    - THAT'S MY BAD, SHERRI.
      I SHOULD'VE SAID IT
 'CAUSE I HAVE SAID IT BEFORE.

 BUT I WENT WITH LION FOR LEO.
             - OH!
      - 'CAUSE YOU'RE LEO.
       - BUT YOU SAY IT.

          ARE EXTREME
     POLAR OPPOSITES ABOUT?

            ANTHONY.

      - OKAY, SO YOU DON'T
  REALLY LIKE TO--YOU'RE NOT--

    SHE'LL EVEN EAT MY STUFF
          THAT I LIKE.
             OKAY.
    JASON, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

    - I COULD PROBABLY WATCH
      MORE TV AND MOVIES,
  AND SHE'D RATHER BE READING
  BOOKS OR DOING OTHER THINGS.
           - GOTCHA.

        ALL RIGHT, BEN,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?

 YOU KNOW, THE BROOM HAS TO GO
IN THE PANTRY IN A CERTAIN WAY,

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,

     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS,
         SO HERE WE GO.

        OKAY, LADIES...
     LET'S SAY YOUR HUSBAND
        GETS TO ORDER UP
     WHAT YOU'LL BE WEARING
   WHEN HE GETS HOME TONIGHT.

     DID HE SAY CUTE LITTLE
   COTTON SOCKS AND PANTIES,
    HIGH HEELS AND FISHNETS,
         OR BUCK NAKED
       FROM HEAD TO TOE?

         ALL RIGHT, CJ,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
         - I DON'T HAVE
       TO THINK ABOUT IT:
           BUCK NAKED
       FROM HEAD TO TOE.

   - SO IT'S JUST THE NATURAL
        ORDER OF THINGS?
  ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     [cheers and applause]

       - I KNEW YOU WERE
        GONNA SAY THAT!
           [laughing]
   ARHONDA, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

   - UH, HEELS AND FISHNETS?
   - YOU LIKE THE HIGH HEELS
         AND FISHNETS?
      - YEAH, I LIKE THAT,
    BECAUSE I THINK HE WOULD

    HAVE FUN TAKING IT OFF.
             - OHH.
        - I WOULD THINK.
 - SO HIGH HEELS AND FISHNETS?
             - YES.

     - ALL RIGHT, ANTHONY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - YOU ALWAYS AROUND NAKED.
       - I KNOW! I KNOW!
   - OKAY, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

     WHAT'D HE SAY, NICOLE?
       - UM, I WOULD ALSO
   HAVE TO GO WITH BUCK NAKED
       FROM HEAD TO TOE.

         HE JUST LIKES
     TO GET STRAIGHT TO IT.
           - REALLY?
        - "LET'S JUST--
        LET'S GO, MAN."

   - DID YOU SAY, "LET'S GO"?
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
            - WHAT?
       - YOU'RE SO CUTE.

    - OHH, THAT'S ADORABLE.
           [laughter]
  - ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION.

  EVERYONE LIKES COMPATIBILITY
       IN THEIR MARRIAGE.
    BUT WHAT'S THE ONE THING
       YOUR HUSBAND SAID
   THE TWO OF YOU ARE EXTREME
     POLAR OPPOSITES ABOUT?

            ARHONDA.
         - UM, I WOULD
       HAVE TO SAY FOOD.
       I'M LIKE A FOODIE.
   I LIKE TO EAT EVERYTHING.

     AND HE'S SO CAUTIOUS,
     AND IT MAKES ME SICK.
            - OKAY.
  ANTHONY, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
             FOOD!
          - ALL RIGHT!

     [cheers and applause]
        - OKAY, NICOLE,
        LET'S GO TO YOU.
  - I THINK IT HAS TO BE, UM,

  CLEANLINESS OR ORGANIZATION.
 - ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - I DIDN'T REMEMBER THAT--
             THAT--

            I THINK
     I'M CLEANER THAN THAT.
   - BUT IT'S OKAY, YOU STILL
   CAN COME AROUND FROM THIS.
            - OKAY.
          - ALL RIGHT.

          SO, NICOLE,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
        - WHAT SHE SAID.
      CLEANLINESS AND, UM,

            - UHH...

 - I MEAN, IT WAS A GOOD WEEK.
      DON'T GET ME WRONG.
BUT NOT EVERY TIME HE PUNCHED IN
   HE WAS THERE FOR A WHILE.

             - MM.
       [audience groans]
       - SO YOU'RE SAYING
         HE DID SOME--
       - NO, IT WAS GOOD.

      - QUICKIES ARE FINE.
     THEY ARE TOTALLY FINE.

       - YEAH! LAST WEEK.

           FOREPLAY?
             - NO.
        - WHY? WE DON'T
      HAVE SEX EVERY DAY.
    - WHAT KIND OF EMPLOYEE
          DO YOU HAVE?

        - A REALLY BAD--
      A BAD ONE, I GUESS.
           A BAD ONE.
       - I THINK SOMEBODY
  FIBBIN' ON THEIR TIME CARD.

           [laughter]
         ALL RIGHT, CJ,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
             - 17?

          - 17 HOURS?
  - I MEAN, DOES THAT INCLUDE,
             LIKE,

  THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD.
     SHE GAVE YOU 17 HOURS.

   YOU THOUGHT YOU WAS DOING.
     - GUESS, LIKE, SITTING
         ON THE COUCH,
     THAT COUNTS SOMETIMES,
           YOU KNOW.

  STROKIN' THE HAIR, YOU KNOW.
       - YOU GOT STROKIN'
    COUNTING FOR SOMETHING.
       YOU NEED TO COUNT
         THE STROKIN'.

   YOU FORGOT TO COUNT THAT.
           ALL RIGHT.

       - OKAY, LAST WEEK
     WAS AN EXCELLENT WEEK.
             - OH!

 ALL RIGHT, LADIES, IT IS YOUR
 TURN TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
   THESE NEXT THREE ARE WORTH
        TEN POINTS EACH.
   OKAY, OUR FIRST QUESTION.

WHICH OF THESE WOULD BE EASIEST
   FOR YOUR HUSBAND TO SPOT:
         FAKE LAUGHTER,
          FAKE BOOBS,
       OR A FAKE ORGASM?

              CJ.
           - OH, MAN.
  - HAS HE SEEN 'EM ALL, GIRL?
           [laughter]

        - HE HASN'T SEEN
         THE LAST ONE.
             - MM.
      - OKAY, FAKE BOOBS.

       THAT IS MY ANSWER
      BECAUSE THEY FLOAT.
           [laughter]
            - OKAY.
  ARHONDA, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

  - IT WOULD BE FAKE LAUGHTER
           BECAUSE...
     I DON'T THINK HE KNOWS
      ABOUT THE LAST TWO.
        HE HAS NO CLUE.

           - GOTCHA.
 OKAY, NICOLE, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
  - UM, IT'S DEFINITELY GOTTA
       BE THE FAKE BOOBS.
        BECAUSE I LAUGH
      AT ALL OF HIS JOKES,

          WHETHER THEY
       ARE FUNNY OR NOT,
         AND HE THINKS
        HE IS <i>HILARIOUS.</i>
           [laughter]

- OKAY, SO IT'S THE FAKE BOOBS.
       - THE FAKE BOOBS.
           - GOTCHA.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
    "IT'S FUNNY; I'VE NEVER
BEEN TRAINED AS A PROCTOLOGIST,
 "BUT I CAN OFFICIALLY DIAGNOSE
   MY HUSBAND'S FRIEND BLANK

  AS A MAJOR PAIN IN THE ASS."
   ARHONDA, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
  - UM, SOMETIMES HIS SISTER.

       - WHAT'S HER NAME?
          - OH. NIKKY.
            - NIKKY?
      - YEAH, SHE'S COOL.
       SHE'S GOOD PEOPLE.

   BUT THEY'RE SO DIFFERENT.
          - I GOTCHA.
           ALL RIGHT.
            NICOLE.

      - UM, I'M GONNA HAVE
   TO GO WITH HIS FRIEND ANNA
    BECAUSE SHE'S VERY LOUD
     AND SHE HAS NO FILTER
          WHATSOEVER.

    - GOTCHA. ALL RIGHT, CJ,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
    - HIS NICKNAME IS CUBBY.
 UM, BUT HIS REAL NAME IS RYAN.

      ONE TIME, HE STAYED
          AT OUR PLACE
     KIND OF INDEFINITELY.
   - DID HE FINALLY GET OUT?

       - HE FINALLY DID.
     I DON'T REMEMBER WHEN.
 HE JUST WASN'T THERE ANYMORE.
 - HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN BURIED
        IN THE BACKYARD?

           [laughter]
   - OH, YEAH. I DON'T KNOW.
      - OOH. OKAY, LADIES.
         NEXT QUESTION.
     ALL RIGHT, SO, LADIES,
           BE HONEST.

      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
 YOU FIND IRRESISTIBLE IN A MAN
      THAT, UNFORTUNATELY,
      YOUR HUSBAND DOESN'T
      HAVE GOING FOR HIM?

       [audience "oohs"]
           NICOLE...
   - UM, A FULL HEAD OF HAIR.

     MY HUSBAND'S BALDING.
       IT WOULD BE BETTER
    IF HE HAD SOME, I GUESS.
        - OKAY, GOTCHA.

           THE HAIR.
            - HAIR.
     - ALL RIGHT, AND WHAT
        DO YOU SAY, CJ?
       - HEH, A BIGGER--
          A BIG NOSE.

  I LIKE GUYS WITH BIG NOSES.
           - REALLY?
         - BUT HE'S HAD
    [whispering] A NOSE JOB.
           [all gasp]

   UM, WHICH LOOKS GREAT TOO.
  WHICH LOOKS SUPER GREAT TOO.
      BUT I ALWAYS--I LOOK
      AT HIS OLD PICTURES,

I'M LIKE, "OH, YOU LOOK SO CUTE
      WITH YOUR OLD NOSE.
  BUT YOU LOOK CUTE NOW TOO."
    - THAT'S A LITTLE SEXY.
          A BIG NOSE.

         - I THINK SO.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    ARHONDA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I LOVE MY HUSBAND.

            UM, BUT,
     I USED TO DATE, LIKE,
   REALLY BIG, STRAPPING MEN.
           - MM-HMM.

    - AND MY HUSBAND IS NOT
       BIG AND STRAPPING.
            - OKAY.
    HE PUTS IT DOWN, THOUGH.
        - THERE YOU GO.
    THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

       - I'M TELLING YOU.
     ALL RIGHT, NOW HERE'S
      OUR BONUS QUESTION.
      THIS BONUS QUESTION
         HAS TWO PARTS.

           EACH PART

        FIRST QUESTION.

WHICH OF THESE WOULD BE EASIEST
        FOR YOU TO SPOT:
         FAKE LAUGHTER,
          FAKE BOOBS,

       OR A FAKE ORGASM?
              BEN.
      - I THINK, UH, THE--

         I COULD SPOT,
       UH, FAKE LAUGHTER
       BEFORE I CAN SPOT
          FAKE BOOBS.
          - ALL RIGHT,
     WHAT DID YOU SAY, CJ?

           - OHH. OW.
           - ANTHONY,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
         - FAKE ORGASM.

      - SO YOU COULD SPOT
         A FAKE ORGASM.
             - YES.
  - WHAT DO YOU SAY, ARHONDA?
         FAKE LAUGHTER.

       - ARE YOU SERIOUS?
            - YEAH.
    'CAUSE THE ORGASM THING,
        YOU ALREADY SAID
        YOU DON'T KNOW.

             - NO!
     - NOT THAT I HAVE TO.
        I DON'T HAVE TO.
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT!
    - BECAUSE ARHONDA NEVER
 HAS TO FAKE AN ORGASM. NO, NO.

       - NO, NO, I HANDLE
       MY BUSINESS WELL.
           [laughter]
        - THERE YOU GO.
           - MM-MMM.

      - ALL RIGHT, JASON,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
        - WELL, I ALWAYS
       THOUGHT OF MYSELF
     IN MY PRE-MARRIED LIFE

     AS A BOOB CONNOISSEUR.
          - OH, RIGHT.
         - SO, UM, I--
        I WOULD THINK...

        - GOOD TO KNOW.
         GOOD TO KNOW.
      - I WOULD THINK THAT
        I WOULD BE ABLE
      TO SPOT FAKE BOOBS,

     'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY
   LIKE THE FAKE ONES, SO...
            - OKAY.
      SO WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - YAY, WE'RE ON THE BOARD!
            - YEAH!

            - YEAH.
     - WE'RE ON THE BOARD!
        - THERE YOU GO.
        - NO GOOSE EGG!

          - ALL RIGHT,
     ARE YOU HAPPY TO KNOW
       THAT YOUR HUSBAND
     IS A BOOB CONNOISSEUR?
       - HEY...WHATEVER.
       IT DOESN'T MATTER.

           [laughter]
  - NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

    "IT'S FUNNY; I'VE NEVER
BEEN TRAINED AS A PROCTOLOGIST,
 "BUT I CAN OFFICIALLY DIAGNOSE
   MY HUSBAND'S FRIEND BLANK
           AS A MAJOR
       PAIN IN THE ASS."

            ANTHONY.
            - STEVE.
          - ALL RIGHT.

        WELL, LET'S SEE
       WHAT ARHONDA SAID.
             NIKKY.
     - SHE'S NOT MY FRIEND.
       THAT'S MY SISTER!

    - I KNOW, I KNOW, BUT...
     - I MEAN, SHE'S COOL,
         BUT, YOU KNOW.
 - THEY JUST DIFFERENT PEOPLE,
           YOU KNOW?

  - JASON, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
         - I MIGHT HAVE
       TO GO WITH KEVIN,
     AND WE CALL HIM "BIZ"
           SOMETIMES.

      HE'S, UH, YOU KNOW,
  A NICE GUY, BUT MAYBE TALKS
  A LITTLE TOO MUCH SOMETIMES.
    - OKAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

         - I SAID ANNA.
          - OHH, YEAH.
           [laughter]

   - BEN, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
      - UH, MY FIRST GUESS
     IS MY BROTHER MICHAEL.
    - OKAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

             RYAN!
             - OHH.
      - BECAUSE--MICHAEL?
    I THOUGHT ABOUT MICHAEL,
     BUT HE'S YOUR BROTHER!

    - SO YOU LOST A BROTHER
         AND A FRIEND.
            - YEAH.
           - I KNOW!
      - I PROBABLY DIDN'T
        LOSE A BROTHER.

         - OH, MY GOSH.
     ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
         YOUR WIFE SAID

           SHE FINDS
     IRRESISTIBLE IN A MAN
      THAT, UNFORTUNATELY,
 YOU DON'T HAVE GOING FOR YOU?
       ALL RIGHT, JASON.

     - UH, A BIG PAYCHECK?
             UH...
           [laughter]
       - SO WHAT'D YOU--
           ALL RIGHT.

   - WHAT WRONG ANSWER IS IT?
           OHH, MAN.
        WELL, YOU KNOW.

   - BABY, I DON'T CARE ABOUT
    HOW MUCH MONEY YOU MAKE.
           - I KNOW.
           all: AWW.

          - OKAY, BEN,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
         - I THINK, UH,
  I THINK SHE'D LIKE A LITTLE
    BIT MORE OF A SIX-PACK.

   LESS OF A PUDGE, YOU KNOW.
     - REALLY? HAS SHE EVER
  COMPLAINED ABOUT YOUR PUDGE?
  - EH, WELL, SHE CAN BE LIKE,
           "HEH HEH."

         - OH, LIKE YOU
     THE LITTLE DOUGH BOY.
             YEAH.
      CJ, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

        - YOUR BIG NOSE!
      SHE LIKES BIG NOSES.
   - WHATEVER, WE TALK ABOUT
     THE NOSE ALL THE TIME.

           [laughter]
            - OKAY.
  ANTHONY, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
        - THE ONLY THING
       THAT I DON'T HAVE

            IS HAIR.
   - OKAY, WHAT DID YOU SAY,
            ARHONDA?
         - BABY, YOU--
       - WHAT? BIG WHAT?

      - BIG AND STRAPPING.
         - NO, NO, NO!
           NO, BABY.

   - NOT PACKING, STRAPPING.
       BIG, LIKE, BULKY.
       - NO, NO, ANTHONY,
        WE ALREADY KNOW,

     'CAUSE YOU'VE TOLD US
       YOU'RE STRAPPING.
         WE KNOW THAT.
            - OKAY.
- YOU'RE STRAPPIN' AND PACKIN'.
          WE GOT THAT.

       - OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
            - WHOO!
    GLAD THAT WAS DEFLECTED.

  ALL RIGHT, COUPLE NUMBER ONE
           AND THREE,
  YOU'RE TIED WITH 10 POINTS.
       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
    YOU'RE TRAILING BEHIND,

     BUT YOU CAN MAKE THIS
          TURN AROUND!
    STICK AROUND--OUR FINAL
  BONUS QUESTION IS COMING UP,
   AND IT'S WORTH 30 POINTS.

       SO ANYONE CAN WIN.
         DON'T GO AWAY!

  I REMEMBER THE DAY MY DOCTOR
  TOLD ME I HAVE AN IRREGULAR
        <i>IT'</i>HEARTBEAT,<i>VERY.</i>

 AND THAT IT PUT ME AT 5-TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE.
         I WAS WORRIED.
    I WORRIED ABOUT MY WIFE,
         AND MY FAMILY.

BILL HAS THE MOST
COMMON TYPE OF ATRIAL
FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
IT'S NOT CAUSED BY
A HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
         HE WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
             BUT I'VE PUT HIM ON
               PRADAXA INSTEAD.

IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA 150
  MGS REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
   MORE THAN WARFARIN WITHOUT
   THE NEED FOR REGULAR BLOOD
             TESTS.
 I SURE WAS GLAD TO HEAR THAT.

  PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING. DON'T
    TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU HAVE
  ABNORMAL BLEEDING, AND SEEK
           IMMEDIATE
  MEDICAL CARE FOR UNEXPECTED
       SIGNS OF BLEEDING,
     LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
PRADAXA MAY INCREASE YOUR
 BLEEDING RISK IF YOU'RE 75 OR
             OLDER,

   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
     LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,
  OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS, OR
 BLOODTHINNERS, OR IF YOU HAVE
        KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
 ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE CERTAIN
           MEDICINES.

   TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT ALL
MEDICINES YOU TAKE, ANY PLANNED
 MEDICAL OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
 AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,
    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
       YOUR STROKE RISK.

   OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
       UPSET, OR BURNING.
                      PRADAXA IS
                       PROGRESS.
                IF YOU HAVE AFIB
                 NOT CAUSED BY A
            HEART VALVE PROBLEM,

   ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
REDUCE YOUR RISK OF STROKE WITH
            PRADAXA.

       BACK IN MARRIAGE,
        SHERRI SHEPHERD.
        - HI, EVERYBODY.
              HEY!

             HELLO!
       HELLO, NEWLYWEDS!
             OKAY.

             WHOO!
       ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL.
         THANKS, GARY.

           WELCOME TO
        <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>
THE SHOW THAT TAKES PILLOW TALK
      AND MAKES IT PUBLIC.
  ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE THREE NEW
    COUPLES WITH US TONIGHT.

   SO LET'S MEET THEM, GARY.
        - SHERRI, HERE'S
       COUPLE NUMBER ONE,
       COLIN AND BROOKE.

    SHE WORE WHITE SNEAKERS
        TO THE WEDDING,
     AND THEIR FIRST DANCE
             WAS TO
        <i>YO! GABBA GABBA'S</i>
      <i>"PARTY IN MY TUMMY."</i>

       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
      BRENNAN AND MELANIE,
   WENT FROM FACEBOOK FRIENDS
   TO WEDDING VOWS IN VEGAS.

 HIS FIRST LINE WHEN THEY MET?
     "GEE, YOU'RE PRETTY...
        FOR A CANADIAN."

    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
       JOHN AND JENNIFER.
       HE PROPOSED TO HER
          WITH A LINE

    FROM ONE OF HIS FAVORITE
        ROMANTIC FILMS.
              <i>ROCKY.</i>
       [imitating Rocky]
   YO, SHERRI, BACK TO YOUZ!

     [cheers and applause]
            - OKAY.
       I LOVE THIS, JOHN.
   I WATCH <i>ROCKY</i> ALL THE TIME.

   I NEVER THOUGHT YOU COULD
    GET A PROPOSAL FROM IT.
     TELL ME WHAT YOU SAID.
        - WELL, HE'S GOT
       A WAY WITH WORDS.

        SO HE SAID, UM--
            I SAID--
         I KNEELED DOWN
          AND I SAID,
"I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULDN'T
  MIND MARRYING ME TOO MUCH."

             - OH!
          - "SO MUCH."
      - IT WAS "TOO MUCH."
- DO YOU CORRECT HIM LIKE THAT?
           "SO MUCH."

       - I CORRECTED HIM.
  - SHE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
       MOVIE IT WAS FROM.
          - I LOVE IT.
   NOW, BRANDON AND MELANIE.

   OKAY, SO WHO DID YOU DATE?
I MEAN DID THEY LOOK LIKE BEARS?
     'CAUSE SHE LOOKS GOOD.
       - SHE'S GORGEOUS.
    - YEAH, FOR A CANADIAN.

    YOU ARE BEAUTIFUL, GIRL.
     - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
         WHAT IS THAT?
     - I DON'T KNOW, GIRL.
         JUST LET IT GO
        AND YOU MARRIED.

        JUST LET IT GO.
        ALL RIGHT, MAMA.
            SO OKAY,
     I PLAY <i>YO! GABBA GABBA</i>

   FOR MY FIVE-YEAR-OLD SON.
      BUT IT TAKES ANOTHER
        MEANING WHEN YOU
  PLAY IT AS YOUR FIRST DANCE
      AT THE WEDDING, HUH?

   - I MEAN, WE'RE BIG KIDS.
       - AND THAT WAS THE
  PERFECT WEDDING SONG FOR US.
          - ALL RIGHT.

            - OKAY.
           - MM-HMM.
   - WELL, WELCOME, COUPLES.
    GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU.
   LADIES, WHY DON'T YOU HEAD
    BACKSTAGE SO WE CAN ASK

         YOUR HUSBANDS
        SOME QUESTIONS.
      AND WE'RE GONNA SEE
    IF YOU CAN ANSWER THEM.
       GO ON BACK THERE.

     OKAY, GUYS, I'M GONNA
   ASK Y'ALL THREE QUESTIONS,
  AND IT'S GONNA BE UP TO YOUR
  WIVES TO MATCH YOUR ANSWERS.
THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST POINTS
     AT THE END OF THE GAME

         IS GONNA WIN A
  FANTASTIC SECOND HONEYMOON.
       SO ARE YOU READY?
            - YEAH.
           - WE ARE.

  - OKAY HERE WE GO, HUSBANDS.
           ALL RIGHT.
        OKAY, GET READY.

      GIVE US YOUR WIFE'S
         STRIPPER NAME,
 USING HER MOOD IN THE MORNING
       AS HER FIRST NAME
 AND HER FAVORITE SEX POSITION
       AS HER LAST NAME.

       ALL RIGHT, COLIN.
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
    - MOOD IN THE MORNING--
   - HER MOOD IN THE MORNING.
          - IS SUPER.

   HER FAVORITE SEX POSITION?
     - LIKES TO BE ON TOP.
        SO SHE'S RIDING.
         SHE'S A RIDER.
          SUPER RIDER.
          - I GOT IT.

             OKAY.
  BRENNAN, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
         - GOOD DOGGIE.

     AND I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY GOOD DOGGIE?
    - SHE'S ABSOLUTELY IN A
 FANTASTIC MOOD EVERY MORNING.

       I DON'T UNDERSTAND
        HOW IT HAPPENS.
          I CAN'T EVEN
        COMPREHEND HOW.
       - YOU HAVE NOTHING
      TO DO WITH IT, HUH?

     - AND I DON'T REALLY--
      DO I HAVE TO EXPLAIN
        THE SECOND PART?
        - NO, YOU DON'T.
         - FAIR ENOUGH.

           I GOT IT.
          THEN, JOHN,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
       CRABBY MISSIONARY.

          SHE'S NOT IN
       A VERY GOOD MOOD.
 I PROBABLY HAVE A LITTLE TO DO
   WITH THAT IN THE MORNING.
      - CRABBY MISSIONARY?
       - [laughing] YEAH.

 - ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA GO ON
     TO OUR NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
  THE ONE THING I HAVE ALWAYS
         WANTED TO TRY,

BUT MY WIFE WOULD NEVER GO FOR,
   WOULD DEFINITELY BE BLANK.
   BRENNAN, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
    I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY--
      CAN I SAY TWO WOMEN?

          - [laughing]
       IF THAT'S WHAT YOU
     ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY.
        - I--ABSOLUTELY,
     I THINK ANY GUY WOULD.

            - THAT--
    - I'M LOOKING FOR HELP,
         I DON'T KNOW.
           - ANY MAN
        WITH HIS WIFE...

         - PLEASE HELP?
            PLEASE?
- BRENNAN, ANY MAN WITH HIS WIFE
     IS NOT GONNA HELP YOU.
         - SINGLE GUYS?

             - NO.
    YOU'RE NOT GETTING ANY.
    OKAY, SO TWO--ALL RIGHT.
       TWO WOMEN. GOTCHA.
   JOHN, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

 - I'M GONNA SIDE WITH MY BUDDY
   HERE AND SAY A THREESOME.
         - A THREESOME?
             OKAY.
          ENOUGH SAID.
  - YOU CAN ONLY PRAY, RIGHT?

          - YOU PRAY.
   COLIN, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
         - REAR ENTRY.

             - OH!
             - WOW.

     Y'ALL ASKING FOR A LOT
   WHEN YOU JUST GET MARRIED.
             WHOO!
       - I'LL TAKE THAT.
    - OKAY, FINAL QUESTION.

    IF THE MACY'S DAY PARADE
            WERE TO
         MAKE A BALLOON
      BASED ON YOUR BODY,
    WHICH PART WOULD REQUIRE
        THE MOST HELIUM?

        ALL RIGHT, JOHN.
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
           - OH, WOW.
          UH, MY HEAD.
     I'LL GO WITH MY HEAD.
          - YOUR HEAD?

           - MY HEAD.
       - I GOT WHICH HEAD
     YOU WAS TALKING ABOUT.
        ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

   COLIN, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
             -ARMS.
          - YOUR ARMS.
            - YEAH.
   - REQUIRE THE MOST HELIUM.
             OKAY.

    BRENNAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - MY HEAD, ABSOLUTELY.
          - YOUR HEAD?
       - SHE IS NEVER SHY
        ABOUT TELLING ME

            ABOUT MY
     EGO/ATTITUDE PROBLEM.
        - OKAY, GOT IT.
       ALL RIGHT, FELLAS.
     THAT WAS A GREAT JOB.

  SO WHILE THE LADIES RETURN,
        LET'S HEAR ABOUT
  TONIGHT'S ONCE-IN-A-LIFETIME
   SECOND HONEYMOON VACATION.
      - TONIGHT'S WINNERS
          ARE GOING TO

         LONG BAY BEACH
       RESORT AND VILLAS,
     AN ELITE ISLAND RESORT
           ON TORTOLA
 IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

      A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE
       SET THEIR OWN PACE
  AND EVERYTHING IS UNSPOILED,
     EXCEPT FOR THE GUESTS.
     LONG BAY BEACH RESORT.

         - NOW THAT'S A
SECOND HONEYMOON I COULD GO FOR.
             OKAY.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
  WHILE YOU WERE GONE, I ASKED
 YOUR HUSBAND THREE QUESTIONS,

     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.
         SO HERE WE GO.
        FIRST QUESTION.

WE ASKED YOUR HUSBAND TO COME UP
    WITH YOUR STRIPPER NAME
   BY USING YOUR MOOD IN THE
  MORNING FOR YOUR FIRST NAME
 AND YOUR FAVORITE SEX POSITION
       AS YOUR LAST NAME.

       WHAT DO YOU THINK
         HE CALLED YOU?
            BROOKE?
         - HAPPY RIDER?

       - NOW WHAT--OKAY,
        WHY DO YOU THINK
   HE CALLED YOU HAPPY RIDER?
       - WELL, I'M HOPING
   I'M HAPPY IN THE MORNING.

 I MEAN, I'M HAPPY TO BE ALIVE.
     - AND THE SECOND ONE?
        - WELL, I THINK
     IT'S SELF-EXPLANATORY.
        - THERE YOU GO.

         IT REALLY IS.
        I GOT IT, GIRL.
WELL, LET'S SEE WHAT COLIN SAID.
     WHAT DID YOU CALL HER?
         - SUPER RIDER!

        - JUDGES, CAN WE
      GO WITH SUPER RIDER?
              NO.
           I'M SORRY.
 WE CAN'T GO WITH SUPER RIDER.

            OH, WOW.
    - IT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY.
        - YOU KNOW WHAT?
       BUT YOU GUYS WERE
   RIGHT IN THE RIDING PLACE.

             - HEY.
          - IT'S OKAY.
        GIVE HIM A KISS,
 'CAUSE I THINK THAT WAS GREAT.
              YES.
         - I LOVE YOU.

      - THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
         - SO I'M SUPER
        IN THE MORNING?
          - GOOD TRY.

   OKAY, MELANIE, WHAT DO YOU
    THINK YOUR HUSBAND SAID?
       - PROBABLY SMILEY.
            - OKAY.

        - AND IF I STAY
       IN THE MORNING...
   I WOULD SAY HAPPY MISSION.
      - SO HAPPY MISSION.

        OKAY, LET'S SEE
       WHAT BRENNAN SAID.
    - I SAID SMILEY MISSION.
           I'M SORRY.
           - SMILEY.
        SMILEY MISSION.

   WHAT DID YOU SAY, BRENNAN?
          GOOD DOGGIE.
          - [laughing]

      - OKAY, HERE WE GO.
           ALL RIGHT.
  JENNIFER, WHAT DO YOU THINK
       YOUR HUSBAND SAID?

      - I'M GONNA GO WITH
       MOODY MISSIONARY.
      - MOODY MISSIONARY?
       - OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
    JOHN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

       CRABBY MISSIONARY.
            JUDGES?
     - I SAY THAT'S CLOSE.
   - THAT WON'T WORK, JUDGES?
      OH, WE CAN'T DO IT.

              OH.
      OKAY, NEXT QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

         THE ONE THING
  I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO TRY,
BUT MY WIFE WOULD NEVER GO FOR,
   WOULD DEFINITELY BE BLANK.
      ALL RIGHT, MELANIE.

       WHAT DO YOU THINK
       YOUR HUSBAND SAID?
- I KNOW WHAT HE WOULD THINK OF,
       BUT I KNOW THAT--
 - WHAT WAS HE THINKING, GIRL?

    - HAVING ANOTHER PERSON.
            - OKAY.
       WELL, DID YOU SAY
     HAVING ANOTHER PERSON?
           TWO WOMEN!

         THAT IS GREAT.
      I LOVE HOW YOU SAID,
 "I KNOW WHAT HE WAS THINKING,
     BUT HE DIDN'T SAY IT."

             OKAY.
  JENNIFER, WHAT DO YOU THINK
       YOUR HUSBAND SAID?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
        THE SAME THING.

       - YOU HAVE TO SAY
        THE SAME THING?
            - YEAH.
    - MORE THAN ONE PERSON?
   - JOHN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

          A THREESOME!
       BROOKE, I SEE YOU.
            OH, GOD.
       WHAT DO YOU THINK
       YOUR HUSBAND SAID?

         - UM, I'D HAVE
      TO GO WITH NOTHING.
      I'M PRETTY FLEXIBLE.
       - YOU ARE SITTING
      NEXT TO A GROWN MAN.

      DO YOU REALLY THINK
   YOUR HUSBAND SAID NOTHING?
          - [whimpers]
        I'M PRETTY OPEN.
   - BABY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

          REAR ENTRY.
- I WAS THINKING THAT TOO, BUT--
       - IT'S ALL RIGHT.
     - IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

            - OKAY!
     ALL RIGHT, AND HERE'S
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
    IF THE MACY'S DAY PARADE
     WERE TO MAKE A BALLOON

            BASED ON
      YOUR HUSBAND'S BODY,
    WHICH PART WOULD REQUIRE
        THE MOST HELIUM?
   JENNIFER, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

          - I WOULD GO
         WITH HIS BUTT.
    - OKAY WELL LET'S SEE--
    JOHN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I MEAN, MY HEAD.
          - HIS HEAD.

           - MY BUTT?
        - I DON'T KNOW.
     - I HAVE A TINY BUTT.
      - ALL RIGHT, BROOKE.

       WHAT DO YOU THINK
       YOUR HUSBAND SAID?
     - UM, WHAT DID HE SAY?
        WHAT DID HE SAY?
     NO, WHAT I WOULD SAY.
     UM, HIS PRIVATE AREA?

          - OKEYDOKEY.
    COLIN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           HIS ARMS.
             - OH.

    - NO, THOSE ARE BIG TOO.
           - BROOKE.
    YOU NEVER SAY YOUR MAN'S
   PRIVATE AREA NEEDS HELIUM.

        JUST GO HOME AND
   MAKE HIM FEEL GOOD, GIRL.
           ALL RIGHT.
   WE'RE GONNA GO TO MELANIE.
       WHAT DO YOU THINK
       YOUR HUSBAND SAID?

      - I WOULD DEFINITELY
         SAY HIS HEAD.
          - HIS HEAD?
             - YES.
            - OKAY.
   BRENNAN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

      - OH, THAT'S RIGHT.
             - OH!
         - YOU'RE GOOD.
            - WHOO!
          - ALL RIGHT,

      - SOMETHING TELLS ME
           YOU'RE NOT

    AS SWEET AS YOU'RE JUST
       PRETENDING TO BE.

      - BEING A GENTLEMAN.
         FROM HIS DAD.
            - OKAY.

      - AND, UM...MAYBE...
     JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS
         FROM HIS MOM.
       - I'M NOT SURE IF
        YOU'RE GOING TO

      HAVE A MOTHER-IN-LAW
       AFTER THIS, BUT--
             - NO!
          NO, NO, NO.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   MELANIE, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

    - UM, HIS SENSE OF, UH,
        BEING ORGANIZED.
         FROM HIS DAD.
            - OKAY.
      - AND THE CRAZINESS
         FROM HIS MOM.

      ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER.
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
         - I WOULD SAY
    HIS TEMPER FROM HIS DAD.

           - MM-HMM.
        - AND HIS HEIGHT
         FROM HIS MOM.
            - OKAY.
