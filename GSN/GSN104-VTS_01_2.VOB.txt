   - WELCOME BACK TO <i>BAGGAGE.</i>
  NOW NICHOLAS HAS JUST CHOSEN
  JENNA HERE FOR A NICE DATE,
  BUT THE TABLES HAVE TURNED,
      AND NOW, OF COURSE,

      IT IS HER DECISION.
       WHAT'S THE SECRET
   IN NICHOLAS' BIG RED BAG?
  DOES HE SPEND $1,000 A MONTH
          ON ALCOHOL?

          DID HE WORK
   AS A GRIM REAPER STRIPPER?
 OR DID HE SEND NAKED PICTURES
    OF HIS EX TO HER FATHER?
        JENNA, OF THESE
      THREE POSSIBILITIES,

WHICH WOULD BE THE TOUGHEST ONE
   FOR YOU TO HAVE TO ACCEPT?
    - SENDING NAKED PICTURES
    OF HIS EX TO HER FATHER.
            - YEAH.

         - THAT'S JUST,
      LIKE, DISRESPECTFUL.
        LIKE, HER FATHER
   DOESN'T WANT TO SEE THAT.
            - YEAH.
          - YOU KNOW?

    LIKE, YOU'RE HURTING HIM
         MORE THAN HER.
         - GOOD POINT.
         SO, NICHOLAS,
  PLEASE REVEAL YOUR BAGGAGE.

     WHAT EXACTLY IS THAT?
       - YOU KNOW, JERRY,
       I WAS IN COLLEGE,
AND, YOU KNOW, I NEEDED TO MAKE
     A LITTLE EXTRA MONEY.

 I WANTED TO BUY A BASS GUITAR.
  I WAS LIVING IN AN APARTMENT
     WITH MY BAND MEMBERS,
  AND, YOU KNOW, I FOUND AN AD
  LOOKING FOR MALE STRIPPERS.

   AND I HAD TO DRESS UP AS A
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CHARACTERS,
    AND, UH, THE GRIM REAPER
        WAS ONE OF THEM.
I FIGURED, "HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
   IT'S NOT THAT BAD OF GIG."

   - I-IT IS A LITTLE MORBID.
        - IT DOES SOUND
        A LITTLE MORBID,
 BUT IT WAS ACTUALLY THE GIRLS
    WHO CHOSE THE CHARACTER

     THEY WANTED TO SHOW UP
        AT THEIR HOUSE.
     SO, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,
  SOMEBODY HAS A MORBID SENSE
      OF FANTASY, I GUESS.

      - WHAT DO YOU THINK?
   - DO YOU SEE DEAD PEOPLE?
           - [laughs]
   - IF YOU SAW ME STRIPPING,
    YOU'D SEE A DEAD PERSON.

   NOW WHAT ARE YOUR CONCERNS
      WHEN YOU HEAR THIS?
 - WELL, NICHOLAS, A STRIPPER?
         I DON'T KNOW.
        I DO HAVE A SON,

      SO THE GUY I'M WITH
        DOES HAVE TO BE
   A POSITIVE MALE ROLE MODEL
            FOR HIM,
AND I DEFINITELY DON'T WANT YOU
 GETTING NAKED FOR OTHER GIRLS.

  - AND WHAT IF THAT STRIPPER
   HAD A TATTOO ON HER BUTT?
     - THAT SAYS "DANGER."
  - SO, JENNA, IS THIS BAGGAGE
   SOMETHING YOU CAN ACCEPT?

  - I CAN ACCEPT YOUR BAGGAGE.
        - THERE YOU GO!
        CONGRATULATIONS.
 JENNA AND NICHOLAS WILL ENJOY
   A ROMANTIC DINNER FOR TWO

  AT RUTH'S CHRIS STEAK HOUSE
       IN BEVERLY HILLS,
  AND WE'LL SEE YOU NEXT TIME
          ON <i>BAGGAGE,</i>
    WHERE EVERY RELATIONSHIP
   IS AN OPEN-AND-SHUT CASE.

          GOOD NIGHT.
  Captioning provided by GSN.
  - SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA WEAR
      FOR OUR FIRST DATE?

     - I HAVE A FEW OUTFITS
            IN MIND.
     - AS LONG AS IT'S NOT
        THE GRIM REAPER.
     - ALL RIGHT, I PROMISE
       I WON'T WEAR THAT.

            - OKAY.

      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
 <i>Ke</i>PUT ME AT 5 TIMES<i>ats cereal.</i>
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,
  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.

 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,

BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)

    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,
      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.

 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.
   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING

AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK

     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,
    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,

OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.
    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,

     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
