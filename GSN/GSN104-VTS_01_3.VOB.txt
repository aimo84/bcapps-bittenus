$20,000.
LET'S GET IT ON RIGHT AFTER
THIS. THE DECICCO FAMILY!

        HERSHEY'S BLISS.
 ONE SQUARE INCH OF INCREDIBLY
     SMOOTH RICH CHOCOLATE.

   ONE SQUARE INCH OF BLISS.

WOW! WHO DELIVERED THESE
PIZZA DIPPING STRIPS?
       OH, THEY'RE NOT DELIVERY.

           THEY'RE NEW DIGIORNO
           PIZZA DIPPING STRIPS.
        WITH TWO SAUCES?
       WHO NEEDS DELIVERY?
         [ horn honks ]

                  THAT GUY.
        <i>[ Male Announcer ]</i>
       <i>TWELVE PIZZA STRIPS,</i>
       <i>PERFECT FOR DIPPING.</i>
        <i>IT'S NOT DELIVERY.</i>

        <i>IT'S NEW DIGIORNO</i>
      <i>PIZZA DIPPING STRIPS.</i>
  IF YOU HAVE COPD LIKE I DO,
      YOU KNOW HOW HARD
      IT CAN BE TO BREATHE
        <i>IT'S NOT DELIVERY.</i>

   AND WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.
   COPD INCLUDES CHRONIC
   BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA.
     SPIRIVA HELPS CONTROL
     MY COPD SYMPTOMS

     BY KEEPING MY AIRWAYS
     OPEN A FULL 24 HOURS.
        PLUS, IT REDUCES
        COPD FLARE-UPS.
      SPIRIVA IS THE ONLY
      ONCE-DAILY INHALED

   COPD MAINTENANCE TREATMENT
   THAT DOES BOTH.
     AND IT'S STEROID-FREE.
    SPIRIVA DOES NOT REPLACE
    FAST-ACTING INHALERS

      FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.
   TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF
   YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
  GLAUCOMA, TROUBLE URINATING,
  OR AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.

 THESE MAY WORSEN WITH SPIRIVA.
   DISCUSS ALL MEDICINES
   YOU TAKE, EVEN EYE DROPS.
  STOP TAKING SPIRIVA AND
  SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

       IF YOUR BREATHING
       SUDDENLY WORSENS,
 YOUR THROAT OR TONGUE SWELLS,
     YOU GET HIVES, VISION
     CHANGES OR EYE PAIN,

   OR PROBLEMS PASSING URINE.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
  DRY MOUTH AND CONSTIPATION.
         NOTHING CAN
         REVERSE COPD.

        SPIRIVA HELPS ME
        BREATHE BETTER.
    DOES BREATHING WITH COPD
    WEIGH YOU DOWN?
      ASK YOUR DOCTOR
      IF SPIRIVA CAN HELP.

 So you're telling me he didn't
 win the batting title in 1935,
 but he won it in '38?
             I'm 99.9% positive.
So you don't know.

       I WISH MY PATIENTS
      COULD SEE WHAT I SEE.

         THAT OVER TIME,
     HAVING HIGH CHOLESTEROL
        PLUS DIABETES...
        OR FAMILY HISTORY
    OF EARLY HEART DISEASE...

 CAN PUT THEM AT INCREASED RISK
       FOR PLAQUE BUILDUP.
         AND THEY'D SEE
    THAT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
    TO GET THEIR CHOLESTEROL

    WHERE THEIR DOCTOR WANTS.
   AND WHY FOR THESE PATIENTS,
     WHEN DIET AND EXERCISE
      ALONE AREN'T ENOUGH,

      I PRESCRIBE CRESTOR.
         ADDING CRESTOR
     LOWERS BAD CHOLESTEROL
          BY UP TO 52%.

       AND IS ALSO PROVEN
     TO SLOW PLAQUE BUILDUP.
