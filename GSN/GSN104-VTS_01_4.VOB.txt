       We have product X

   We are going to start with
           product X.

   The only thing I'll let you
    know is  that it is an,
      affordable product.
        Oh, I like that.

  Let's move on to product Y,
 which is a far more expensive
            product.
 Whoaaa. I don't care for that
            at all.

             Yuck.
    You picked X and it was

   and Y was the competitor.

  Is that something you would
