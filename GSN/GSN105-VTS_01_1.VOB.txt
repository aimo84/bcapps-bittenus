$50,

      THE $100,
OR EVEN $25,000 IN IT.
     THE MOST ROMANTIC CITY
         IN THE WORLD,
    HERE COME THE NEWLYWEDS!

     AND NOW, THE CONDUCTOR
      OF THIS LOVE TRAIN,
        SHERRI SHEPHERD!
       - HELLO. HI, GUYS.
              HI.

       HELLO, NEWLYWEDS!
              HI!
     [cheers and applause]
           ALL RIGHT.

        THANK YOU, GARY.
  WELCOME TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>
         THE SHOW WHERE
      TOO MUCH INFORMATION

        IS NEVER ENOUGH.
         SO LET'S MEET
  TONIGHT'S COMPETING COUPLES.
           - SHERRI,
    MEET COUPLE NUMBER ONE.

       VINNIE AND ELYSSA
  MET SINGING THEIR HEARTS OUT
       AT A KARAOKE BAR.
      NOW THEY BELT IT OUT
  IN THE BEDROOM EVERY NIGHT,

       WHICH IS A BIG HIT
      WITH THE NEIGHBORS.
       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
       JUDE AND VANESSA--
SHE HAS A FANTASY TO SEDUCE HIM
         AT HIS OFFICE,

         BUT HE THINKS
     THAT'S UNPROFESSIONAL.
     HE'S RIGHT. REAL PROS
    USE THE CONFERENCE ROOM.
    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
       JOSE AND TERESA--

       SHE'S GOT A THING
    FOR BASKETBALL PLAYERS,
     THOUGH HE DOESN'T HAVE
           MUCH GAME.
         BUT HE'LL WEAR
        HIGH-TOPS TO BED

    IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES
           TO SCORE.
      BACK TO YOU, SHERRI.
     - ALL RIGHT, COUPLES,
  WELCOME TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>

    GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU.
 NOW, LADIES, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
 TO STAND UP AND GO BACKSTAGE.
      LEAVE YOUR HUBBIES.

       WE GOT TO ASK 'EM
        SOME QUESTIONS.
     [cheers and applause]
        ALL RIGHT, GUYS,

      I'M GONNA ASK Y'ALL
        THREE QUESTIONS,
  AND IT'S GONNA BE UP TO YOUR
  WIVES TO MATCH YOUR ANSWERS.
THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST POINTS
     AT THE END OF THE GAME

      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
       SECOND HONEYMOON.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.
         - HERE WE GO.

  WHEN DOES YOUR WIFE TAKE THE
 LONGEST TO GET TO THE POINT--
  WHEN SHE'S TELLING A STORY,
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING AN ARGUMENT,
     OR WHEN YOU'RE IN BED?

            VINNIE?
    - I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY
       WHEN WE'RE IN BED.
             - AH.

    - 'CAUSE THE FIRST TWO--
  IF WE GET INTO THE ARGUMENT,
  I GET YELLED AT IMMEDIATELY,
     AND IT'S VERY SPECIFIC
           AS TO WHY.

            - OKAY,
    AND THEN IN BED, THOUGH?
   - IN BED, I DON'T GIVE UP
       VERY FAST AT ALL.
            - YEAH.

       - SO THEN IT GOES
    ALL THE WAY TO THE END.
            - OKAY.
   AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, JUDE?
         - WHEN SHE'S--
   WE'RE HAVING AN ARGUMENT,

AND THE REASON IT TAKES SO LONG
     TO GET TO THE POINT IS
   SHE HAS TO REPEAT A POINT
   ABOUT 10, 12 TIMES, SO...
      IT'S THE SAME POINT,
     BUT IT TAKES SO LONG,

 SO I HAVE TO CHOOSE THAT ONE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT ABOUT YOU, JOSE?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
        IN AN ARGUMENT,

         'CAUSE I JUST
    HAVE TROUBLE LISTENING.
           I JUST...
          - SO YOU GO
  TO THE OLD ZONE-OUT FEATURE.

            - YEAH,
    BUT SHE DON'T PLAY THAT.
   - DOES SHE SAY YOUR NAME,
      LIKE, 12 OR 13 TIMES
          SO YOU CAN--
       - YEAH. OH, YEAH.

     - HOW DOES SHE SAY IT
       WHEN SHE SAYS IT?
          - [grunting]
  "JOSE, I'M TALKING TO YOU."
           [laughter]

       "JOSE." YOU KNOW.
"I'M TALKING TO YOU." YOU KNOW.
   SHE GETS THAT--SHE GRUNT.
    - YOU KNOW IT'S TROUBLE
  WHEN SHE SAYS IT LIKE THAT.

     - I KNOW IT'S TROUBLE.
        - NOW A QUESTION
       FROM THENEST.COM,
   THE FIRST NAME IN WEBSITES
         FOR NEWLYWEDS.

    WHEN YOU FIRST LAID EYES
         ON YOUR WIFE,
   WHAT WAS IT ABOUT HER THAT
 REALLY CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION?
             JUDE?
          - HER SMILE.

          - HER SMILE?
 - SHE IS RADIANT LIKE THE SUN
     EVERY TIME I SEE HER.
     SHE'S ALWAYS GLOWING.
 SHE'S EXTREMELY AFFECTIONATE.

 UH, SHE'S THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.
            - YEAH.
      - IT'S PURE ROMANCE.
        IT HASN'T DIED.

  SO I HAVE TO SAY HER SMILE.
        - WAIT A MINUTE.
            HOLD ON.
    TRUE ROMANCE THAT HAS...
          I LOVE THAT.

    I GOT TO WRITE THAT DOWN
   AND GIVE IT TO A BOYFRIEND
         TO SAY TO ME.
        ALL RIGHT, JOSE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - UH, IT WOULD BE, UM,
           HER BUTT.
          - HER BUTT.
             - YES.
  - WHAT IS IT ABOUT HER BUTT?

          - IT'S BIG.
        IT'S A BIG BUTT.
       - YOU KNOW, THAT'S
   THE FIRST THING THAT I SAW
   WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
            - YEAH?

    - YOU KNOW, SHE TURNED--
    SHE ASKED ME A QUESTION.
  AND THEN AS SHE WALKED AWAY,
            I SAID,
   "MAN, I GOT TO HIT THAT."

           [laughter]
      I'M KEEPING IT REAL.
      - THAT IS WHAT WE DO
      ON <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>

        WE KEEP IT REAL.
     - I'M KEEPING IT REAL.
   - VINNIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - SHERRI, I'M GONNA GO
TO THE FRONT AND SAY HER BOOBS.

          - HER BOOBS.
            - BOOBS.
      - TELL ME ABOUT 'EM.
    - THE FIRST TIME WE MET,
      I WANTED TO GO HOME.

  I WAS TIRED, BUT I SAW HER,
    AND I LOCKED IN ON 'EM,
        AND THAT WAS IT
     THE REST OF THE NIGHT.
           - REALLY?
   - I'M FASCINATED BY THEM.

- OKAY, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ASK
 HER SOME MORE ABOUT HER BOOBS.
           ALL RIGHT,
   FINAL QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
     FINISH THIS SENTENCE.

        "LITTLE BO PEEP
        LOST HER SHEEP,
     BUT MY WIFE IS ALWAYS
       LOSING HER BLANK."
             JOSE?

         - UH, CLOTHES?
           I DON'T...
        - OKAY. GOT YOU.
            VINNIE?

  - I'M GONNA SAY HER TEMPER,
         'CAUSE SHE HAS
    A VERY, VERY SHORT FUSE.
           - REALLY?
          - OH, YEAH.

      SHE LOSES HER TEMPER
         ALL THE TIME.
           - OH, MAN.
        ALL RIGHT. JUDE?
  - SHE LOSES HER HOUSE KEYS,
    HER KEYS, ALL THE TIME.

       AND I'VE GOT THREE
    OR FOUR COPIES OF THEM,
    AND I TRY TO TELL HER--
  - PUT 'EM IN THE SAME PLACE.
   - BRING A COUPLE WITH YOU.

   AT LEAST YOU'LL HAVE ONE,
       BUT IT'S THE KEYS.
 - WOWEE. ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
           NICE JOB.
      WHILE WE'RE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,

         GARY, TELL US
ALL ABOUT THAT SECOND HONEYMOON.
      - TONIGHT'S WINNERS
ARE GOING TO MARQUIS LOS CABOS,
        A LUXURY RESORT
  ON MEXICO'S BAJA PENINSULA.

            FEATURES
  A WORLD-CLASS HOLISTIC SPA,
   EXCLUSIVE GOURMET DINING,
         OVER 40 POOLS,
    AN EXTENSIVE COLLECTION
OF LATIN AMERICAN ART, AND MORE.

       MARQUIS LOS CABOS.
             ENJOY.
 - AND THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     EARNS YOU FIVE POINTS,

         SO HERE WE GO.
           - LADIES,
   ACCORDING TO YOUR HUSBAND,
  WHEN DO YOU TAKE THE LONGEST
     TO GET TO THE POINT--

  WHEN YOU'RE TELLING A STORY,
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING AN ARGUMENT,
     OR WHEN YOU'RE IN BED?
            ELYSSA?

           - [laughs]
     WELL, I'M AN ATTORNEY,
      SO I'M NOT GONNA GO
   WITH ONE OF THOSE CHOICES,
     HOWEVER I'M GONNA SAY,
     "C," THE THIRD ANSWER.

     - WHEN YOU'RE IN BED?
      - WHEN WE'RE IN BED.
  - AH, YOU TAKE THE LONGEST?
         - IT TAKES ME
      A LITTLE CARESSING.

            - YEAH?
     BEFORE YOU'RE FINALLY
 AT THE CLOSING ARGUMENT, HUH?
        - YES, EXACTLY.
          - ALL RIGHT.

    VINNIE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            IN BED.
             YEAH.

     [cheers and applause]
      - THAT WAS AWESOME.
        - OKAY, VANESSA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         - I WOULD SAY
    WHEN HAVING AN ARGUMENT,

   BECAUSE WHENEVER WE ARGUE,
  I HAVE TO GIVE A LONG STORY
        AND EXPLANATION
     AS TO WHY I'M CORRECT,
      WHICH I USUALLY AM.

         I HAVE TO SAY.
      - OKAY, WELL, JUDE,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
      HAVING AN ARGUMENT.
             - YES.

   - TERESA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - UM, I'D HAVE TO SAY
 WHEN WE'RE HAVING AN ARGUMENT,
BECAUSE I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT.

      AND THEN I'M NOT ONE
 FOR THE ANGRY STUFF, YOU KNOW.
        I GOT TO KNOW--
  MY BRAIN'S GOT TO BE IN IT.
       I GOT TO BE READY.

    - DOES HE LISTEN TO YOU
WHEN YOU'RE HAVING AN ARGUMENT?
           - NO. NO.
    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, JOSE?

      HAVING AN ARGUMENT.
             YEAH.
         - YEAH, BABY.
     [cheers and applause]
        - OKAY, LADIES,
        SECOND QUESTION.

         NOW A QUESTION
       FROM THENEST.COM,
   THE FIRST NAME IN WEBSITES
         FOR NEWLYWEDS.
       WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
    FIRST LAID EYES ON YOU,

     WHAT WAS IT ABOUT YOU
      THAT HE SAID REALLY
     CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION?
            VANESSA.

      - PROBABLY THE SHIRT
       THAT I WAS WEARING
   THAT DIDN'T LOOK TOO GOOD,
        THAT STUCK OUT,
           AND HE HAD
     TO BRING IT UP LATER.

     - WHAT WAS THE SHIRT?
      - HE SAID IT LOOKED
         LIKE AN APRON.
          - ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

       - IT'S YOUR SMILE.
    - I WAS GONNA SAY THAT!
      - I LOVE YOUR SMILE.
             - OH.
       - CAN YOU TELL ME

         WHAT YOU SAID
    ABOUT YOUR WIFE'S SMILE?
        - I SAID YOU'RE
      THE LOVE OF MY LIFE.
      YOUR SMILE'S LIKE--

        IT'S SO RADIANT,
       IT'S LIKE THE SUN.
      IT SHINES EVERY DAY.
IT MAKES ME LOVE YOU THAT MUCH.
             - AW.

        - OH, I LOVE IT.
    - I WAS GONNA SAY THAT.
            - OKAY,
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, TERESA.
   - I'D HAVE TO SAY MY BUTT.

        - PLEASE TELL ME
        ABOUT THIS BUTT.
 - IT'S THE PUERTO RICAN IN ME.
        WHAT CAN I SAY?
            - YEAH.
     - IT'S MY BEST ASSET.

            [laughs]
     WHEN DID HE FIRST SEE
    THIS SAID BUTT OF YOURS?
         - HIGH SCHOOL.

       - IN HIGH SCHOOL?
 - IN HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR YEAR.
        WE WERE TALKING
       IN THE CAFETERIA.
        I TURNED AROUND,
       AND THERE IT WAS.

            - YEAH?
      SO YOU KNEW SHE KNEW
      THAT WAS THE WEAPON
      OF MASS DESTRUCTION
          RIGHT THERE.

          - OH, YEAH.
        - YOU KNEW THAT.
          SHE GOT YOU.
         - ABSOLUTELY.

    - AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           HER BUTT.
     [cheers and applause]
            - OKAY.

    ELYSSA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         - I'M GONNA GO
  WITH MY CURLY HAIR, MY FRO.
            - YEAH?
             - YES.

 I THINK THAT HE WAS ENTRANCED
        BY ALL OF THIS.
       - WERE YOU STARING
         AT THAT HAIR?
             - NO.

          UH, COME ON.
     - HE SAID YOUR BOOBS.
- ELYSSA, COME ON, I ALWAYS TALK
       ABOUT YOUR BOOBS.

         - OH, COME ON.
           MY BOOBS?
     - YEAH, I ALWAYS TALK
       - YOU ALWAYS TALK
ABOUT HOW YOU LOVE MY BIG HAIR.

 - I DO LOVE YOUR HAIR, BUT...
          - BIG BOOBS.
       - I GOT YOUR BOOBS
       BEFORE YOUR HAIR.
          - IT'S TRUE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION,
            COUPLES.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
     FINISH THIS SENTENCE?

        "LITTLE BO PEEP
        LOST HER SHEEP,
     BUT MY WIFE IS ALWAYS
       LOSING HER BLANK."
            TERESA?

        - MY CELL PHONE.
       - YOU ALWAYS LOSE
        YOUR CELL PHONE?
  - ALWAYS LOSE MY CELL PHONE.

          IT'S ALWAYS
    SOMEWHERE IN THE HOUSE.
  IT'S THE ONLY PHONE WE HAVE,
   SO IT'S, LIKE--IT'S ALWAYS
   ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER...

           - UH-HUH.
      - OR IN THE BEDROOM
           OR BETWEEN
      THE SOFA SOMEWHERE.
            - OKAY.
     JOSE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

         - HER CLOTHES.
        - YOUR CLOTHES.
- I'M ALWAYS LOSING MY CLOTHES?
      - YOUR WORK OUTFITS.

          - OH, OKAY.
            - OKAY.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, ELYSSA?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
   I'M ALWAYS LOSING MY MIND.

     - WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
      - UM, I DON'T KNOW.
  HE'S ALWAYS CALLING ME CRAZY
        FOR SOME REASON,
       SO I FIGURE, LIKE,

 IT MUST BE BECAUSE I'M LOSING
     MY MIND HALF THE TIME.
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.
      - ALL RIGHT, VINNIE,
         IS SHE CRAZY?

       - SHE'S NOT CRAZY,
 BUT SHE DOES LOOSE HER TEMPER.
         - HER TEMPER.
- 'CAUSE YOU GET SO MAD SO EASY.
         IN THE CAR...

       - I DO. NO, IT'S--
      YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
        - OKAY, VANESSA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I'D HAVE TO SAY MY KEYS,
   WHICH I'VE LOST RIGHT NOW.

       I'M ALWAYS LOOKING
          FOR MY KEYS.
      AND THEY'RE USUALLY
   IN MY DIAPER BAG, ANYWAY.
- REALLY? SO YOU LOSE YOUR KEYS
         ALL THE TIME?

   - WHEN YOU'RE TAKING CARE
          OF A BABY...
    I'VE GOT TWO CHILDREN--
    MY HUSBAND AND MY BABY.
   - WHAT'D YOUR HUSBAND SAY?

    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, HONEY?
          - YOUR KEYS.
      - HE SAID THE KEYS!
       HE SAID THE KEYS.

     ALL RIGHT, MY COUPLES.
        WOW. ALL RIGHT,
     COUPLE TWO AND THREE,
   YOU GUYS HAVE TEN POINTS--
   YOU'RE TIED FOR THE LEAD.

       COUPLE NUMBER ONE,
        IT'S ALL RIGHT.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT'S THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,

         AND THIS TIME
     WE DOUBLE THE POINTS.
      KEEP IT RIGHT HERE.
     - THIS ROMANCE MOMENT
IS PRESENTED BY REEDS JEWELERS.

         SHOW YOUR LOVE
    WITH A GIFT FROM REEDS.
They're two of a kind.

      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,
  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.

 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,

BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)

    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,
      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.

 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.
   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING

AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK

     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,
    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,

OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.
    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,

     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,
    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.

  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.
  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.

HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.
 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       IT IS TIME FOR YOU

   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
           HERE WE GO
    WITH THE FIRST QUESTION.

  EVERY GUY WANTS MORE ACTION
      BETWEEN THE SHEETS,
       SO WHICH OF THESE
         WOULD YOUR MAN
        ASK FOR MORE OF
        IN THE BEDROOM--

     VARIETY, SPONTANEITY,
         OR GENEROSITY?
            ELYSSA?
       - UM, I'M GONNA GO
        WITH GENEROSITY,

     'CAUSE HE'S--YOU KNOW,
    HE LIKES TO BE CARESSED,
AND I PROBABLY COULD DO A LITTLE
  BIT MORE OF THAT DOWN THERE,
             SO...
          - OH, YEAH?

        MORE GENEROSITY.
            GOT YOU.
            VANESSA?
   - I WOULD SAY SPONTANEITY.

         - SPONTANEITY?
         - ABSOLUTELY.
       I THINK MY HUSBAND
LIKES TO KNOW WHAT IS EXPECTED,
      WHAT'S COMING NEXT.

  - OKAY, SO MORE SPONTANEITY.
      - MORE SPONTANEITY.
            - OKAY.
    TERESA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - SPONTANEITY, FOR SURE.
          - SPON--WHY?

      - 'CAUSE EVEN THOUGH
        WE HAVE TO FIND
           ALL KINDS
     OF PLACES TO DO THAT,
     IT'S THE TIMES TO FIND
           TO DO IT.

    - 'CAUSE YOU GOT A BABY.
         - WHEN YOU GOT

       YOU GUYS ARE TIED
FOR FIRST PLACE WITH TEN POINTS.
        YOU'RE FOLLOWED
      BY COUPLE NUMBER ONE
       WITH FIVE POINTS,
        BUT IT IS OKAY,

    BECAUSE HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
  EVERY GUY WANTS MORE ACTION
      BETWEEN THE SHEETS.
       SO WHICH OF THESE
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY

   YOU WOULD ASK FOR MORE OF
        IN THE BEDROOM--
          SPONTANEITY,
    VARIETY, OR GENEROSITY?
            VINNIE?

 - OH, UH, I THINK SPONTANEITY
        WITHOUT A DOUBT.
             - WHY?
 - I THINK IT'S MOSTLY PLANNED.
 MOST OF THE TIME I FEEL LIKE--

       RECENTLY IT'S BEEN
         EITHER PLANNED
   OR JUST, UH, VERY FORMULA.
     - HINT, HINT, ELYSSA.
            [laughs]

      WHAT DID ELYSSA SAY?
          GENEROSITY.
      - WHAT THE [bleep]?
    - YOU ALWAYS ARE SAYING
  HOW YOU WISH I WOULD, LIKE,
  DO MORE IN THAT AREA, SO...

    - BUT DON'T YOU THINK--
  'CAUSE SHE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.
SHE WAS JUST LIKE, "YES, I HAVE
 TO DO MORE IN THAT, YOU KNOW,
    DOWN SLOPE, DOWNHILL..."

    - I APPRECIATE IT, SO--
         I'LL TAKE IT.
    I WILL TAKE IT, SHERRI.
         - YOU'RE LIKE,
   "WE MAY NOT GET THE POINT,

   BUT I'LL TAKE THE--YEAH."
    - I'LL TAKE GENEROSITY.
      - YEAH. I HEAR YOU.
     JUDE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

         - I HAVE TO GO
       WITH SPONTANEITY,
     BUT I ALSO HAVE TO SAY
   THAT SHE'S THE ONE THAT'S
   ALWAYS SPONTANEOUS, SO...

       - WHY YOU BLOCKING
        THE SPONTANEITY?
     - WELL, I DON'T THINK
        I'M BLOCKING IT.
   I THINK SHE'S DOING GREAT
     WITH THE SPONTANEITY,

        BUT I DON'T KNOW
       WHAT ELSE TO SAY.
         THERE'S NOT--
  WE'RE NOT HAVING A PROBLEM,
       SO IT SOUNDS LIKE
       I GOT TO PICK ONE.

    I MEAN, WE'RE--WE'RE...
         - JUDE'S LIKE,
   "I'M JUST GONNA PICK ONE."
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
          SPONTANEITY.

     [cheers and applause]
             OKAY.
     JOSE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

         - GENEROSITY.
 - GENEROSITY. WHY GENEROSITY?
    - I'M GENEROUS WITH IT.
       - THAT'S VERY NICE
         OF YOU TO SAY.

  SO YOU'RE GENEROUS WITH IT,
   BUT TERESA NEEDS TO HAVE--
       GIVE A LITTLE BIT
        MORE GENEROSITY.
       SHE NEEDS TO HAVE
   MORE GENEROSITY GOING ON.

   WHAT DID YOU SAY, TERESA?
          SPONTANEITY.
           ALL RIGHT.

  THESE PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND.
           [laughter]

   SO HERE WE GO, GENTLEMEN.

       HOW MUCH PREP TIME
 DOES YOUR LITTLE SHOWMAN NEED
       BEFORE HE'S READY
        TO GET ONSTAGE--
           5 MINUTES,

          15 MINUTES,
      OR HE'S ALWAYS READY
         FOR SHOWTIME?
            PATRICK?

       - I'M ALWAYS READY
      FOR SHOWTIME, BABY.
             - OHH!
           - ALWAYS.
    - RYAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - I'M GONNA CONTINUE
           THE TREND
       AND SAY I'M READY
   TO GO PRETTY MUCH ANYTIME.
           - ANYTIME?
     - ANYTIME. YEAH, YEAH.

  - OKAY, AND YOU ARE SMILING
     ABOUT IT. LOOK AT YOU.
       - I'M JUST HOPING
   THAT'S WHAT SHE SAYS TOO.
    - KYLE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

         - READY TO GO
     ALL THE TIME, ANYTIME.
    - ALL THE TIME, ANYTIME?
             - YEP.
       - NO MATTER WHAT--
       RAIN, SLEET, SNOW?

         - ABSOLUTELY.
      THE MORE THE BETTER.
    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
         NEXT QUESTION.
   IF WE SLAPPED A GOLD STAR
         YOUR FOREHEAD

    FOR EVERY TIME YOU SAID
      "I LOVE YOU" TODAY,
      HOW MANY GOLD STARS
WOULD YOU BE WEARING RIGHT NOW?
             RYAN?

          - RIGHT NOW.
       LET'S SEE, WELL...
    I USUALLY SAY THAT RIGHT
 IN THE MORNING WHEN WE GET UP,
           AND, UH...

       I'D SAY PROBABLY--
      I'M GONNA SAY THREE.
   - THREE STARS, ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT ABOUT YOU, KYLE?
  - I'M ALSO GONNA SAY THREE,

      'CAUSE WE SPENT MOST
   OF THE DAY TOGETHER TODAY,
         SO ALSO THREE.
       - OKAY, SO THREE.
            PATRICK?

    - I'D SAY AT LEAST TEN.
   - AT LEAST TEN GOLD STARS?
            - YEAH.
  ALL THE TIME, ALL THE TIME.

        - GOOD FOR YOU.
        TEN GOLD STARS.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
  IF YOU THINK A CATEGORY-FIVE
    HURRICANE IS A DISASTER,
     YOU SHOULD SEE MY WIFE
        WHEN SHE BLANKS.

             KYLE?
  - [laughs] WOW. THAT'S EASY,
       'CAUSE, ACTUALLY--
  I'VE KIND OF NICKNAMED NIKKI
      AS HURRICANE NIKKI,

  'CAUSE EVERYWHERE SHE GOES,
  SHE'S A DISASTER OF A MESS.
  SO AS LONG AS SHE'S A AWAKE,
     I GUESS YOU WOULD SAY.
      - SO YOU'RE SAYING,

     YOU SHOULD SEE MY WIFE
       WHEN SHE'S AWAKE?
             - YES.
           [laughter]

             - WOW.
           ALL RIGHT.
            PATRICK,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
  FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
  LIKE, WHEN SHE DOES NOT WANT
       TO GET OUT OF BED,
      SHE'LL HIT "SNOOZE"
        ABOUT TEN TIMES.

     I HAVE TO MORE OR LESS
   GET HER UP TO GET TO WORK,
            SO I SAY
  FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
   - OKAY, SO YOU SHOULD SEE
   MY WIFE WHEN SHE WAKES UP?

    - GETTING UP OUT OF BED.
           - GOT YOU.
    - IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGHT.
    - ALL RIGHT, AND, RYAN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - I'M GONNA SAY WHEN
  SHE HAS ONE TOO MANY DRINKS.
             UH...
            [laughs]
     MAYBE A FEW DRINKS IN,
          SHE'S FINE,

       AND THEN THAT ONE
 THAT PUTS HER OVER THE LIMIT,
     SHE STARTS, YOU KNOW,
   STARTING FIGHTS AND STUFF
   THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
SHE'S FIGHTING ABOUT, AND SO...

            - SHE IS
    A LITTLE SPITFIRE, HUH?
        - YEAH, SHE GETS
  A LITTLE FEISTY AFTER THAT--
         THAT ONE DRINK
  THAT PUTS HER OVER THE EDGE.

     - SO IT'S WHEN--SO YOU
 SHOULD SEE MY WIFE WHEN SHE--
     - ONE TOO MANY DRINKS.
        - OKAY, GOT YOU.
       ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
           NICE JOB.

    NOW, WHILE WE'RE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,
    GARY, WOULD YOU TELL US
ALL ABOUT THAT SECOND HONEYMOON
   THAT THEY'RE PLAYING FOR?

      - TONIGHT'S WINNERS
           ARE GOING
       TO THE OMNI CANCUN
         HOTEL & VILLAS
    IN THE HEART OF CANCUN,
  MEXICO'S FABLED HOTEL ZONE.

     IT'S THE IDEAL RESORT
       FOR TRUE ROMANCE.
          OVERLOOKING
   THE STUNNING CARIBBEAN SEA
      AND OFFERING GENUINE
MEXICAN HOSPITALITY AND FLAVOR,

  YOU WILL BE FOREVER IN LOVE
       AT THE OMNI CANCUN
        HOTEL & VILLAS.
     [cheers and applause]

       - OH, THAT SOUNDS
           SO YUMMY.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
   NOW, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,

     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     EARNS YOU FIVE POINTS,
         SO HERE WE GO.

   LADIES, HOW MUCH PREP TIME
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
    HIS LITTLE SHOWMAN NEEDS
       BEFORE HE'S READY
        TO GET ONSTAGE--

     5 MINUTES, 15 MINUTES,
         OR HE'S ALWAYS
      READY FOR SHOWTIME?
            MARIELY,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

           - I THINK
       HE MIGHT HAVE SAID
       HE'S ALWAYS READY
         FOR SHOWTIME,
      BECAUSE HE REALLY IS
   ALWAYS READY FOR SHOWTIME.

             - OH!
   REALLY, NOT ONE TIME DOES
 HE NEED ANY KIND OF PREP TIME?
    - NO, NOT WITH THIS ONE.
          NO, NO, NO.

   - NOT WITH THIS ONE, HUH?
           ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   ALWAYS READY FOR SHOWTIME.

     [cheers and applause]
     BECCA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I AM ALSO GONNA SAY
   ALWAYS READY FOR SHOWTIME.

           - REALLY?
      - YOU KNOW, BECAUSE
HE'S A SWING IN HIS PROFESSION,
      LIKE HE JUST GOES ON
     AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE,

   KIND OF LIKE A MINUTEMAN,
           YOU KNOW.
        SO HE'S REALLY--
       HE'S ALWAYS READY.
   - NOW, DOES THAT SUIT YOU?
     - I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

  - YOU'RE ALL RIGHT WITH IT?
   ALL RIGHT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       HE'S ALWAYS READY
         FOR SHOWTIME.
             - YAY!

     [cheers and applause]
      - ALL RIGHT, NIKKI,
      HERE WE ARE TO YOU.
       - I'M GOING TO SAY
           THE SAME,

   ALWAYS READY FOR SHOWTIME.
            - YEAH?
   - I CAN GIVE HIM A KISS ON
THE CHEEK, AND HE'S READY TO GO.
    - AND HE'S READY TO GO?

      AW, THAT'S SO CUTE.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   ALWAYS READY FOR SHOWTIME.

     [cheers and applause]
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       YOU KNOW YOUR MEN.
             OKAY.

         OKAY, LADIES,
   IF WE SLAPPED A GOLD STAR
   ON YOUR HUSBAND'S FOREHEAD
         FOR EVERY TIME
  HE SAID "I LOVE YOU" TODAY,

      HOW MANY GOLD STARS
 WOULD HE BE WEARING RIGHT NOW?
             BECCA?
            - THREE.

       - THREE. SO, RYAN,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
       THREE GOLD STARS.
            - YEAH!

     [cheers and applause]
         - OKAY, NIKKI?

            - FIVE?
            - YEAH.
       - WHEN DID HE SAY
         HE LOVED YOU?

       OH, WELL, HE SAID
       THREE GOLD STARS.
              OHH.
         OKAY, MARIELY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - WOW, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
   UM, HE'S SUCH A SWEET GUY.
     HE'S ALWAYS TELLING ME
       THAT HE LOVES ME,
      AND IT'S NOT THE END
          OF THE DAY,

        SO I'M PROBABLY
    GONNA SAY, LIKE, FIVE...
      - LIKE, FIVE TIMES?
      - TIMES TODAY? YEAH.
       - WHAT'D YOU SAY?

        TEN GOLD STARS.
     - I WAS GONNA SAY TEN.
          - YOU WERE?
      - YES, I REALLY WAS!

  - THAT'S ONLY HALF THE DAY,
        SO THAT COUNTS.
        - IT'S ONLY HALF
         THE DAY, GIRL.
     HOW COME YOU DIDN'T GO
      WITH THE WHOLE DAY?

        - I SHOULD HAVE.
            - YEAH.
           ALL RIGHT,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
  LADIES, HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

  IF YOU THINK A CATEGORY-FIVE
    HURRICANE IS A DISASTER,
     YOU SHOULD SEE MY WIFE
        WHEN SHE BLANKS.
             NIKKI?

        - WHEN I DRINK?
     - MMM. SO WHAT HAPPENS
     WHEN YOU DRINK, GIRL?
  - I CAN GET A LITTLE MESSY--
         I DON'T KNOW.

           - [laughs]
     OKAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       WHEN YOU'RE AWAKE.

           [laughter]
        - IT'S SO TRUE,
        AND YOU KNOW IT.
       EVERYWHERE YOU GO,
        IT'S A DISASTER.

          - I'M AWAKE
  WHEN I'M DRINKING, KIND OF.
     - MMM, NO, WE CAN'T--
     - MAYBE NOT MENTALLY,
        BUT PHYSICALLY.

      - WE CAN'T TAKE IT.
           ALL RIGHT,
   WHAT DO YOU SAY, MARIELY?
   - I'M DEFINITELY GONNA GO
     WITH DRINK THIS TIME,

 BECAUSE I DO GET KIND OF LIKE
  A CATEGORY-FIVE HURRICANE...
    - WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING?
     - WHEN I DRINK, YEAH.
        - OKAY, PATRICK,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       WHEN YOU WAKE UP.
     - YOU'RE A NIGHTMARE.
       - I WANT TO KNOW--
    WHAT ARE YOU LADIES LIKE

        WHEN YOU GET UP
        IN THE MORNING?
  ARE YOU, LIKE, REALLY EVIL?
        WHAT'S GOING ON?
         - NO, I'M NOT.

        - YES, YOU ARE.
    - NO, I'M NOT, PATRICK.
        - YOU DON'T WANT
         TO GO TO WORK.
      - I'M SUCH A SAINT.
         I'M AN ANGEL.

      - ALL RIGHT, BECCA,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
            - WELL,
    I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT,
     AND NOW I WANT TO SAY
        SOMETHING ELSE.

          I'M GONNA GO
      WITH WHEN I WAKE UP.
       - YOU'RE GONNA GO
   WITH WHEN YOU WAKE UP TOO?
  - NO, THAT'S JUST THE FIRST
 THING THAT POPPED IN MY HEAD,

           SO I THINK
    I SHOULD STICK WITH IT.
 - ALL RIGHT, WELL, THEN, RYAN,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
        WHEN YOU'VE HAD
      ONE TOO MANY DRINKS.

         WHAT THE HECK?
          WHAT? BECCA!
   ALL RIGHT, AND AT THE END
         OF THIS ROUND,

    WE'RE GONNA CONGRATULATE
        RYAN AND BECCA.

        WITH TEN POINTS,

        IT IS YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.

        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
          HERE WE GO.
        IN HIGH SCHOOL,
   WHAT TYPE OF FIGHTER PILOT

         DID THE LADIES
     SEE YOUR HUSBAND AS--
         A TOP GUN ACE,
           A WINGMAN
       WITH A FEW KILLS,

      OR A NOVICE WHO DID
        MOST OF HIS WORK
         ON HIS AT-HOME
       FLIGHT SIMULATOR?
           [laughter]

            MARIELY?
          - UM, WELL,
       HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?
      A TOP MAN, FOR SURE.

             - OH!
      - DEFINITELY, YEAH.
       - SO YOU'RE SAYING
         A TOP GUN ACE.
     - YES, HE WAS TOTALLY
    A TOP GUN ACE, FOR SURE.

            - OKAY.
     BECCA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I ALSO AM GONNA SAY
         A TOP GUN ACE.

          HE ACTUALLY
     WANTED TO BE A PILOT.
    HIS GRANDFATHER WAS ONE.
         - OH, REALLY?
      - SO--I KNOW THAT'S,
     LIKE, LITERAL, BUT...

       - NO, BUT, YEAH--
         A TOP GUN ACE.
       OKAY. AND, NIKKI,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I'M ALSO GONNA SAY

        - A TOP GUN ACE?
      - HE WAS DEFINITELY
 A LADIES' MAN IN HIGH SCHOOL.
        - SO NOBODY WAS
   ON THEIR FLIGHT SIMULATOR

   AT HOME BY THEMSELF, HUH?
              NO!
          YOU'RE LIKE,
    "NOT MY HUSBAND, MM-MM."

       AND NOW A QUESTION
   FROM AIR WICK SCENTED OILS
    WINTER LUXURY EDITION--
   A COLLECTION OF INDULGENT
      SEASONAL FRAGRANCES.

  AS A TREAT, YOUR HUSBAND HAS
HIRED A WEEKLY CLEANING SERVICE.
        ARE YOU RELIEVED
         FOR THE HELP,
 UNCOMFORTABLE HAVING STRANGERS
         IN YOUR HOME,

  OR CLEANING LIKE A MADWOMAN
  THE DAY BEFORE THEY ARRIVE?
             BECCA?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
    CLEANING LIKE A MADWOMAN

  THE DAY BEFORE THEY ARRIVE.
           - GOT YOU.
     NIKKI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I'M GONNA SAY RELIEVED.
           [giggles]

        THE ONLY REASON
       I'M GONNA SAY THAT
    IS BECAUSE HE'LL BE ABLE
     TO RELAX A LITTLE BIT
    AND NOT HAVE TO CLEAN UP
           AFTER ME.

      SOMEBODY WILL CLEAN
AFTER THE BOTH OF US, ACTUALLY.
           - GOT YOU.
            MARIELY?
   - I'M GONNA SAY RELIEVED,

          BECAUSE HE'S
      KIND OF A MESSY ONE,
      AND I'M THE ONLY ONE
  THAT DOES ALL THE CLEANING,
  SO HE SHOULD DEFINITELY GET
ME ONE, AND I WILL BE RELIEVED.

            - OKAY.
       ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
   OUR NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
           PHOTOSHOP
    ALTERS CELEBRITY PHOTOS

      BEFORE THEY MAKE IT
        INTO MAGAZINES.
          SO TELL ME,
  BEFORE YOU GIVE YOUR HUSBAND
          A NUDE PHOTO
          OF YOURSELF,

     WHAT PART OF YOUR BODY
      WOULD YOU PHOTOSHOP?
             NIKKI?
      - PROBABLY MY BUTT.

          - YOUR BUTT?
             - YES.
            - YEAH?
    DOES HE LIKE YOUR BUTT?
     - HE DOES, BUT I WISH
    IT WAS A LITTLE SMALLER.

            - OKAY.
    MARIELY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - UM, I'M GONNA SAY
     MY BREASTS, MY BOOBS.

            - YEAH?
       - UM, I WOULD LIKE
     TO HAVE MAYBE BIGGER,
 AND I THINK HE WOULD LIKE THEM
     TO BE A LITTLE BIGGER.

      - ALL RIGHT, BECCA,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
  - OH, THIS IS EMBARRASSING.
        UM, I WOULD SAY
      PROBABLY MY THIGHS.

     - YOU'D PHOTOSHOP THEM
         JUST A LITTLE.
      - JUST A LITTLE BIT.
        - A LITTLE BIT.
           ALL RIGHT,
  NOW FOR OUR BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
      HERE WE GO, LADIES.
   IN THE MORNING, MY HUSBAND
  ABSOLUTELY NEEDS HIS BLANK,

         BUT AT NIGHT,
  HE ALWAYS SLEEPS LIKE A LOG
   RIGHT AFTER HE'S BLANKED.
            MARIELY?

   - RIGHT AFTER HE'S DRUNK.
   - RIGHT AFTER HE'S DRUNK?
   OKAY, NOW, IN THE MORNING,

      HE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS
           HIS BLANK.
        - HE NEEDS, UM,
        HIS BUM--MY BUM.
    HE CUDDLES INTO THE BUM.

      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
      - IN THE MORNING...
         WELL, HE NEEDS
          HIS COFFEE.

     - HE NEEDS HIS COFFEE.
      - AND, UH, AT NIGHT,
        HE FALLS ASLEEP
    RIGHT AFTER HE HAS READ.

      - AH, THERE YOU GO.
             NIKKI?
    - AT NIGHT, I WOULD SAY
        AFTER HE WATCHES
     HIS TiVo'D TV CHANNELS

          OR TV SHOWS.
  - OKAY, BUT IN THE MORNING,
         HE ABSOLUTELY
        NEEDS HIS BLANK.

       - IN THE MORNING,
 HE ABSOLUTELY NEEDS HIS PHONE.
HE CHECKS EVERYTHING--FACEBOOK,
    EVERYTHING ON HIS PHONE.
        - ON THAT PHONE.

      AND NOW, YOUR HOST,
        SHERRI SHEPHERD!

       - THANK YOU, GARY.
           ALL RIGHT,
       THE GUYS ARE BACK,
    SO LET'S SEE IF THE MEN
CAN MATCH WHAT THE LADIES SAID,

      SO HERE IS THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
   GENTLEMEN, IN HIGH SCHOOL,
   WHAT TYPE OF FIGHTER PILOT

      DOES YOUR WIFE THINK
    THE LADIES SAW YOU AS--
         A TOP GUN ACE,
           A WINGMAN
       WITH A FEW KILLS,

          OR A NOVICE
    WHO DID MOST OF HIS WORK
         ON HIS AT-HOME
       FLIGHT SIMULATOR?
            PATRICK,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

         - OH, IT WOULD
   HAVE TO BE A TOP GUN ACE.
     - IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
         A TOP GUN ACE?
  AND WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

        - WELL, I'M A--
      A BIT OF A FIGHTER.
            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.
       - ALL RIGHT, GIRL,
    YOU SAID A TOP GUN ACE.

         THERE YOU GO.
     [cheers and applause]
        ALL RIGHT, RYAN,
   YOU'RE OVER THERE SMILING.

      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
 WITH WINGMAN WITH A FEW KILLS.
           - AND WHAT
        WOULD BECCA SAY?

       SHE SAID YOU WERE
         A TOP GUN ACE.
           - OH! NO!
       - OVERESTIMATING.
            - YEAH.

         - HA. I SWEAR
      I DIDN'T LIE TO HER.
           - [laughs]
         ALL RIGHT, AND
   WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, KYLE?

         - TOP GUN ACE.
      - WHY WOULD YOU SAY
          TOP GUN ACE?
  - AT OUR WEDDING RECEPTION,
        I ACTUALLY, UH--

       MYSELF AND A BUNCH
         OF MY FRIENDS,
     WE ALL--AND I STARTED
          AS MAVERICK,
        SANG <i>YOU'VE LOST</i>
       <i>THAT LOVING FEELING</i>

     TO MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE.
             - AW!
  - SO TOM CRUISE STYLE, HUH?
             - YES.

    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, NIKKI?
          TOP GUN ACE.
     [cheers and applause]
             YEAH.

         LOOK AT NIKKI.
HE WAS LIKE, "YOU BETTER GIVE ME
   A GOOD KISS ON THAT ONE."
       AND NOW A QUESTION
   FROM AIR WICK SCENTED OILS

     WINTER LUXURY EDITION.
   AS A TREAT, YOU HAVE HIRED
   A WEEKLY CLEANING SERVICE.
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
SHE'D BE RELIEVED FOR THE HELP,

         UNCOMFORTABLE
 HAVING STRANGERS IN HER HOME,
  OR CLEANING LIKE A MADWOMAN
  THE DAY BEFORE THEY ARRIVED?
             RYAN?

     - I'M GONNA SAY SHE'D
 BE RELIEVED TO HAVE THE HELP.
            - YEAH?
        - BECAUSE, UH--
             YEAH,
   I MEAN, WE LIKE TO CLEAN,

     BUT, GOD, IF WE COULD
   HAVE SOMEONE DO IT FOR US,
     THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.
            - OKAY.
    BECCA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

       SHE SAID CLEANING
        LIKE A MADWOMAN
            THE DAY
      BEFORE THEY ARRIVED.
             - OHH!

   - AND I THINK IT'S BECAUSE
        YOU'RE SO MESSY.
      SHE'D BE CLEANING UP
          YOUR STUFF.
   - I THOUGHT THAT WAS WHAT
 THE PERSON WAS SUPPOSED TO DO.

        - YOU OBVIOUSLY
    DON'T UNDERSTAND WOMEN.
       - I'M SPEECHLESS.
           [laughter]
     - ALL RIGHT, GOT YOU.
     KYLE, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

      - RELIEVED, BECAUSE
     FINALLY SOMEBODY ELSE
          CAN HELP ME
      CLEAN UP AFTER HER.
          - ALL RIGHT,
    MY LITTLE DARLING NIKKI,

      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     RELIEVED FOR THE HELP.
     [cheers and applause]

            PATRICK,
    YOU'RE DEEP IN THOUGHT.
       WHAT DO YOU THINK?
    - YEAH, I'M NOT TOO SURE
  WHAT WAY TO SAY ON THAT ONE.

     I THINK MAYBE MY WIFE
  WOULD BE A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE
         WITH SOMEBODY
     COMING INTO THE HOUSE.
           - MARIELY?

       SHE'D BE RELIEVED
         FOR THE HELP.
    - I CLEAN ALL THE TIME.
        YOU NEVER CLEAN.
          I'M THE ONE
    THAT'S ALWAYS CLEANING,

     SO I WOULD BE RELIEVED
       TO HAVE YOU THERE.
       - ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
        - WE'LL DO THIS.
       WE STILL GOT TIME.

           ALL RIGHT,
    NEXT QUESTION, COUPLES.
      GENTLEMEN, PHOTOSHOP
    ALTERS CELEBRITY PHOTOS
      BEFORE THEY MAKE IT
      INTO THE MAGAZINES.

           SO, GUYS,
        BEFORE YOUR WIFE
         WOULD GIVE YOU
    A NUDE PHOTO OF HERSELF,
     WHAT PART OF HER BODY
DID SHE SAY SHE WOULD PHOTOSHOP?

             KYLE?
           - [sighs]
         I'M GONNA GET
      IN TROUBLE FOR THIS,

        BUT I KNOW SHE'S
 VERY SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT,
   SO I'M GONNA SAY HER HIPS.
          - HER HIPS?
             - YES.

        - OKAY, THAT'S--
     NIKKI, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       SHE SAID HER BUTT.
     - IT'S THE SAME THING.

          SHE TELLS ME
      IT'S THE SAME THING.
    - WELL, I MEAN, IT CAN--
   IT'S THAT PART BACK THERE,
   AS OPPOSED TO ON THE SIDE.

    - I DON'T KNOW--SHE SAYS
 SHE COMBINES IT ALL TOGETHER.
      IT'S THE SAME THING.
         - YOU'RE LIKE,
     THE WHOLE AREA, LOOK.

             OKAY,
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, PATRICK?
        - I WOULD S--UH!
      I WOULD PROBABLY SAY
           HER BOOBS?

             - WHY?
   - WELL, I THINK SHE TALKED
ABOUT GETTING THEM DONE BIGGER,
   BUT I THINK THEY'RE GREAT.

    - SHE SAID HER BREASTS.
 GIRL, YOU'RE LIKE, "MY BOOBS."
     - I'M BACK! I'M BACK!
        - YOU ARE BACK.
            [laughs]

           [applause]
        GIRL, YOU SAID,
  "LET ME HOLD UP THIS ANSWER
  BEFORE I GO AWAY SOMEWHERE."
             - YES!

        - OKAY, AND WHAT
      WOULD YOU SAY, RYAN?
          - UH, WELL,
        I LIKE HER BUTT,
        BUT I THINK THAT
SHE ALWAYS THINKS IT'S TOO BIG,

      AND SO I'M GONNA SAY
    THAT SHE SAID HER BUTT.
   - SHE WOULD SAY HER BUTT.
            - YEAH.
            - BECCA,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

          HER THIGHS.
           - OHH, NO!
         YOU NEVER SAY
    YOUR THIGHS ARE TOO BIG.
  YOU SAY YOUR BUTT'S TOO BIG.
       - BUT I THINK IT.

            - WELL,
     HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT?
         - OH, DRAT IT.
    IT'S THE AGE-OLD THING.
         HE SHOULD KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. ALL RIGHT.

    WELL, COUPLE NUMBER ONE
    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
       YOU GUYS ARE TIED
        FOR FIRST PLACE.
       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
      YOU HAVE TEN POINTS,

       TO TURN IT AROUND.
    KEEP IT HERE. OUR FINAL
  BONUS QUESTION IS COMING UP,

 - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY WILD.

            - YEAH?
          ANY REASON,
       PARTICULAR REASON?
       - I JUST FEEL LIKE
    THAT WOULD BE THE ANSWER

         SHE WOULD SAY.
   - AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
    - I JUST LIKE THE SOUND
          OF <i>CALIENTE.</i>

            - YEAH?
  - I LIKE THE SOUND OF THAT.
           BUT FOR--
       I WANNA SAY WILD.
     - HUH, OKAY, BUT WILD.
           WE GOT IT.

             BRYAN?
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
           WILD, TOO.
 I DON'T THINK SHE COULD HANDLE
          THE <i>CALIENTE.</i>

       - YOU DON'T THINK
     SHE COULDHANDLE--WHAT?
       - I MEAN, I GOT IT
       IN MY REPERTOIRE,
    BUT I CAN'T, YOU KNOW--
           - REALLY?

      WELL, CAN YOU HANDLE
          THE <i>CALIENTE?</i>
  I WONDER IF SHE MIGHT SAY--
   - IT'S A BETTER QUESTION.
       - OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

      JIM, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - I'D HAVE TO GO
         WITH <i>CALIENTE.</i>
             - AH.

   - UH, WE LIKE SPICY FOOD,
          AND I--WELL,
   I LIKE OTHER THINGS SPICY.
          - ALL RIGHT.

   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE:
   FORGET <i>AMERICA'S TOP MODEL.</i>

 BECAUSE WHILE SHE'S BEAUTIFUL,
        MY WIFE WOULD BE
     EVEN MORE OF A SHOO-IN
    TO WIN THE REALITY SHOW

  CALLED <i>AMERICA'S TOP</i> "BLANK".
             BRYAN?
   - UH, MAYBE <i>AMERICA'S TOP,</i>
             <i>UM...</i>

           <i>SHOE BUYER?</i>
   - <i>AMERICA'S TOP SHOE BUYER?</i>
            <i>- SURE.</i>
     - ABOUT HOW MANY PAIRS
     DO YOU THINK SHE HAS?

          - HUNDREDS.
        MAYBE THOUSANDS.
           - REALLY?
            OH, WOW.
        YOU JUST--WHOA.
             OKAY.

      JIM, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - OH, THIS IS A NO-BRAINER.
    IT'S DEFINITELY SHOPPER.

    -  <i>AMERICA'S TOP SHOPPER?</i>
           <i>-</i> ABSOLUTELY.
          - OKAY, JOE?
     - I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
         TO SAY WORKER.

       SHE WORKS SO HARD.
     - <i>AMERICA'S TOP WORKER.</i>
   ALL RIGHT, FINAL QUESTION.

           GENTLEMEN,
   WHAT WOULD YOUR WIFE CLAIM
  IS THE BIGGEST BEDROOM SNAFU
      YOU HAVE EVER MADE?
              JIM?

        - WEARING SOCKS,
        AND ONLY SOCKS.
     SHE DOESN'T LIKE THAT.
- I DON'T KNOW, I'M JUST TRYING
       TO PICTURE SOCKS.

    - I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
        TO PICTURE THAT.
   - IT'S ALREADY IN MY HEAD.
        THERE'S NOTHING
      YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT.

     IT'S RIGHT IN MY HEAD,
           ALL RIGHT?
     WHAT DO YOU SAY, JOE?
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
     PLAYING WITH HER FEET.

        SHE HATES FEET.
    - YOU PLAY WITH HER FEET
         OR YOUR FEET?
          - HER FEET.

   - AND SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT
         WHEN YOU PLAY
         WITH HER FEET?
   - SHE DOES NOT LIKE FEET.

       I GAVE IT A SHOT,
           YOU KNOW.
   LIKE, I FIGURED, YOU KNOW,
       LONG DAY AT WORK,
       SHE'D WANT, LIKE,
        A FOOT MASSAGE.

            - OKAY.
        - AND YOU KNOW,
     SHE JUST DOESN'T LIKE
     THE WHOLE FOOT THING,
           YOU KNOW.

        - OKAY, SO IT IS
         A FOOT THING.
           ALL RIGHT.
     BRYAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - UH, I'D SAY IT'S PROBABLY
       MY PILLOW HABITS.
        - WHAT ARE YOUR
         PILLOW HABITS?
     - I TEND TO JUST SLEEP
     WITH A TON OF PILLOWS.

            - OKAY.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
           THANK YOU.
           NICE JOB.
      WHILE WE'RE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,

       GARY, YOU HAVE GOT
           TO TELL US
  ABOUT THAT SECOND HONEYMOON
   THAT THEY'RE PLAYING FOR.

 - TONIGHT'S WINNING NEWLYWEDS
     ARE GOING TO CELEBRATE
     THEIR SECOND HONEYMOON
      AT BREEZES BAHAMAS.

    ON NASSAU'S WORLD FAMOUS
          CABLE BEACH,
   THE SUPER-INCLUSIVE RESORT
      OFFERS AN ABUNDANCE
   OF WATER AND LAND SPORTS,

         INCLUDING FIVE
       FRESHWATER POOLS,
        FLYING TRAPEZE,
         AND A 30-FOOT
      ROCK CLIMBING WALL.

 WITH FIVE RESTAURANTS AND BARS
        TO CHOOSE FROM,
  GUESTS AT BREEZES WILL ENJOY
        A WIDE SELECTION
       OF DINING OPTIONS.

     - THAT SOUNDS SO GOOD.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS.

     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     EARNS YOU FIVE POINTS.
         SO HERE WE GO.

    LADIES, IF YOUR SEX LIFE
       WERE A SALSA BAR,
          WHAT FLAVOR
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
   WOULD BE THE MOST POPULAR
           WITH YOU?

             MILD,
             WILD,
          OR <i>CALIENTE?</i>
              KAY?

           - <i>CALIENTE.</i>
           <i>- CALIENTE?</i>
       AND WHY DO YOU SAY
            <i>CALIENTE?</i>
 - 'CAUSE JOE LIKES THINGS HOT.

     - HE LIKES STUFF HOT?
          - OKAY, JOE,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         - I SAID WILD.

        - HE SAID WILD.
       [audience groans]
           ALL RIGHT,
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, ALLYSON?

  - I-I HOPE HE SAID <i>CALIENTE.</i>
       I LIKE IT <i>CALIENTE.</i>
          - ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

         DID YOU SAY--
      YOU JUST SAID WILD.
    - I WENT WITH WILD, TOO.
             - WHY?

          - I TOLD YOU
      IT WAS PROBABLY YOU
      WHO COULDN'T HANDLE
          THE <i>CALIENTE.</i>
     - YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
   - THAT'S WHAT I SAID, SEE?

       - I APPRECIATE IT.
        - GIRL, YOU KNOW
         I'M WIT' YOU.
     KOMEL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - WELL, I'M GONNA SAY <i>CALIENTE</i>
       AND HOPE WE'RE NOT
            0 FOR 3.
     AT LEAST, I THINK SO.

  - WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY?
            <i>CALIENTE.</i>
             <i>YEAH.</i>
    - THAT'S THE SAME REASON
            I GAVE.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
   FORGET <i>AMERICA'S TOP MODEL.</i>

     BECAUSE WHILE MY WIFE
         IS BEAUTIFUL,
     SHE WOULD EVEN BE MORE
          OF A SHOO-IN
    TO WIN THE REALITY SHOW

  CALLED <i>AMERICA'S TOP</i> "BLANK".
            ALLYSON?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
    <i>AMERICA'S NEXT TOP DANCER</i>

    BECAUSE I LOVE TO DANCE
         ALL THE TIME.
      - YOU LOVE TO DANCE?
           ALL RIGHT,
    WHAT'D YOUR HUSBAND SAY?

    <i>AMERICA'S TOP SHOE BUYER.</i>
             - OH!
      - WELL, ENOUGH SHOES
    TO GO DANCING WITH, HUH?

           ALL RIGHT,
   WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, KOMEL?
   - UM, I WOULD SAY SHOPPER.
           - SHOPPER?
         - I THINK SO.

    - OKAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      <i>AMERICA'S TOP SHOPPER.</i>
     AND IT'S ON YOU, KAY.

     - I THINK I'M GONNA GO
     WITH THE SHOPPER, TOO.
    - JOE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - I SAID THAT SHE WORKS
             A LOT.

     - <i>AMERICA'S TOP WORKER.</i>
       - WHO WANTS  BE
    ON   <i>AMERICA'S TOP WORKER?</i>
        - I KNOW, IT'S--

     IT'S NOT REALLY SEXY,
             IS IT?
           ALL RIGHT,
         WE'RE GONNA GO
 TO THE FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.

      WHAT WOULD YOU CLAIM
  IS THE BIGGEST BEDROOM SNAFU
  YOUR HUSBAND HAS EVER MADE?
             KOMEL?

    - I THOUGHT I CAUGHT HIM
     WATCHING TV ONE TIME.
        - WHILE YOU GUYS
     WERE GETTIN' <i>CALIENTE?</i>
        - I KNOW, YEAH.

          [Jim groans]
      - WHAT DID YOU THINK
        HE WAS WATCHING?
   - UM, I THINK IT WAS ESPN.
             - <i>WHAT?</i>

            - YEAH.
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      WEARING ONLY SOCKS.

   ARE THEY THE SHORT SOCKS?
          LONG SOCKS?
      - UM, THEY'RE WHITE
        ATHLETIC SOCKS.
    - WHITE ATHLETIC SOCKS,
         WATCHING ESPN

   WHILE YOU GETTIN' <i>CALIENTE.</i>
   THAT DON'T MAKE NO SENSE.
         OKAY, AND KAY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - I'M GONNA SAY--
     THIS IS REALLY GROSS.
           HE FARTS.

     [laughter and groans]
   - YOU HAVE JUST DESTROYED
           MY FANTASY
       OF ASHTON KUTCHER.

        I SWEAR TO GOD.
             - YES.
              YES.

             - J--
           [laughing]
    JOE, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     PLAYING WITH HER FEET.

    - SHE DOESN'T LIKE FEET.
        - IS THAT TRUE?
         - IT IS TRUE.
          IT'S WEIRD.

    HE WANTS TO USE MY FOOT,
     LIKE, AS A PLAY PHONE.
       AND I DON'T EVEN--
       I DON'T EVEN KNOW!

     - HE DID NOT SAY THAT!
   JOE, YOU WERE HOLDING OUT
             ON US.
        HE SAID HE TRIES
         TO MASSAGE IT,

     AND YOU DON'T LIKE IT.
 - I'VE NEVER GOTTEN A MASSAGE.
    - SHE'S JUST THROWING ME
         UNDER THE BUS.

          - I'M SORRY.
         - JOE, WHAT--
           [laughing]
         OH, IT'S TRUE.
             OKAY.

            ALLYSON.
        - I'M ACTUALLY--
      I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS
        WOULD GET ALONG,
'CAUSE I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA SAY

         FARTING, TOO,
        IN THE BEDROOM.
    - YOU GUYS ARE THE MOST
        ROMANTIC COUPLES
        I HAVE EVER MET.

  WHAT DID--WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      - I THOUGHT YOU HAD
         THIS ONE, TOO.
  - HE SAID HIS PILLOW HABIT.

             - OH.
          - YEAH, SEE?
           SHE KNOWS.
       - WHAT DOES HE DO
       WITH THE PILLOWS?

    - HE DOESN'T USE PILLOWS
          TO SLEEP ON,
      LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE.
     HE LIKES TO HUG THEM.

    - BRYAN, YOU STILL DOING
        THE MAMA THING?
 YOU COULD LET THE PILLOWS GO.
        OH, MY GOODNESS.
           I LOVE IT.

   YOU GUYS ARE SO WONDERFUL.
     YOU'RE PUTTIN' A SMILE
          ON MY FACE.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       IT IS TIME FOR YOU
   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
   THESE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS

   ARE WORTH 10 POINTS EACH.
        IF YOUR HUSBAND
        OWNED A BUILDING
   AND EACH FLOOR REPRESENTED
     A PAST SEXUAL LIAISON,

   WOULD HE HAVE A TOWNHOUSE,
     AN APARTMENT COMPLEX,
   OR THE CHRYSLER BUILDING?

              KAY?
     - I'M GONNA GO WITH...
       APARTMENT COMPLEX.

    - AN APARTMENT COMPLEX?
            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.
            ALLYSON?
         - I'M GONNA GO

         I THINK HE'S,
           YOU KNOW,
     HE'S--HE'S BEEN THERE,
         HE'S DONE IT.
            - YEAH.

     - BUT NOT TO THE POINT
     WHERE I WOULDN'T HAVE
          MARRIED HIM.
- OKAY, SO AN APARTMENT COMPLEX.

      APARTMENT BUILDING.
           ALL RIGHT,
   AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, KOMEL?
    - I'M ACTUALLY GONNA GO
        WITH TOWNHOUSE.

 - HE STILL HAS A COUPLE FLOORS
       YOU CAN WORK WITH.
 - COUPLE FLOORS, NOT TOO MANY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
         OKAY, LADIES,
  WHAT WAS YOUR HUSBAND DOING

   THE LAST TIME YOU SAW HIM
         BREAK A SWEAT?
            ALLYSON?
   - PROBABLY GETTING NERVOUS
         FOR THIS SHOW,

         TO BE HONEST.
           - REALLY?
        WAS HE SWEATING?
   - YEAH, HE WAS DEFINITELY
       SWEATING ABOUT IT.

   - HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB.
  NOTHING TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT.
       ALL RIGHT, KOMEL?

      - DEFINITELY COOKING
        IN THE KITCHEN.
     - OKAY, SO THAT'S WHEN
       HE BREAKS A SWEAT?
        - YEAH, MM-HMM.
       - ALL RIGHT, KAY?

        - I'M GONNA SAY
       HE WAS DOING, UM,
        LIKE, YARD WORK.
     I CAME HOME YESTERDAY,

       AND HE HAD, LIKE,
           A CHAINSAW
   AND WAS GOING AT THE TREE
          BY THE POOL.
      - HE HAD A CHAINSAW?

     - YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
       - AND HE WAS GOING
           AT A TREE?
  - AND WE HAD OUR FRIEND OVER
          WITH AN AX.

      LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.
      - OKAY, THAT'S SCARY
          RIGHT THERE.
 THAT'S--THAT DON'T EVEN SOUND
        LIKE YARD WORK.

THAT SOUND LIKE THEY WAS TRYING
       TO HIDE SOMETHING.
          A CHAINSAW?
          - AND AN AX.

       - YOU BETTER CHECK
          YO' MAN OUT,
        'CAUSE HE PLAYS
         WITH YOUR FOOT
   AND MAKES IT A CELL PHONE.

     THAT'S SOMETHING WEIRD
    ABOUT ALL OF THAT, GIRL.
             OKAY.
         NOW A QUESTION
       FROM THENEST.COM,

   THE FIRST NAME IN WEBSITES
         FOR NEWLYWEDS.
    WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING
        YOUR HUSBAND DID
         THAT SIGNALED
  YOUR RELATIONSHIP WAS MOVING

       TO THE NEXT LEVEL?
             KOMEL?
      - UM, I'M GONNA SAY
        HE BOUGHT ME...

      JEWELRY ON HIS TRIP
           TO CHINA.
           - GOTCHA.
              KAY?
        - THIS IS WEIRD,
     BUT I'M GONNA SAY HE--

     - NO, IT IS NOT WEIRD.
    'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW HOW
       YOU ARE GONNA TOP
 A CHAINSAW AND CELLULAR PHONE
          FOOT FETISH.

   SO THERE'S NOTHING WEIRD,
             GIRL.
      - I'M JUST GONNA SAY
     THAT HE--HE CALLED ME.
      BECAUSE WE HAD A LOT
 OF, LIKE, PHONE CONVERSATIONS

    THAT WENT BACK AND FORTH
        WHERE HE, LIKE,
         COULDN'T TALK,
     AND IT WAS LIKE HE WAS
        BLOWING ME OFF.

  - WELL, MAYBE 'CAUSE HE WAS
        ON A FOOT PHONE.
     HE COULDN'T TALK LONG,
             MAYBE.
            - MAYBE.

        - OKAY, ALLYSON?
 - I WOULD SAY WHEN HE TOOK ME
         ON A REAL DATE
          FOR DINNER.

   BECAUSE WE MET IN COLLEGE.
         SO, YOU KNOW,
   COLLEGE YOU'RE, YOU KNOW,
     NUH-NUH-NUH, YOU KNOW,
     YOU'RE NOT GOING OUT.

            - RIGHT.
 - SO WHEN HE ACTUALLY ASKED ME
        ON A REAL DATE,
      IS WHEN I FEEL LIKE
  I WAS LIKE, "OH, HM, OKAY."

          - TERRIFIC.
           ALL RIGHT.

    IS SIT ON HIS COMPUTER.
 - OKAY, SITS ON THE COMPUTER.
            ALLYSON?

       - UM, I WOULD SAY
MY FAVORITE THING TO DO TO RELAX
         IS TO WATCH TV
       IN THE LIVING ROOM
       WITH ALL MY SHOWS,

  WHILE HE--HIS FAVORITE THING
         TO DO TO RELAX
        IS ALSO TO WATCH
        HIS    <i>SURVIV</i>SHOWS
        IN THE BEDROOM.

      SO WE LITERALLY JUST
       COME HOME SEPARATE
 AND WATCH--WE WATCH OUR SHOWS.
   - SO YOU WATCH YOUR SHOWS
      IN THE LIVING ROOM.

      HE'S IN THE BEDROOM
      WATCHING HIS SHOWS.
          - YEP, YEP.
         - OKAY, KOMEL?

     - I WOULD SAY, FOR ME,
     DEFINITELY WATCHING TV
     WITH A GLASS OF WINE.
       AND, UM, FOR HIM,
         IT'S COOKING.

  HE REALLY ACTUALLY LOVES IT,
      AND SO HE DOES THAT
         WHILE I RELAX.
       - OOH, I LOVE IT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.

       THANK YOU SO MUCH.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
        WE ARE GONNA SEE

 I have two car insurances in
       front of you here.
        Let's start with
        car insurance X.
  Four million people switched

     to that car insurance
     alone just last year.
              Mmm,
    it's got a nice bouquet.

  Our second car insurance, Y.
             Mmmmm,
   Oh, I can see by your face

they just lost another customer.
     You chose GEICO over
        the competitor.
     Calm down, calm down.

  You're getting carried away.
D
       AND NOW YOUR HOST,
        SHERRI SHEPHERD.

     AND COUPLE NUMBER TWO,

    IF YOU OWNED A BUILDING
   AND EACH FLOOR REPRESENTED
     A PAST SEXUAL LIAISON,
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
  YOU WOULD HAVE A TOWNHOUSE,

     AN APARTMENT COMPLEX,
   OR THE CHRYSLER BUILDING?
              JOE?

    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
       CHRYSLER BUILDING.
             - OH.

     - UH, WELL, JUST--I--
         I THINK THAT'S
       THE RIGHT ANSWER.
          - TOWNHOUSE.

   IS THAT THE RIGHT ANSWER,
             KOMEL?
    - YES, I SAID TOWNHOUSE.
         - A TOWNHOUSE!
             OKAY.

 GENTLEMEN, WHAT DID YOUR WIFE
       SAY YOU WERE DOING

         BREAK A SWEAT?
             BRYAN?

            - UH...
  THAT'S PROBABLY PRETTY EASY.
     I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
       WHEN SHE ASKED ME

      TO BE ON THIS SHOW.
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.
 - WHAT WERE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT,
      COMING ON THIS SHOW?

    - WELL, I'VE NEVER BEEN
   IN FRONT OF A TV AUDIENCE.
    YOU KNOW, IT'S A LITTLE
        NERVE-WRACKING.
- TALKING ABOUT WHERE YOU DO IT
    AND HOW OFTEN YOU DO IT.

           - EXACTLY.
    - ARE YOU SWEATING NOW,
        OR ARE YOU OKAY?
     - NO, I'M PRETTY GOOD.

          - ALL RIGHT,
     WHAT'D YOUR WIFE SAY?
    - I SAID GETTING NERVOUS
         FOR THE SHOW.

            - NICE.
  - OKAY, WHAT ABOUT YOU, JIM?

     - UH, I'D HAVE TO SAY
      PLAYING BASKETBALL.
     - PLAYING BASKETBALL?
   - JUST PLAYING BASKETBALL
         THIS WEEKEND.

           I CAME IN.
          SHE SAID I--
    I WAS STINKY AND SWEATY.
      - AS YOU SHOULD BE.
       ALL RIGHT, KOMEL.

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I SAID COOKING.
             - AW.

       - HE--HE'S RIGHT.
      BUT YOU ALWAYS COOK.
   - THAT WAS THE LAST THING.
     - BUT YOU ALWAYS COOK.

  - NO, IT WAS THE LAST THING.
          - ALL RIGHT.
      JOE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
        SPLITTING WOOD.

     'CAUSE I WAS SPLITTING
         WOOD YESTERDAY
        IN THE BACKYARD.
    - YOU SPLIT WOOD A LOT?

     - YEAH, I LOST A TREE.
     I LOST--I LOST A TREE.
      SO I'M CUTTING IT UP
    FOR FIREWOOD, BASICALLY.

        JUST WITH AN AX.
       - OH, YOU TALKING
    ABOUT CUTTING UP A TR--
OH, I THOUGHT YOU MEANT SPLIT--

 OH, I THOUGHT YOU WAS TALKING
        ABOUT DOING IT.
  IT'S LIKE, WHEN YOU USE FEET
        AS A CELL PHONE.
     I THOUGHT IT WAS CODE.

        OH, MY GOODNESS.
           ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT DID YOU SAY, KAY?
      - I SAID YARD WORK.

 - YARD WORK, JUDGES, THAT'S--
       - DOES THAT WORK?
             - YES!
          - ALL RIGHT!
           ALL RIGHT.

        - NOW A QUESTION
       FROM THENEST.COM,
   THE FIRST NAME IN WEBSITES
         FOR NEWLYWEDS.
     WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY
  WAS THE FIRST THING YOU DID

         THAT SIGNALED
       YOUR RELATIONSHIP
           WAS MOVING
       TO THE NEXT LEVEL?
              JIM?

        - I'LL SAY, UH,
          WHEN I, UH,
          MET HER AT--
          WE WENT OUT,
      AND I DROVE HER HOME
  AFTER THE--AFTER GOING OUT,

        I TOOK HER HOME.
      - ALL RIGHT, KOMEL,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     - I SAID WHEN HE WENT
            TO CHINA

    AND BROUGHT ME JEWELRY.
    - DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
      - NO--UH, OH, YEAH.
         WELL, THAT WAS
       A GOOD ONE, YEAH.

       - ALL RIGHT, JOE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
          HAS IT GONE
       TO THE NEXT LEVEL?
   [Joe laughs sarcastically]

        - YOU KNOW WHAT?
        JOE, I REALLY--
      I NEED TO BE CAREFUL
          AROUND YOU,

  'CAUSE YOU GOT A LOTTA AXES.
        SO I REALLY NEED
       TO WATCH THE JOKES
    THAT I MAKE AROUND YOU.

     - UM, I'D HAVE TO SAY
       COME TO VISIT HER
     WHEN SHE WAS FAR AWAY.
     WE HAD A LONG-DISTANCE
   RELATIONSHIP FOR A WHILE.

          - OKAY, KAY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
     - I SAID HE CALLED ME.

       - SHE SAID YOU C--
           [laughter]
     AND YOU MAKE THAT FACE
             AT ME!

    WHAT ARE YOU GONNA MAKE
      THE FACE AT ME FOR?
           ALL RIGHT.
     BRYAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - UM, I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY
           WHEN I HAD
 A LITTLE CONVERSATION WITH HER
        ABOUT MY--MY GAS
      WHEN SHE WAS MOVING
          IN WITH ME.

             YEAH.
     - SO THAT'S SOMETHING
       THAT YOU NORMALLY
       DIDN'T TALK ABOUT

      WITH ANY OTHER WOMEN
          WHEN YOU HAD
    YOUR APARTMENT COMPLEX.
       THEY DIDN'T KNOW.

      - NOT ONLY DID I NOT
         TALK ABOUT IT.
      SHE JUST DIDN'T KNOW
        ABOUT IT AT ALL.
        - OKAY, ALLYSON,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

      - UM, I MEAN, I SAID
    TOOK ME ON A REAL DATE.
       I THOUGHT THAT WAS
        THE FIRST LEVEL.
         - GIRL, YEAH,
    WHEN A MAN PREWARNS YOU

         HE'S GOT GAS,
    THAT'S NEXT-LEVEL STUFF.
             - SEE?
       - YEAH, SILLY ME.
          - ALL RIGHT.
