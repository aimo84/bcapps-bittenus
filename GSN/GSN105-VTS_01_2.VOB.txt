           YOU READY?
          HERE WE GO.
    GENTLEMEN, WHAT KITCHEN
     UTENSIL BEST DESCRIBES

   THE SCENE IN YOUR BEDROOM
          LAST NIGHT?
       YOU AND THE MISSES
         WERE SPOONING,
    THERE WAS SOME GOOD OLD
       FORKING GOING ON,

        OR YOU COULD CUT
   THE TENSION WITH A KNIFE?
             CADE?
     - DEFINITELY SPOONING.
      DEFINITELY SPOONING.

    WE WERE A LITTLE NERVOUS
        BEFORE THE SHOW.
    - YOU A LITTLE NERVOUS?
 - YEAH, COULDN'T SLEEP AT ALL.
   BUT--BUT, YEAH, YOU KNOW.
 - AND SPOONING CALMS YOU DOWN?

         - ABSOLUTELY.
          - I LOVE IT.
             DANTE?
       - LITTLE SPOONING,
     AND I WAS OUT RIGHT--

        WHENEVER MY HEAD
     HITS THE PILLOW, DONE.
      I'M OUT RIGHT AWAY.
      - IS IT THE SPOONING
        THAT DOES THAT?

    - IT DOES IT RIGHT AWAY.
            - OKAY.
     ALL RIGHT, WHAT WOULD
        YOU SAY, BRIAN?

         - I'M GONNA GO
     WITH SPOONING AS WELL,
     BUT IT'S A LITTLE BIT
     OF ACCIDENTAL SPOONING
   'CAUSE WE HAVE A SMALL BED
       AND HALF THE TIME

    WE'RE KINDA JUST FALLING
     ON TOP OF EACH OTHER.
   SO IT'S NICE, BUT IT'S NOT
  ALWAYS INTENTIONAL SPOONING.
   - OKAY, BUT IT FEELS GOOD
  WHEN WE YOU GET THERE, HUH?

       - IT'S GOOD, YEAH.
        YOU DON'T MIND.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

    NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
         I EXPLAIN IT,
          MY WIFE JUST
       DOESN'T GET BLANK.
             DANTE?

  - MY WIFE JUST DOESN'T GET--
            GET IT.
           [laughter]
   - SHE JUST DOESN'T GET IT.

      IS THAT OKAY, JUDGE?
     YES, WE CAN TAKE THAT.
    SHE JUST DOESN'T GET IT.
     - JUST THE FIRST THING
 THAT POPPED IN MY HEAD, YEAH.

     - SO SHE JUST DOESN'T
            GET IT.
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   BRIAN, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

     - I WOULD SAY MY WIFE
    JUST DOESN'T GET MY JOB.
         - WHAT IS IT?
        WHAT DO YOU DO?

   - I'M A COMPUTER AUDITOR.
     - YOU AUDIT COMPUTERS?
      - YEAH, IT'S THE FUN
          OF COMPUTERS

 AND THE EXCITEMENT OF AUDITING
          ALL IN ONE.
    BUT--NO, I LOVE MY JOB,
         BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT GLAMOROUS OR EXCITING.

 AND SHE'LL ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE,
        "WELL, HE WORKS
      FOR THE GOVERNMENT.
       HE DOES SOMETHING
        WITH AUDITING."

  SO I DON'T THINK SHE'LL EVER
       UNDERSTAND MY JOB.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     CADE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I WORK FOR A PROMOTIONS
   COMPANY AND MANUFACTURER.

       - OKAY, SO YOU'RE
          ALWAYS BUSY.
  - YEAH, AND I'M ON THE ROAD
             A LOT.
    SO SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT,

 BUT SHE DEFINITELY DOESN'T GET
        HOW MUCH I WORK.
            - OKAY.
         NEXT QUESTION.
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION,
           GENTLEMEN.

      LET'S SAY YOUR LADY
      IS IN A NAKED LINEUP
     WITH TEN OTHER WOMEN.
    IF YOU WERE BLINDFOLDED

        AND ONLY ALLOWED
        TO IDENTIFY HER
      BY FEELING ONE SPOT,
     WHAT PART OF HER BODY
        WOULD YOU TOUCH?

             BRIAN?
   - I WOULD TOUCH HER NOSE,
       WHICH IS PROBABLY
    A LITTLE BIT OF A CHEAT.

     SHE'S GOT A NOSE RING,
     AND I WOULD JUST KNOW
   PROBABLY WHERE THE HOLE IS
          RIGHT THERE.
 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS
       THAT ATTRACTED ME.

    SHE HAD A BEAUTIFUL FACE
        WHEN I MET HER,
         AND I THOUGHT
     THE NOSE RING WAS CUTE
AND FELL IN LOVE WITH HER THEN.

  - SO YOU WOULD KNOW TO FEEL
      FOR THAT NOSE RING.
    - JUST TAP RIGHT THERE.
    - ALL RIGHT, WHAT WOULD
         YOU SAY, CADE?

   - DEFINITELY HER NIPPLES.
         - HER NIPPLES.
         - HANDS DOWN.
        - CAN I ASK WHAT
  HER NIPPLES WOULD FEEL LIKE

    VERSUS NINE OTHER WOMEN?
        - I DON'T THINK
      I COULD ANSWER THAT
       AND WALK AWAY FROM
    THIS SHOW STILL MARRIED.

           [laughter]
  - BUT YOU WOULD KNOW FROM--
   - ABSOLUTELY, HANDS DOWN.
  - FROM TOUCHING HER NIPPLES
          THAT THAT--

     I DON'T EVEN THINK I'M
   SUPPOSED TO BE DOING THAT.
             YOU--
           [laughter]
         WHAT IS THAT?
  - WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

 - SO THAT'S WHY YOU KEEP YOUR
  HANDS IN YOUR LAP LIKE THIS.
     SO YOU WOULD KNOW FROM
 TOUCHING YOUR WIFE'S NIPPLES?
         - ABSOLUTELY.
   - THAT THAT WOULD BE HER?

          OKAY, DANTE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - SHE'S GOT A GREAT STOMACH,
        AND SHE KNOWS--
    I JUST KNOW THAT'S WHAT
     I WOULD GO RIGHT FOR.

        - OKAY, GOT IT.
  THANK YOU VERY MUCH, FELLAS.
           NICE JOB.
      WHILE WE'RE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,

   GARY, PLEASE TELL US ABOUT
     THAT SECOND HONEYMOON
      THEY'RE PLAYING FOR.

     INCLUDING A KOHALA SPA
        COUPLES MASSAGE
      AND A CATAMARAN SAIL
        INTO THE SUNSET.

    - ALL RIGHT, THAT SOUNDS
       REALLY GOOD TO ME.
            LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,

     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     EARNS YOU FIVE POINTS,
         SO HERE WE GO.

            LADIES,
      WHAT KITCHEN UTENSIL
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
    BEST DESCRIBES THE SCENE
  IN YOUR BEDROOM LAST NIGHT:

   YOU AND HE WERE SPOONING,
    THERE WAS SOME GOOD OLD
       FORKING GOING ON,
  OR YOU COULD CUT THE TENSION
         WITH A KNIFE?

            KELSEY?
         - I'M GONNA GO
       WITH THE SPOONING.
   - WITH THE SPOONING, YEAH?
              WHY?

   - 'CAUSE WE LIKE TO SPOON.
  - 'CAUSE YOU LIKE TO SPOON?
         - IT'S SWEET.
          - ALL RIGHT,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

           SPOONING!
         - YEAH, BABE.
         - YEAH, CADE.

     [cheers and applause]
     WHAT ABOUT YOU, STACY?
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
         SPOONING ALSO.

            - YEAH?
    - LONG WEEK, LONG NIGHT.
   NEEDED TO GET SOME SLEEP.
     NO FORKING LAST NIGHT.

          - [laughing]
         SO SPOONING IS
     LIKE YOUR NYQUIL, HUH?
             - YES.
          - ALL RIGHT.

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
         SPOONING! YES.
     [cheers and applause]
           ALL RIGHT.

            CRYSTOL?
        - UM, I'M GONNA
         SAY SPOONING.
       WE HAD A LONG DAY,

   AND WE WERE GETTING READY
           FOR TODAY,
    SO WE REALLY RESTED UP.
         - SO SPOONING.
     BRIAN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

           SPOONING!
     [cheers and applause]
     THAT SPOONING WORKED.

     YOU GUYS ARE ALL ZEN.
       YOU'RE VERY CALM.
      OKAY, NEXT QUESTION.
  LADIES, HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

    NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
         I EXPLAIN IT,
            MY WIFE
    JUST DOESN'T GET BLANK.
             STACY?

             - IT?
           [laughter]
  - WHY--WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

    - JUST, I'M THE CONTROL
         IN THE FAMILY,
     SO USUALLY, YOU KNOW,
    I'M SPITTING OUT ORDERS,
      SPITTING OUT THINGS,

      AND WHEN HE TELLS ME
           SOMETHING,
   I'M JUST LIKE, "WHATEVER."
         I DON'T KNOW.
    I'M GONNA GO WITH "IT."

    - DANTE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
             "IT!"
     [cheers and applause]

      THIS IS WHAT I LOVE
       ABOUT BOTH OF YOU.
 YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO THINK.
        YOU WENT, "IT."
            - YEAH.

   - IT SOUNDS LIKE IT CAME--
     THAT THIS IS SOMETHING
  THAT COMES OUT OF YOUR MOUTH
       QUITE FREQUENTLY.

    CRYSTOL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - UM, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS
          I DON'T GET,
      BUT I THINK PROBABLY
      PROGRAMMING THE DVR.

    I'M NEVER GOOD AT THAT,
        AND BRIAN ALWAYS
        HAS TO DO THAT.
          - ALL RIGHT,
    BRIAN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - I SAID MY JOB.
           - HIS JOB.
          - OH, YEAH,
       THAT'S TRUE, TOO.
   I NEVER REALLY UNDERSTAND
         WHAT HE DOES.

  - CRYSTOL, WHAT DOES HE DO?
   - HE WORKS WITH COMPUTERS
          IN AUDITING,
    BUT I REALLY DON'T KNOW
     WHAT THAT MEANS, SO...

            - OKAY.
    KELSEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - UH, NOT TO COPY,
    BUT I GOTTA SAY HIS JOB.
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, CADE?

       HOW MUCH HE WORKS.
             YEAH.
     [cheers and applause]
       YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!

      - YOU'RE DOING GOOD.
      I'M GONNA KEEP YOU.
    - YOU'RE GONNA KEEP ME?
              YES.

      - ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, COUPLES.
       LADIES, LET'S SAY
   YOU'RE IN A NAKED LINE-UP
     WITH TEN OTHER WOMEN.

        IF YOUR HUSBAND
        WAS BLINDFOLDED
AND ONLY ALLOWED TO IDENTIFY YOU
      BY FEELING ONE SPOT,
     WHAT PART OF YOUR BODY
   DID HE SAY HE WOULD TOUCH?

            CRYSTOL?
      - MY MOUTH, I GUESS.
         - YOUR MOUTH?
            - YEAH.
  - HE WOULD FEEL YOUR MOUTH?

           ALL RIGHT,
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, BRIAN?
           YOUR NOSE.
             - OHH!
   - 'CAUSE OF THE NOSE RING,

     AND IT'S ON YOUR FACE.
        - OH, ALL RIGHT.
            - OKAY.
    KELSEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - I'D HAVE TO SAY
          MY REAR END.
        - YOUR REAR END.
           - I WOULD.
      - IS THAT SOMETHING
     HE FEELS QUITE OFTEN?

            - IT IS,
       AND HE SEEMS TO BE
        QUITE A BIG FAN
             OF IT.
             - OHH!

        ALL RIGHT, CADE,
    LET'S SEE WHAT YOU SAID.
     - IT WAS SECOND BEST.
        - YOUR NIPPLES.

             - OH!

        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.

   HERE'S OUR FIRST QUESTION.
      LADIES, IF YOU WERE
         TO THROW AWAY
             ALL OF
    YOUR HUSBAND'S UNDERWEAR

            THAT IS
   AT LEAST THREE YEARS OLD,
    WOULD YOU CARRY THEM OUT
       IN A PLASTIC BAG,
         A WHEELBARROW,

          OR A U-HAUL?
            KELSEY?
         - I'M GONNA GO
     WITH THE PLASTIC BAG.

        - A PLASTIC BAG?
             - YES.
     - DOES HE HAVE A LOT?
    - NO. WE KEEP 'EM FRESH.

     - YOU KEEP 'EM FRESH?
          - OH, YEAH.
    - OKAY. HE DOESN'T HAVE,
 LIKE, A PAIR OF FAVORITE ONES
          THAT HE KEPT
 THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, DOES HE?

           - OH, NO,
  WE DON'T DO THE HOLEY THING.
           [laughing]
         - OKAY, STACY?

        - I'M GONNA SAY
         A PLASTIC BAG.
          HE DOES HAVE
      A LOT OF UNDERWEAR.
HIS MOM ALWAYS, EVERY CHRISTMAS,
     IS SUPPLYING NEW ONES.

     - SO IN A PLASTIC BAG.
             OKAY.
            CRYSTOL?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
         A WHEELBARROW.

        - A WHEELBARROW?
         - HE HAS QUITE
      A FEW FAVORITE ONES
      THAT HE'S HUNG ONTO
       FOR QUITE A WHILE.

      - HOW'D YOU LET HIM
     HANG ONTO 'EM SO LONG?
           - THEY'RE
      SLOWLY DISAPPEARING.
      - AHH! IN THE MIDDLE
         OF THE NIGHT,

       SHE CARTS THEM OUT
       IN A WHEELBARROW.
        - IT'S AMAZING.
            - OKAY.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.

    IF THERE WAS A SEX TAPE
  FEATURING YOUR HOTTEST NIGHT
           OF NOOKY,
  IT WOULD BE CALLED <i>THE GOOD,</i>
     <i>THE BAD, AND THE BLANK.</i>

             STACY?
      - <i>THE GOOD, THE BAD,</i>

          WE'RE JUST--
     DANTE MAKES ME LAUGH.
   WE'RE JUST A FUNNY COUPLE,

        AND I JUST THINK
       IT WOULD BE FUNNY.
   - WHAT ABOUT YOU CRYSTOL?
       - I HATE TO COPY,
BUT I'D HAVE TO SAY FUNNY, TOO.

   WE LAUGH A LOT, AND SO...
       - YOU LAUGH A LOT?
             - YES.
       I THINK THAT WOULD
        BE A PART OF IT.

     - SO IF I WAS WATCHING
            YOU TWO,
WOULD I JUST BE SITTING THERE--
    [laughing hysterically]
          - YOU MIGHT.
           YOU MIGHT.

    - HE PUT IT RIGHT THERE!
           [laughing]
   WOULD I BE LAUGHING, TOO?
      - WE--WE JUST LAUGH
         AT EVERYTHING,

      SO IT COULD HAPPEN.
   - KELSEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
          WITH SWEATY.

            - YEAH!

     - GOOD FOR CLEANSING.
             YEAH!
         OKAY, LADIES,
      IF YOU HAD TO ENROLL
            YOUR MAN

    IN OVEREATERS ANONYMOUS,
          IT WOULD BE
    BECAUSE OF HIS ADDICTION
       TO WHAT FOOD ITEM?

            CRYSTOL.
      - I'D SAY EGG ROLLS.
          - EGG ROLLS?
     - HE LOVES EGG ROLLS.

   - HE LOVES THE EGG ROLLS.
             OKAY.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, KELSEY?
            - UM...

       I WOULD HAVE TO GO
  WITH RANCH SUNFLOWER SEEDS.
    - RANCH SUNFLOWER SEEDS?
             - YES.
         - IS HE ALWAYS
         CHEWING 'EM UP

          AND SPITTING
        OUT THE THINGS?
          - OH, YEAH.
        - ALL THE TIME?
             - YEP.
    HE EVEN GOT ME ADDICTED.

   - SO YOU ALSO--[spitting]
          - WELL, NO.
  - YOU SPITTING ALL THE TIME?

    - I DO IT A LOT CLASSIER
       THAN THAT, BUT...
    - THEY ALWAYS SPIT IT IN
 THAT CUP, THE SUNFLOWER SEEDS.
            OKAY, SO
     RANCH SUNFLOWER SEEDS.

           - MM-HMM.
           - GOT YOU.
             STACY?
         - I'M GONNA GO
       WITH MEAT, STEAK.

       HE'S A MEAT EATER.
 HE COULD EAT IT FOR BREAKFAST,
       LUNCH, AND DINNER,
          IF HE COULD,
         IF I LET HIM.

       - OKAY, NOW HERE'S
      OUR BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE:
        SOMETHING WE DO
   LIKE AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE
           IS BLANK,

      BUT SOMETHING WE DO
   LIKE A COUPLE OF TEENAGERS
           IS BLANK.
            KELSEY?

        - THE FIRST PART
   WOULD PROBABLY BE BICKER.
        - BICKER? OKAY.
 - LIKE AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE.
             - YES.

         - MAKIN' OUT.

    - MAKIN' OUT, ALL RIGHT.
         GOT IT. STACY?
       - I'M GOING TO SAY
  LIKE AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE,
   I'M GONNA SAY BICKER, TOO,

         'CAUSE THAT'S
OUR ONLY FIGHTING IS BICKERING,
         AND WE'RE LIKE
AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE WITH THAT.
        LIKE TEENAGERS,

         I'M GONNA SAY

    - YEAH? THE MAKING OUT?
            - YEAH.

        - OKAY. CRYSTOL?
      - UM, I'M GONNA SAY
           BICKERING.
            WE HAVE
    REALLY STUPID ARGUMENTS,

   AND THEY JUST END QUICKLY,
    BUT, UM, LIKE TEENAGERS,
    I WOULD SAY THAT WE PLAY
          VIDEO GAMES.

        WE PLAY THE WII,
       AND THAT'S KIND OF
    WHAT BROUGHT US TOGETHER
            WHEN WE
  FIRST STARTED DATING, SO...

   and Y was the competitor.

  Is that something you would
    pay for year after year?
