WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH MORE

        I've worked hard
       to build my y family.
  And also to build my career.
 So I'm not about to always let
   my frequent bladder urges,

      or the worry my pipes
    might leak get in the way
     of my busy lifestyle.
     That's why I take care,
         with VESIcare.

  Once-daily VESIcare can help
   control your bladder muscle
     and is proven to treat
       overactive bladder
        with symptoms of

    frequent urges and leaks
         day and night.
 If you have certain stomach or
       glaucoma problems,
      or trouble emptying
         your bladder,

     do not take VESIcare.
   VESIcare may cause allergic
 reactions that may be serious.
  If you experience swelling of
         the face, lips,

        throat or tongue,
      stop taking VESIcare
     and get emergency help.
 Tell your doctor right away if
 you have severe abdominal pain,

 or become constipated for three
          or more days.
          VESIcare may
      cause blurred vision,
  so use caution while driving
     or doing unsafe tasks.

       Common side effects
  are dry mouth, constipation,
        and indigestion.
        I've worked hard
     to get to where I am...

       and I've got better
          places to go
           than always
     going to the bathroom.
 So take charge of your symptoms
    by talking to your doctor

     and go to vesicare.com
     for a free trial offer.

  AMERICA'S LEADING AUTHORITY
            ON LOVE,
        SHERRI SHEPHERD.

            - HELLO!
         HI, EVERYBODY.
              HEY!

              HI!
     COUPLES, HOW ARE YOU?
     [cheers and applause]
     OKAY, THANK YOU, GARY.

  WELCOME TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
         YOU KNOW WHAT,
        JUST THINK OF IT
     AS THE COURT OF LOVE.

         NO JUDGMENTS,
BUT YOUR RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT
     IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN.
         NOW LET'S SEE
 WHO'S IN THE HOT SEAT TONIGHT.

           - SHERRI,
    MEET COUPLE NUMBER ONE.
      AARON AND DAWN LIKE
          TO HAVE SEX
   ON THEIR DINING ROOM TABLE
   IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MEAL.

  SO THAT'S DINNER AND A SHOW.
       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
       GEORGE AND ERICA.
   THANKS TO A WAXING MISHAP,

   SHE WALKED DOWN THE AISLE
     WITH NO RIGHT EYEBROW.
      SOMETHING BORROWED,
        SOMETHING BLUE,
        AND, OH, MY GOD,
     WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
       MIKE AND ALLISON.
       HE'S FROM ENGLAND.
        SHE'S FROM HERE.
        BUT SHE'S SO BAD
       BEHIND THE WHEEL,

           IT'S SAFER
       FOR HIM TO DRIVE,
         EVEN IF IT IS
 ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE ROAD.
      BACK TO YOU, SHERRI.

     [cheers and applause]
      - WELCOME, COUPLES.
       GOOD LUCK TO YOU.
           [applause]

     YOU BEAUTIFUL LADIES,
           I NEED YOU
          TO STAND UP,
         GO BACKSTAGE,
     BECAUSE WE GOT TO ASK
         YOUR HUSBANDS

        SOME QUESTIONS.
        ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
       I AM GONNA ASK YOU
        THREE QUESTIONS.

 IT'S GONNA BE UP TO YOUR WIVES
     TO MATCH YOUR ANSWERS.
           THE COUPLE
      WITH THE MOST POINTS

     AT THE END OF THE GAME
            WILL WIN
 A FANTASTIC SECOND HONEYMOON.
       YOU READY, FELLAS?

     ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
           GENTLEMEN,
IF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WAS A CAR,
         HOW MANY TIMES
       DID IT BREAK DOWN

       BEFORE YOU MADE IT
         TO THE ALTAR?
             NEVER,
 IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY RELIABLE,
         OCCASIONALLY,
  BUT IT WAS QUICKLY REPAIRED,

           OR WAS IT
    CONSTANTLY STALLING OUT?
             AARON?
 - I'M GONNA SAY THE FIRST ONE.

        - THE FIRST ONE,
        WHICH WAS NEVER.
            - NEVER.
- IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY RELIABLE.
   - I'M GONNA GO WITH THAT.
        - THERE YOU GO.

           ALL RIGHT,
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, GEORGE?
 - I'M GONNA SAY OCCASIONALLY.
           JUST BASED
 ON THE EYEBROW INCIDENT ALONE.

         OCCASIONALLY.
           [laughter]
        - OCCASIONALLY,
  BUT IT WAS QUICKLY REPAIRED.

             - YES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             MIKE.
        - I WOULD SAY--
     WE WERE LONG-DISTANCE
         FOR TWO YEARS,

 SO I'D SAY IT TOOK US A WHILE
      TO GET TO THE ALTAR,
  SO THE SECOND ONE, I THINK.
       - THE SECOND ONE,
    WHICH WAS OCCASIONALLY,

  BUT IT WAS QUICKLY REPAIRED.
   - YEAH, QUICKLY REPAIRED,
  AND WE GOT THERE EVENTUALLY.
      - AND YOU GOT THERE,
      AND NOW YOU'RE HERE.

     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
        OTHER THAN BEING
      ON <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>
     WHAT IS THE LAST THING
     YOU AND YOUR NEW BRIDE

      DID THAT WAS WORTHY
   OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE?
            GEORGE.
  - WE GOT MARRIED ON A BEACH
  AND WENT DOWN A MONTH PRIOR.

            - YEAH.
 - AND WE CHRISTENED THE BEACH
     RIGHT THEN AND THERE.
             - OH!
 WAS THERE ANYBODY ELSE AROUND

    WHEN YOU CHRISTENED IT?
        - I DON'T KNOW.
       I THOUGHT I HEARD
     A COUPLE HONKS MAYBE.

           [laughter]
          - ALL RIGHT.
           AND, MIKE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

- UM, I MIGHT SAY THE RECEPTION
    TO OUR WEDDING ACTUALLY.
     WE HAD A BIG OPEN BAR.
      PEOPLE TRIPPED OVER
      AND HURT THEMSELVES.

    THERE WAS A LOT OF, UH--
    A LOT OF THINGS GOING ON
  THAT I THINK WOULD BE WORTHY
     OF A STUDIO AUDIENCE.
           - OH, WOW,
      YOU HAD AN OPEN BAR?

             - YES.
        - I'D HAVE COME,
  AND I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU.
          AN OPEN BAR.
           ALL RIGHT.
             AARON.

         - I WOULD SAY,
    KEEPING WITH THE THEME,
          WHAT WE DID
     ON THE KITCHEN TABLE--
     OR THE DINING TABLE--
   - THE KITCHEN TABLE? WAIT.

      - NO, DINING TABLE.
      - THE DINING TABLE.
       - ONLY ONE TABLE.
             SORRY.
      - ALL RIGHT, AARON.

       ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
 OUR FINAL QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
    GUYS, TWO OF YOUR HANDS
          PUT TOGETHER
       ARE ABOUT THE SIZE
   OF YOUR WIFE'S WHAT? MIKE.

   - YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA TRY
AND BE SWEET AND SAY HER SMILE.
   SHE HAS A WONDERFUL SMILE,
  AND IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST
THINGS THAT ATTRACTED ME TO HER.

        SO I'D SAY THAT.
  IT JUST LIGHTS UP ANY ROOM.
      - OKAY. WE GOT YOU.
     AARON, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
          - [exhales]

  THIS SHOW IS MAKING ME SWEAT
         AT THIS POINT.
  - YEAH, WE LOVE TO MAKE YOU
   SWEAT ON <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
     - I'M GONNA GO WITH--
      I LOVE HER DERRIERE,

          AND I THINK
  IT'S PERFECTLY PROPORTIONED.
           AND I'LL--
    PERFECTLY COVERS AND...
     - SO TWO OF YOUR HANDS
          PUT TOGETHER

 ARE HER PERFECTLY-PROPORTIONED
           DERRIERE.
        - OH, BOY. YUP.
        - THERE YOU GO.

       ALL RIGHT, GEORGE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I GOT TO SAY HER BOOBS.
          - HER BOOBS!
          - HER BOOBS.

   SO HOW WOULD YOU PUT YOUR
 TWO HANDS TOGETHER TO DO THAT?
            YEAH-OH!
       - I GOT BIG HANDS.
        - LOOK AT THAT.

      THE THUMBS TOUCHING.
     GENTLEMEN, I LOVE IT.
           NICE JOB.
      WHILE WE'RE WAITING
FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN, GARY,

        YOU MUST TELL US
  ABOUT THAT SECOND HONEYMOON

           WANNA GO.

     CAN SOMEBODY TAKE ME?
         OKAY, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB

TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     EARNS YOU FIVE POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

  LADIES, IF YOUR RELATIONSHIP
           WAS A CAR,
HOW MANY TIMES DID YOUR HUSBANDS
       SAY IT BROKE DOWN
       BEFORE YOU MADE IT
         TO THE ALTAR?

             NEVER,
 IT'S BEEN COMPLETELY RELIABLE,
         OCCASIONALLY,
  BUT IT WAS QUICKLY REPAIRED,
           OR WAS IT
    CONSTANTLY STALLING OUT?

             DAWN.
  - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY NEVER,
    'CAUSE AARON IS PERFECT

    AND I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.
           all: AWW.
   - AARON, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

 - NEVER, COMPLETELY RELIABLE.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
            - WHOO!

      - ALL RIGHT, ERICA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I WOULD SAY NEVER.
   ONLY ENGAGED THREE MONTHS.

     NO TIME TO REALLY HAVE
         ANY PROBLEMS.
      - ALL RIGHT, NEVER,
      COMPLETELY RELIABLE.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, GEORGE?

         OCCASIONALLY,
     BUT QUICKLY REPAIRED.
           [laughter]
      - IT'S THE EYEBROW.

        - EVERYBODY HAS
      ONE EYEBROW MOMENT.
      ALL RIGHT, ALLISON,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- I'D HAVE TO SAY OCCASIONALLY,
 BECAUSE WE WERE LONG-DISTANCE

          FOR SO LONG
          THAT, YEAH,
    OF COURSE THERE'S GOING
    TO BE BUMPS IN THE ROAD.
        - OCCASIONALLY,
     BUT QUICKLY REPAIRED.

       - YES, DEFINITELY.
   - WHAT DID YOU SAY, MIKE?
         OCCASIONALLY,
     [cheers and applause]

             YEAH.
      ALL RIGHT, COUPLES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
        OTHER THAN BEING
      ON <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>

   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBANDS SAY
       IS THE LAST THING
       THE TWO OF YOU DID
        THAT WAS WORTHY
   OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE?

             ERICA.
         - I WOULD SAY
     JUST GETTING MARRIED.
    WE'VE ONLY BEEN MARRIED
          A FEW WEEKS,

     SO JUST ABOUT A MONTH.
      - SO ABOUT A MONTH.
        GETTING MARRIED
           IS WORTHY
   OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE?

         - OH, TOTALLY.
   - OKAY, GEORGE, YOU LAUGH.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
            - I SAID
    WE CHRISTENED THE BEACH.

  - YOU CHRISTENED THE BEACH.
         ERICA, TELL US
    ABOUT THIS CHRISTENING.
           [laughter]

         WHAT HAPPENED?
    - I HAD SAND IN CREVICES
    THAT I DON'T EVEN KNOW--
          - OH, GIRL!

           [laughter]
         OKAY, ALLISON,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - I DON'T KNOW.
   OUR DANCES IN THE MORNING

         ARE PRETTY...
  - WHAT DANCES DO YOU GUYS DO
        IN THE MORNING?
- OH, YOU KNOW, JUST PRE-SHOWER,
  AROUND-THE-APARTMENT DANCES

          THAT WE DO.
- WE'D ACTUALLY LOVE TO SEE IT.
   DO YOU WANT TO DO IT HERE?

           [laughter]
         YOU DON'T WANT
      TO DO ANYTHING HERE?
            COME ON.

         - AT THE END.
     WE'LL DANCE AT THE END
          OF THE SHOW.
 - THAT'S WHAT THEY ALWAYS SAY.

   "WE'LL DO IT AT THE END."
     ALL RIGHT, SO YOU SAY
  YOUR DANCING IN THE MORNING.

             - YES.
            - OKAY.
    MIKE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           - SIMILAR.
    - OUR WEDDING RECEPTION.

 - THERE WAS A LOT OF DANCING.
             - OH.
         - OKAY, DAWN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - [sighs and laughs]

           - TELL US.
        - GETTING IT ON
     IN CONTESTANT ROOM C.
        - YOU GOT IT ON
   IN THE CONTESTANT ROOM C?

    HERE AT <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME</i>
         <i>ON THE STUDIO?</i>
        - WE HAD A LOT--
     WE HAD A LOT OF TIME.
           [applause]

       THEY MAKE YOU WAIT
          FOR A WHILE.
          - SO IT WAS
     IN CONTESTANT ROOM C.
       ALL RIGHT, AARON,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

      YOU SAID YOU HAD SEX
   ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE.
- OH. WELL, WE TALKED ABOUT THAT
       IN THE BEGINNING.
     - WE TALKED ABOUT THAT

  YOU WERE HOLDING OUT ON US,
             AARON.
          - I FIGURED
    THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR NOW.
             - NO!
             WHAT?

     [cheers and applause]
              OH.
        I'M TELLING YOU,
    IF THE WALLS COULD TALK

     IN CONTESTANT ROOM C.
           ALL RIGHT.
         LAST QUESTION.

   ACCORDING TO YOUR HUSBAND,
 TWO OF HIS HANDS PUT TOGETHER
       ARE ABOUT THE SIZE
         OF YOUR WHAT?

            ALLISON.
    - WELL, I'D HAVE TO SAY

    But last year my daughter
     was checking up on me.
      I wasn't eating well.

        She's a dietitian
     and she suggested I try
BOOST Complete Nutritional Drink
    to help get the nutrition
         I was missing.

    Now I drink it every day,

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       IT IS TIME FOR YOU

   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
   HERE'S OUR FIRST QUESTION.

     WHEN YOU GUYS WENT OUT
      ON YOUR FIRST DATE,
   WHICH OF YOUR FIVE SENSES
   DID YOUR HUSBAND APPEAL TO
           THE MOST?

             DAWN.
     - I'M GONNA SAY SIGHT.
   I KNOW IT SOUNDS A LITTLE
BORING, BUT, ON OUR FIRST DATE,
  WE WENT TO ROOSEVELT ISLAND.

 HE ACTUALLY SHOWED ME AROUND--
 IT'S GONNA SOUND CREEPY TOO--
       ALL THE ABANDONED,
        LIKE, BUILDINGS,
      THE MENTAL HOSPITAL,
        AND EVERYTHING.

 IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND OF COOL.
   - I THINK IT'S VERY COOL.
      - BECAUSE EVERYTHING
         WAS OVERGROWN.
     IT LOOKED LIKE RUINS,

BUT IT WAS, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING
    THAT HE WAS REALLY INTO.
    YOU KNOW, OLD BUILDINGS
           AND STUFF.
            - RIGHT,
       AND YOU HAD TO USE

        YOUR IMAGINATION
    ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON
    IN THE MENTAL FACILITY.
      - EXACTLY. YES. YES.

       GREAT WAY TO START
      A RELATIONSHIP, YES.
  - KIND OF SEXY-CREEPY-SEXY.
        - A LITTLE BIT.
   - THAT WAS GOOD. SO SIGHT.
         - SIGHT, YES.

            - OKAY.
     ERICA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I'M GONNA SAY SMELL.
 I'M OBSESSED WITH THE COLOGNE
           HE WEARS.

    WHEN HE LEAVES THE HOUSE
        IN THE MORNING,
     I PUT HIS T-SHIRT ON.
     I HAVE TO SIT IN HIS,

           LIKE, AURA
         OF HIS SMELL.
 - OH, YOU JUST SIT IN THE AURA
             AND...
       - I JUST LOVE IT.
     - THAT'S SO VERY COOL.

           ALL RIGHT,
           SO SMELL.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, ALLISON?
  - WELL, I HAVE TO SAY SIGHT,

 BECAUSE MIKE'S GOT THAT, LIKE,
    HUGH GRANT HANDSOMENESS
           ABOUT HIM,
        AND, OOH, YEAH.
       DEFINITELY SIGHT.
          - ALL RIGHT.

      HERE WE GO, LADIES.
         NEXT QUESTION.
        IF YOUR HUSBAND
     WERE TO HAVE AN ORGASM
 OVER A NON-SEXUAL EXPERIENCE,

       WHAT WOULD IT BE?
             ERICA.
        - I DON'T KNOW.
 IT'D PROBABLY BE FOOD-RELATED,
         AND IT'D HAVE
      TO INCLUDE KETCHUP.

           [laughter]
  HE'S OBSESSED WITH KETCHUP.
HE PUTS KETCHUP ON HIS KETCHUP.

   - AN ORGASM OVER KETCHUP.
            - YEAH.
         - YOU'RE LIKE
    HIS LITTLE HOT DOG, HUH?
           - EXACTLY.

  - WITH THE KETCHUP ON THERE.
       - ALL RIGHT. OKAY.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, ALLISON?

     - IT HAS TO BE SOCCER
OR, AS MIKE WILL SAY, FOOTBALL.
          - ALL RIGHT.
         GOT IT. DAWN.
   - I'M GONNA SAY FOOD ALSO.

      - WHAT KIND OF FOOD?
       - IF I HAD TO PICK
        A TYPE OF FOOD,
    I WOULD SAY INDIAN FOOD.
   - INDIAN FOOD. HE LOVES...

    - HE LOVES INDIAN FOOD,
          HANDS DOWN.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       THIS NEXT QUESTION
    IS FROM FAMOUS FOOTWEAR,

      YOUR FAVORITE BRANDS
     FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY.
        WHICH FAMOUS TOM
    WOULD YOUR HUSBAND CLAIM
   HE MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLES?

    BRADY, CRUISE, OR HANKS?
            ALLISON.
  - I'D HAVE TO GO TOM CRUISE,

 BECAUSE I THINK MIKE SECRETLY
       ALWAYS WANTS TO BE
     AN ACTION MOVIE STAR.
          - OH, YEAH?

          OKAY, DAWN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I'M GONNA SAY TOM HANKS.
       - TOM HANKS. WHY?

         - WELL, AARON,
       HE IS VERY FUNNY,
      BUT I THINK HE LIKES
  TO THINK HE'S REALLY FUNNY.
  AND TOM HANKS IS THE COMEDIC
    ACTOR OUT OF THE THREE.

   I DON'T THINK HE WOULD SAY
   EITHER OF THE OTHER ONES.
     - OKAY, SO TOM HANKS.
        GOT YOU. ERICA.
      - TOTALLY TOM HANKS.
  GEORGE IS AN ALL-AROUND GUY.

            I THINK
   TOM'S AN ALL-AROUND ACTOR.
       HE COULD BE FUNNY.
     HE COULD BE SENSITIVE.
         HE COULD BE--
       HE'S JUST CLASSIC.

           SO I THINK
   GEORGE IS JUST LIKE THAT.
          - TOM HANKS.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
   HERE'S OUR BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.

      IN THIS PARTNERSHIP

          ON ONE ITEM
           WAS BLANK.
 AND THE THING THEY SPENT IT ON
             DAWN.

     - I'LL SAY IT WAS ME,
           AND IT WAS
   OUR FLAT-PANEL TELEVISION.
         - YOU LIKE IT?

     - OH, YEAH. OH, YEAH.
            - OKAY.
             ERICA.
          - IT WAS ME,
   AND IT WAS YANKEE TICKETS

  FOR OUR ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY
    THAT WE KNEW EACH OTHER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            ALLISON.
             - OH,
   THIS IS NOT VERY EXCITING,

 BUT I'M PRETTY SURE IT WAS ME
        PAYING THE RENT.
     - YOU PAYING THE RENT.
            GOT IT.
   LADIES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

        WHEN WE RETURN,
        WE'RE GONNA SEE
       IF THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

  MORE PROCESSED FLAKES LOOK
  NOTHING LIKE NATURAL GRAINS.

     NUTRITION YOU CAN SEE.
         GREAT GRAINS.

 FOR MULTI GRAIN FLAKES THAT ARE
 AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF FIBER

       I I WISH MY PATIENTS
      COULD SEE WHAT I SEE.
         THAT OVER TIME,

     HAVING HIGH CHOLESTEROL
        PLUS DIABETES...
        OR FAMILY HISTORY
    OF EARLY HEART DISEASE...
 CAN PUT THEM AT INCREASED RISK
       FOR PLAQUE BUILDUP.

         AND THEY'D SEE
    THAT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT
    TO GET THEIR CHOLESTEROL
    WHERE THEIR DOCTOR WANTS.

   AND WHY FOR THESE PATIENTS,
     WHEN DIET AND EXERCISE
      ALONE AREN'T ENOUGH,
      I PRESCRIBE CRESTOR.

         ADDING CRESTOR
     LOWERS BAD CHOLESTEROL
          BY UP TO 52%.
       AND IS ALSO PROVEN
     TO SLOW PLAQUE BUILDUP.

   <i>THESE COULD BE SIGNS OF RARE</i>
    <i>BUT SERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS.</i>
       IS YOUR CHOLESTEROL

              WHERE
       YOUR DOCTOR WANTS?
         ASK YOUR DOCTOR
  IF CRESTOR IS RIGHT FOR YOU.
   <i>[ Female Announcer ] IF YOU</i>

            IT SAYS,
  'YOU CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER.'
         YOU'RE RIGHT.

  Captioning provided by GSN.
    AND NOW, AMERICA'S MOST
    PASSIONATE PEEPING TOM,

        SHERRI SHEPHERD.
      - HELLO, EVERYBODY.
              HI!
           HEY, GUYS!

           WELCOME TO

   THE SHOW THAT REVEALS WHAT
GOES ON AFTER THE LIGHTS GO OUT.

   WE HAVE THREE NEW COUPLES
        WITH US TONIGHT.
     LET'S MEET THEM, GARY.
  - SHERRI, COUPLE NUMBER ONE.
     STEVEN AND CHRISTINA.

   SHE SURPRISED HIM AT THEIR
  WEDDING WITH A SALSA DANCE.
      SADLY THE ONLY THING
      HE KNEW ABOUT SALSA
      WAS THAT HE LIKED IT
    WITH HIS TORTILLA CHIPS.

       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
      SHRAF AND EVELYN...
    LIKE TO DO IT IN PUBLIC.
    BUT THEY'VE BEEN CAUGHT
        BY THE NEIGHBOR,

          HER BROTHER,
        AND HER MOTHER.
   WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY TO BE
   OUTLAWED BY YOUR IN-LAWS.
    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE,

         CHAD AND PEP.
       HE WAS A STRIPPER,
   AND SHE WAS A HOOTERS GIRL
      WHO LOVES THREESOMES
       AND NUDE BEACHES.

HMM...WHICH EXPLAINS WHY GUESTS
       THREW DOLLAR BILLS
        INSTEAD OF RICE
       AT THEIR WEDDING!
      BACK TO YOU, SHERRI.

          - [laughing]
      OKAY, CHAD AND PEP.
         I WANT TO KNOW
    ABOUT THESE THREESOMES.

  WHO CHOOSES THE EXTRA GUESTS
    AND WHO SCHMOOZES THEM?
  - WELL, I'LL POINT THEM OUT
      AND I'LL LET HER GO
            WORK HER
          MAGIC ON IT.

     - YOU GET ANOTHER GUY,
     OR DO YOU GET A GIRL?
         - ANOTHER GUY.
       - OH, ANOTHER GUY.
  SO YOU'D LOOK AT ME AND GO,
         "OH, NOT HER."

             OKAY.
           - I WOULD.
            - OKAY.
           ALL RIGHT.
       OH, MY GOD--OKAY,
     SO, SHRAF AND EVELYN.

        OKAY, THAT JUST
          AIN'T RIGHT.
     FORGET ABOUT THE MOM,
       BECAUSE I CAN SEE
            HOW THAT
         COULD HAPPEN.

       BUT THE NEIGHBORS?
       - WE WERE ACTUALLY
        IN OUR OWN CAR,
       AND WE WERE PARKED
      ON A PUBLIC STREET.

        AND SOMEONE JUST
     CAME OUT OF HIS HOUSE
   AND FELT THAT HE MUST HAVE
     BEEN BORED THAT NIGHT
             AND HE
     KNOCKED ON THE WINDOW.

        - I DON'T KNOW,
     I GUESS IF I CAME OUT
  AND I SAW SOMETHING GOING ON
      THAT WAS BETTER THAN
      WHAT I HAD GOING ON
  I'D KNOCK ON THE WINDOW TOO.

           ALL RIGHT,
    SO, STEVEN WHAT HAPPENED
 WHEN YOUR WIFE STARTED SHOWING
   OFF HER SPICY SALSA MOVES?
   - OH, I TRIED TO KEEP UP,
           BUT I WAS

       PRETTY MUCH HAPPY
        TO STEP IN BACK
          AND LET HER
         RUN THE SHOW.
  - YOU LET HER RUN THE SHOW?
          - AS ALWAYS.

   - WELL, WELCOME, COUPLES.
    GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU.
   NOW, LADIES, WHY DON'T YOU
         HEAD BACKSTAGE
  SO WE CAN ASK YOUR HUSBANDS
        A FEW QUESTIONS.

        ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
        I'M GOING TO ASK
     Y'ALL THREE QUESTIONS,
  AND IT'S GONNA BE UP TO YOUR
  WIVES TO MATCH YOUR ANSWERS.

THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST POINTS
     AT THE END OF THE GAME
      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
       SECOND HONEYMOON.
      SO IF YOU'RE READY,
   HERE'S THE FIRST QUESTION.

           GENTLEMEN.

     - COME ON AND EXPLAIN!
       - SHE SPEAKS WELL,
      AND AT CERTAIN TIMES

       IT CAN BE USED FOR
  OTHER ACTIVITIES, SO IT'S...

          - THE MOUTH.
  LIKE WHAT, WALKING THE DOG?

         - THE HOO-HA.
           - I'LL GO
        WITH THE HOO-HA,

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.

        IT IS YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
  HERE IS OUR FIRST QUESTION.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.

             IF YOU
        STARTED SINGING
  <i>99 BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL</i>
   AT THE START OF YOUR LAST
ROMANTIC ROMP WITH YOUR HUSBAND,

        HOW MANY BOTTLES
           WOULD HAVE
     STILL BEEN ON THE WALL
       WHEN HE FINISHED?
           CHRISTINA?

   - WE'RE GONNA GO WITH 70.
       WE'LL GO WITH 70.
   - YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH 70?
            - YEAH.
     I'M GONNA GO WITH 70.
            - OKAY.

  NOW, WHAT ABOUT YOU, EVELYN?
      - WE'LL GO WITH 85.
      - YOU'LL GO WITH 85?
      - LET'S GO WITH 85.
            - OKAY.
   - THAT SOUNDS ABOUT GOOD.

   - AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, PEP?
    - I'M GONNA GO PROBABLY
 RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE AND GO 50.
             - OH!
              OH!

   YOU GUYS HAD A LOT OF TIME
   TO GO DO A LITTLE TALKING,
       GO BACK, YOU KNOW.
            - YEAH.
  - IT WAS NICE AND LEISURELY.
        - KEEP IT GOING.

       - OH, MY GOODNESS.
           ALL RIGHT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
      THE <i>MTV MOVIE AWARDS</i>
      <i>NOW HONORS THE BEST</i>

      WTF MOMENT IN FILM.
         THINKING BACK
      TO YOUR WEDDING DAY,
          WHAT MOMENT
     WOULD TAKE THAT PRIZE?

            EVELYN?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
   WHEN MY FAMILY LEFT EARLY.
         THAT WAS WTF.

     I WISH THEY WERE THERE
          THROUGHOUT--
  UNTIL THE END OF THE NIGHT.
            - OKAY.
 OKAY, AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, PEP?

  - I WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH--
   IT WAS TAKING LONG FOR ME
      TO GET MY HAIR DONE,
AND CHAD WAS STARTING TO PANIC.
            - YEAH?

      - SO I THINK THAT'S
       WHAT HE WOULD SAY.
        - OKAY, GOTCHA.
           CHRISTINA?
      - THE WTF HAD TO BE,

          AND IS, UM,
   MY MAID OF HONOR'S SPEECH.
       WHAT DID SHE SAY?

           - NOTHING!
     BUT IT KEPT GOING ON!
IT WAS--IT WAS LIKE FIVE MINUTES
       AND I WAS WAITING
    FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN,

     AND IT NEVER HAPPENED,
       BUT IT KEPT GOING.
        AND SHE'S LIKE,
    "YO, I GOT STORIES, YO.
 I GOT--Y'ALL DON'T EVEN KNOW,
      YO. I GOT STORIES."

AND WE WAS WAITING FOR A STORY.
   I WAS WAITING FOR A STORY.
    I'M GONNA GO WITH THAT.
    ALL THE WAY, ABSOLUTELY.
          - I LOVE IT.
             OKAY.

     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
    JUST LIKE OUR NEWLYWEDS,
       PLAYTEX BRAS KNOWS
     THE VALUE YOU'LL FIND
      IN THE PERFECT FIT.

  NOW WHERE ARE THE TWO OF YOU
         MOST IN SYNC?
        IN THE KITCHEN,
      ON THE DANCE FLOOR,
       OR IN THE BEDROOM?

             - PEP?
- OH, DEFINITELY IN THE BEDROOM.
            - YEAH?
             OKAY.
           CHRISTINA?

       - HE CAN'T DANCE.
      - IF HE CAN'T DANCE,
    WHY DID YOU HAVE A SAMBA
        AT YOUR WEDDING?

- 'CAUSE I'M PUERTO RICAN, GIRL.
     I GOTTA--COME ON, NOW.
           I HAD TO.

          I TOLD THEM
       IT WAS 15 SECONDS.
         BUT SURPRISE,
     IT WAS THE WHOLE SONG.
          I WAS LIKE,
   "JUST KEEP GOING." BA BA!

          - [laughing]
        - FOLLOW MOMMY.
      - JUST FOLLOW MOMMY.
           - EXACTLY.
          I'M GONNA GO
       WITH THE BEDROOM.

       - YOU'RE GONNA GO
       WITH THE BEDROOM?
     - I'M GONNA DEFINITELY
      GO WITH THE BEDROOM.
    - SO HE MAY NOT BE ABLE
       TO SALSA OR SAMBA,

     BUT HE CAN PUT IT DOWN
        IN THE BEDROOM.
        - YEAH, HE DOES.
             - AH.
           ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, EVELYN?

     - I'M DEFINITELY GONNA
   GO WITH THE BEDROOM, TOO.
        AFTER TEN YEARS,
 WE'VE STILL GOT THE CHEMISTRY.
        STILL GOIN' ON.

AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S 85 BOTTLES,
     WE STILL GOT IT GOOD.
            - YEAH?
           ALL RIGHT!
  ALL RIGHT. OKAY, NOW HERE'S
      OUR BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS,
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
            LADIES,
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

        MY HUSBAND AND I
        ARE REALLY OPEN
        WHEN IT COMES TO
       DISCUSSING BLANK,
   BUT THE ONE TOPIC WE AVOID
    TALKING ABOUT IS BLANK.

           CHRISTINA?
             - SEX?
        WHOOPEE, RIGHT?
            - OKAY.

        - AND THE TOPIC
   WE AVOID SPEAKING ABOUT...
           OUR PASTS.
        - IS YOUR PASTS?
            - YEAH.

           - GOTCHA.
    EVELYN, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH,
        I GUESS, FAMILY,
AND WE DON'T REALLY LIKE TO TALK
  ABOUT MY SHOPPING TOO MUCH.

          THAT KINDA--
  WE KEEP THAT UNDER THE RUG.
          - WHAT IS IT
      ABOUT YOUR SHOPPING?
     - IT'S JUST TOO MUCH.
    - PEP, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

       - DEFINITELY SEX.
 AND WHAT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT,
     I'LL GO WITH POLITICS.
       - YEAH, WHO WANTS
     TO TALK ABOUT POLITICS

  WHEN YOU CAN TALK ABOUT SEX.
           THAT'S IT.
           ALL RIGHT.
   THAN YOU SO MUCH, LADIES.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
    WE'RE GONNA SEE IF THEIR

          HUSBANDS CAN
      MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
