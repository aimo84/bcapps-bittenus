       AND NOW YOUR HOST,
        SHERRI SHEPHERD.

          - ALL RIGHT.
         THANKS, GARY.
     NOW THE GUYS ARE BACK
           TO SEE IF
         THEY CAN MATCH
     THEIR WIVES' ANSWERS.

           LET'S SEE
        HOW THEY'LL DO.
        HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
  AND THE FIRST QUESTION IS...

           GENTLEMEN.
  IF YOUR WIFE STARTED SINGING
  <i>99 BOTTLES OF BEER ON THE WALL</i>
   AT THE START OF YOUR LAST
         ROMANTIC ROMP,

        HOW MANY BOTTLES
   WOULD STILL BE ON THE WALL
       WHEN YOU FINISHED?
           ALL RIGHT.
            STEVEN?

        - THERE WOULD BE
       NO MORE BEER LEFT.
             - OH!
NOW THAT'S WHAT I LIKE TO HEAR.
           ALL RIGHT.
  CHRISTINA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

           - DID YOU
       HEAR THE QUESTION?
     IT SAID THE LAST TIME
        WE DID WHOOPEE.
     - SHE SAID 70 BOTTLES.
           ALL RIGHT.

    SHRAF, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
         - I'LL SAY 80.
      - 80 WOULD STILL BE
 ON THE WALL WHEN YOU FINISHED?

          WHY IS THAT?
    - 'CAUSE IT'S REALISTIC.
- I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.
      THAT'S VERY HONEST.
     YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA
        BEEF IT UP ANY.

- NO, IT'S TV, BUT IT'S STILL--
     IT'S STILL MY REALITY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
 WELL, LET'S DO A REALITY CHECK
        WITH YOUR WIFE.

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - I SAID 85.
             - 85.
    - I'LL LEAVE SOME BEERS
         FOR LATER ON,

          AND THEN WE
     GET BACK AT THE WALL.
     - YEAH, THERE YOU GO.
        - I LIKE THE WAY
      YOU LOOK AT THINGS.

   - THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY.
       LET'S HAVE A KISS.
          - I LOVE IT.
     CHAD, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

            - WELL,
     THAT WAS THIS MORNING
   TO, YOU KNOW, KIND OF TAKE
    THE EDGE OFF FOR TODAY.
   SO, UM, IT WAS A QUICKIE.
       SO I'D SAY 90. 90.

        - YOU'D SAY 90?
     NOW, YOU OF ALL PEOPLE
         I WOULD EXPECT
            TO HAVE
       A VERY LOW NUMBER.

        - YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES.
            - OKAY.
    - THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE,
     WE'VE GOTTA GET READY.

    SO I'M LIKE, ALL RIGHT,
 CAN WE JUST GET IT OVER WITH?"
           YOU KNOW?
    LET'S DO IT, JUST DO IT.
          GIVE ME ONE,
      GIVE ME A SHOT HERE.

   GIVE ME A BONE, ALL RIGHT?
COME ON, LET'S DO IT, YOU KNOW?
  - SO SHE GAVE YOU 9 BOTTLES.
      - YES, 90 BOTTLES IS
    WHAT MY ANSWER WOULD BE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT DID YOU SAY, PEP?
      SHE SAID 50 BOTTLES.
   - THAT'S NOT THIS MORNING.
    THAT'S NOT THIS MORNING.
NO, WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

     I DON'T KNOW HOW FAST
      SHE SINGS THAT SONG,
 BUT THAT WASN'T THIS MORNING.
   - I WAS THINKING OVERALL.
   - OH, IT'S ON AVERAGE NOW.

    - ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
    GO TO OUR NEXT QUESTION.
           GENTLEMEN.
      THE <i>MTV MOVIE AWARDS</i>

      NOW HONORS THE BEST
      WTF MOMENT IN FILM.
         THINKING BACK
      TO YOUR WEDDING DAY,
 WHAT MOMENT DID YOUR WIFE SAY
     WOULD TAKE THAT PRIZE?

             SHRAF?
    - WHEN MY SISTER-IN-LAWS
     GOT INTO AN ARGUMENT.
 - NOW WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY?

          - WAH, WAH.
          I SAID WHEN
     MY FAMILY LEFT EARLY.
           - WHEN HER
       FAMILY LEFT EARLY.

 - COME ON BABE, THAT WAS MORE
 IMPORTANT THAN THE DAMN FIGHT.
  - DID IT DEVASTATE YOU TOO?
       OR JUST YOUR WIFE?
       - IT DEVASTATED ME
    BECAUSE IT AFFECTS HER.

        SO IT'S, IT'S--
   DO I GET POINTS FOR THAT?
           [laughter]
    - YOU DO WITH YOUR WIFE.

           ALL RIGHT.
 SO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO CHAD.
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- UM, IT WOULD HAVE ONLY BEEN--
   WE WERE ON A CRUISE SHIP,

  YOU KNOW, AND SO SHE WENT UP
      TO GET HER HAIR DONE
 BEFORE WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE
PICKED UP TO GO TO OUR WEDDING.
     AND IT WAS, YOU KNOW,
        TAKING FOREVER.

      I WAS, LIKE, DRESSED
       AND I WAS PACING,
     AND I WAS LIKE WHAT--
      WELL, I GUESS, WTF!
   SO THERE'S MY WTF MOMENT--
    IT WAS WAITING FOR HER.

        IT TOOK A WHILE
   FOR HER HAIR TO GET DONE.
     LONGER THAN EXPECTED.
       - DID SHE MAKE IT?
    - OH, YEAH, WE MADE IT.

  BUT, YOU KNOW, I JUST STRESS
     ABOUT A LOT OF STUFF.
   - AH, BUT NO STRESS THERE.
     WHAT DID YOU SAY, PEP?
     MY HAIR TOOK TOO LONG!
             YEAH.

       ALL RIGHT, STEVEN.
    AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
      - IT WAS DEFINITELY
       THE WEDDING CAKE.
     THE PEOPLE ON THE CAKE
       LOOKED LIKE OGRES.

            - WHAT?
   SO HOW DID YOUR WIFE FEEL
ABOUT THE TOPPINGS ON THE CAKE?
       - WHEN WE HAD OUR
     PICTURE TAKEN WITH IT,

     WE BIT THE HEADS OFF.
         WE WERE LIKE,
 WELL, LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.
           WE DIDN'T
    WANT ANY EVIDENCE, SO...

 - WHAT DID YOU SAY, CHRISTINA?
    - JUST 'CAUSE WE ON TV--
        KNOW THE TRUTH!
    - MAID OF HONOR SPEECH.
         REMEMBER THAT?

    - OH, SHE WAS HORRIBLE.
     IT WAS THE WORST EVER.
        - DID SHE SAY--
       - WELL, YOU KNOW.

       - NOW, WHY ARE YOU
    TALKING ABOUT THE CAKE?
           WE ATE IT.
 - THAT'S TRUE. IT TASTED GOOD.
       - AND THAT SPEECH
   DIDN'T TASTE GOOD, DID IT?

             YEAH.
         - CAN THIS END
    ON A MORE POSITIVE NOTE?
          - OF COURSE.
        GOOD JOB, BABY.

     - THERE YOU GO, GIRL.
            [laughs]
           I LOVE IT!
  YOUR SMILE SAID EVERYTHING,
    AND YOUR BODY LANGUAGE--

       I FEEL BAD FOR YOU
       WHEN YOU GET HOME.
           ALL RIGHT.
    NEXT QUESTION, COUPLES.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

       THIS NEXT QUESTION
       IS BROUGHT TO YOU
       BY THE FIT EXPERTS
        AT PLAYTEX BRAS.
WHERE DID YOUR WIFE SAY THE TWO
    OF YOU ARE MOST IN SYNC?

        IN THE KITCHEN,
      ON THE DANCE FLOOR,
       OR IN THE BEDROOM?
             CHAD?
  - WE DO WELL IN THE KITCHEN,
      DON'T GET ME WRONG.

           - MM-HMM.
- BUT THE BEDROOM, BOY, THERE'S
  SOME SPICING GOING ON THERE.
    - YEAH I SEE THAT SMILE.
     PEP, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        IN THE BEDROOM.
           ALL RIGHT,
   WE'RE GONNA GO TO STEVEN.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - OBVIOUSLY NOT WORST ENOUGH
    FOR YOU TO GET IT RIGHT!
 - STRAIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING,
WE ALL KNEW THAT I CAN'T DANCE.
    AND I CAN'T COOK EITHER,
   SO THERE'S ONLY ONE LEFT.

     THAT WOULD BE BEDROOM.
- WELL, WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY?
        IN THE BEDROOM.
       - GOOD JOB, BABY.
- SO DO YOU KEEP A SMILE ON YOUR
  WIFE'S FACE IN THAT BEDROOM?

     - IT'S THE ONLY THING
           I CAN DO.
      - ALL RIGHT, SHRAF.
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
         - NOTHING GETS
     BURNT IN THE KITCHEN,

AND THE DANCE FLOOR GETS PULLED
    OUT EVERY NOW AND THEN,
  BUT DEFINITELY THE BEDROOM.
       - IN THE BEDROOM.
         NOW, EVERYBODY
      PICKED THE BEDROOM.

     NOBODY HAS A TINGLING
 TO DO ANYTHING IN THE KITCHEN?
       - WE'RE NEWLYWEDS,
 THAT'S ALL WE GOT TIME TO DO.
           - [laughs]

 SO YOU SAY THE BEDROOM, SHRAF.
             - YES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  AND WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY?
        IN THE BEDROOM.
         - THE BEDROOM.

All work and no play...

her favorite part of the day.

That's why there's new
Beneful Baked Delights.
From crispy crackers
to shortbread cookie dog snacks,
they're oven-baked
to surprise and delight.

Beneful Baked Delights:
A unique collection
of four new snacks...
to help spark play in your day.

      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,
  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.

 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,

BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)

    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,
      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.

 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.
   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING

AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK

     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,
    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,

OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.
    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,

     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,
    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.

  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.
  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.

HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.
 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.

         EAT GOOD FATS.
           AVOID BAD.
     DON'T GO OVER 2000...

      1200 CALORIES A DAY.
 CARBS ARE BAD. CARBS ARE GOOD.
   THE STORY KEEPS CHANGING.

    SO I'M NOT LISTENING...
     TO ANYONE BUT MYSELF.
    I KNOW BETTER NUTRITION
    WHEN I SEE IT:

         GREAT GRAINS.
   GREAT GRAINS CEREAL STARTS
   WHOLE AND STAYS WHOLE.
         SEE THE SEAM?

  MORE PROCESSED FLAKES LOOK
  NOTHING LIKE NATURAL GRAINS.
     YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH
     NUTRITION YOU CAN SEE.
         GREAT GRAINS.

     AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.
