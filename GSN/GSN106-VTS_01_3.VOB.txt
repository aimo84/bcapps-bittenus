     YOU WOULDN'T WANT YOUR
     DOCTOR DOING YOUR JOB.

   SO WHY ARE YOU DOING HERS?
 ONLY YOUR DOCTOR CAN DETERMINE
 IF YOUR PERSISTENT HEARTBURN
     IS ACTUALLY SOMETHING
     MORE SERIOUS...

   LIKE ACID REFLUX DISEASE.
       OVER TIME, STOMACH
       ACID CAN DAMAGE
 THE LINING OF YOUR ESOPHAGUS.

 FOR MANY, PRESCRIPTION NEXIUM
   NOT ONLY PROVIDES 24-HOUR
   HEARTBURN RELIEF,
    BUT CAN ALSO HELP HEAL
    ACID RELATED EROSIONS IN

 THE LINING OF YOUR ESOPHAGUS.
 TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT THE
 RISK FOR OSTEOPOROSIS-RELATED
      BONE FRACTURES AND
      LOW MAGNESIUM LEVELS

 WITH LONG-TERM USE OF NEXIUM.
     POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
     INCLUDE HEADACHE,
  DIARRHEA AND ABDOMINAL PAIN.

  OTHER SERIOUS STOMACH
  CONDITIONS MAY STILL EXIST.
  LET YOUR DOCTOR DO HER JOB,
  AND YOU DO YOURS.
ASK IF NEXIUM IS RIGHT FOR YOU.

      IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD
      YOUR MEDICATION,
        ASTRAZENECA MAY
        BE ABLE TO HELP.
