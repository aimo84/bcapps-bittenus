BUT IT'S STILL ANYBODY'S GAME,
SO DON'T GO AWAY, FOLKS.

WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK
        I've worked hard
       to build my family.
  And also to build my career.

 So I'm not about to always let
   my frequent bladder urges,
      or the worry my pipes
    might leak get in the way
     of my busy lifestyle.

     That's why I take care,
         with VESIcare.
  Once-daily VESIcare can help
   control your bladder muscle
     and is proven to treat
       overactive bladder

        with symptoms of
    frequent urges and leaks
         day and night.
 If you have certain stomach or
       glaucoma problems,

      or trouble emptying
         your bladder,
     do not take VESIcare.
   VESIcare may cause allergic
 reactions that may be serious.

  If you experience swelling of
         the face, lips,
        throat or tongue,
      stop taking VESIcare
     and get emergency help.

 Tell your doctor right away if
 you have severe abdominal pain,
 or become constipated for three
          or more days.
          VESIcare may
      cause blurred vision,

  so use caution while driving
     or doing unsafe tasks.
       Common side effects
  are dry mouth, constipation,
        and indigestion.

        I've worked hard
     to get to where I am...
       and I've got better
          places to go
           than always
     going to the bathroom.

 So take charge of your symptoms
    by talking to your doctor
     and go to vesicare.com
     for a free trial offer.
