       - READY OR NOT...
          - ALL RIGHT,

  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
        ON MY HUSBAND'S
      SEXUAL REPORT CARD,
        HE'D GET AN "A"
     WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK

          BUT HE'D GET
     A "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT"
    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
              JOE.

      - UH, I GUESS, UH...
         "SEX" WOULD BE
         THE FIRST ONE.
  - "A" WHEN IT COMES TO SEX.
            - "A"--

   "A" WHEN IT COMES TO SEX,
      AND THEN "FOREPLAY."
  - YOU NEED IMPROVEMENT ON...
    - I NEED TO IMPROVE ON F--
      I JUST GO FOR THE GOAL.

           [laughter]
          - ALL RIGHT.
     NANCY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       AN "A" FOR GETTING
           IN THE MOOD,

       AND YOU DON'T NEED
    IMPROVEMENT ON ANYTHING.
           [cheering]
      - SHE'S DELUSIONAL.

        - I'M SO SORRY.
     - YOU ALWAYS GIVE ME
  NICE BACK RUBS, AND IT'S...
    OKAY. THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

     - I'M SO SORRY, GUYS.
             OKAY.
 WE'RE GONNA GO TO YOU, JAMES.

     - I'LL GO WITH AN "A"
         FOR TECHNIQUE,
             AND...
           [laughter]

    THAT'S--THAT'S NOT GOOD.
             OKAY.
           [laughter]

     I PROBABLY CAN'T TAKE
       THAT BACK, CAN I?
             - NO.
 - AND THEN "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT"
         ON FREQUENCY.
            - OKAY.

     KELLY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      AN "A" FOR FOREPLAY,
    AND "NEEDS IMPROVEMENT"
   ON FREQUENCY, SO YOU GOT--

        - THAT WAS GOOD!
     - YOU GOT HALF RIGHT!
       [cheers, applause]
      YOU ARE IN THE LEAD!

      ALL RIGHT, SHANNON,
         YOU ONLY HAVE
      TO GET ONE CORRECT.
         - I WOULD SAY
   I WORUBBING HER FEET.R...

        OKAY, AND I WOULD
      "NEED IMPROVEMENT"--
      I DON'T THINK I NEED
    IMPROVEMENT ON ANYTHING.
          - ALL RIGHT.
      - SO NO IMPROVEMENT.

           - CIEMONE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       RUBBING YOUR FEET
          AND NOTHING!
     YOU GOT IT ALL RIGHT!

           GENTLEMEN,
       HOW ARE YOU DOING?
            - GREAT.
- VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE
   SENT YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE

      SO WE COULD ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
    LET'S GET RIGHT INTO IT.
         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.
         - HERE WE GO.

    A MAN WALKS BY YOUR WIFE
     AND SAYS, "NICE PAIR."
         IS HE TALKING
        ABOUT HER EYES,
           HER LEGS,
         OR HER BOOBS?

            - WHOO.
            - TREY.
      - I'D HAVE TO SAY--
  SHE WORKED AT HOOTERS ONCE,

           SO, UH...
            - NICE.
  - I'D HAVE TO SAY HER BOOBS.
          - HER BOOBS.
            - YEAH.

        - OKAY. MICHAEL.
  - I'D ALSO HAVE TO SAY BOOBS
            AS WELL.
        I-I DON'T KNOW.
 WHO SAYS, "NICE PAIR OF SHOES"

      WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING
           AT A GIRL?
           - GREGORY.
    - IT WOULD BE HER LEGS.
          - HER LEGS.

   - SHE JUST GOT THESE, UH,
    NEW TIGHT LEATHER PANTS,
      AND SHE GOES, "BOY,
    THESE SHOW OFF MY LEGS."
     - ALL RIGHT. HER LEGS.

      ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
         MY DOCTOR SAID
       I HAVE A CONDITION

   CALLED SELECTIVE HEARING,
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY WHEN MY WIFE
       TALKS ABOUT BLANK,
       IT GOES IN ONE EAR
       AND OUT THE OTHER.

            MICHAEL.
   - I'LL GO WITH CLEANING UP
         MY, UH, MESS.
    EVERY TIME I COME HOME,
    I JUST THROW EVERYTHING

RIGHT ON THE SIDE OF THE BED...
         I DON'T KNOW--
  I'M GONNA WEAR IT THE NEXT--
LIKE, ESPECIALLY IF IT'S JUNKY,
 I'M GONNA WEAR IT THE NEXT DAY

    TO WAKE UP WITH OUR SON
          OR WHATNOT.
     - SO WHY NOT THROW IT
         ON THE FLOOR?
    - EXACTLY. WHY FOLD IT?
    AND THEN IN THE MORNING,

     I'M GONNA HAVE TO UN--
     YOU KNOW, GET IT ALL--
    IT'S RIGHT THERE, NEAT.
  I KNOW SHE HATES IT, THOUGH.
        - OKAY. GREGORY.

     - IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
    CLEANING UP THE KITCHEN.
            - YEAH?
  - YEAH, I DON'T CLEAN IT UP.
           [laughter]
       - YOU JUST DON'T.

  - I DO AFTER DINNER. THAT'S
 THE ONLY TIME, BUT OTHERWISE,
    THE SINK JUST BUILDS UP,
      AND THEN I WASH 'EM.
            - TREY.

 - UM, MINE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE
         COMMUNICATION.
    YOU KNOW, SHE'S ALWAYS--
  "HEY, TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS.
           TALK TO ME
     ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS."

  I DON'T REALLY WANT TO TALK,
           YOU KNOW?
           [laughter]
   I'D RATHER PLAY MY GUITAR
    OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

  - OKAY. NOW A QUESTION FROM
  ASHLEY FURNITURE HOME STORE,
       WHERE GREAT STYLE
 DOESN'T HAVE TO BE EXPENSIVE.
   TELL ME, GUYS, WHICH PIECE
   OF FURNITURE IN YOUR HOME

         MOST RESEMBLES
      YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW.
      [scattered laughter]
            GREGORY.
        - THAT WOULD BE
       OUR OLD RECLINER,

      'CAUSE IT'S KIND OF
        OLD AND RAGGEDY.
         [audience ohs]
           [applause]

    DANGEROUSLY, DON'T YOU?

        - OKAY. MICHAEL.
- OUR BEDROOM SET--OUR BEDROOM.
      - YOUR BEDROOM SET.
        - YEAH, THE BED.
  WE'LL GO WITH JUST THE BED.

             - WHY?
   - 'CAUSE MY MOTHER-IN-LAW
   IS VERY WARM AND SWEET...
            - OKAY.
  - AND MY BED KEEPS ME WARM,

      AND IT'S NOT SWEET,
         BUT I LIKE IT.
             UM...

   ACCORDING TO YOUR HUSBAND,
      IS THIS MAN TALKING
  ABOUT YOUR EYES, YOUR LEGS,
         OR YOUR BOOBS?

             MANDY.
    - UM, I'LL SAY MY LEGS.

      YOU GOT GREAT LEGS.

  - YEAH, 'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE
TO WEAR, LIKE, SHORTS OR SKIRTS,
         SHOW 'EM OFF--
    I WORK OUT A LOT, SO...
    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, TREY?
          - HER BOOBS.

         - YOUR BOOBS.
            - WHAT?
  - OH. YOU WORKED AT HOOTERS.
      - OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
           [laughter]

    BUT I WORE SHORT SHORTS
AT HOOTERS TO SHOW OFF MY LEGS.
   - WELL, I MEAN, EVERYTHING
 ABOUT YOU IS, YOU KNOW, GREAT.
           - THANKS.
            - YEAH.

           ALL RIGHT.
     LANIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - OH, DEFINITELY MY BOOBS...
            - YEAH?
          - BECAUSE--
   LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

       I SPEND A GOOD $80
     AT VICTORIA'S SECRET--
            "GIVE ME
     THE BIGGEST GEL BRA."
      AND I--THEN YOU ADD
    THE CHICKEN CUTLETS IN,

            SO, UH--
- [laughing] AND THEY OUT THERE.
      - THAT'S ALL YOU SEE
         IS THE BOOBS.
  - WHAT DID YOU SAY, MICHAEL?
       - COME ON--BOOBS.

            - YEAH!
             - YAY!
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
          OKAY. TAMIE.

  - UM, HE'S GONNA SAY BOOBS,
       BECAUSE HE ALWAYS
     TELLS ME, "NICE RACK."
             - OH.

      ALL RIGHT, GREGORY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      HIS SAID YOUR LEGS.

           [laughter]
          - OH, GREG!
        - IN THIS CASE,
     NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER.

           ALL RIGHT.
    LADIES, NEXT QUESTION--
 HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND COMPLETE
         THIS SENTENCE?

         MY DOCTOR SAID
       I HAVE A CONDITION
   CALLED SELECTIVE HEARING,
WHICH EXPLAINS WHY WHEN MY WIFE
       TALKS ABOUT BLANK,

       IT GOES IN ONE EAR
   AND OUT THE OTHER. LANIE.

    OF HOUSEWORK OR CHORES.
   - WHAT'D YOU SAY, MICHAEL?

             - YAY!
          - ALL RIGHT.
 - YOU'RE GETTIN' SOME TONIGHT.

           [laughing]
    - TAMIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - THE JOB THAT I HATE DOING
          MOST OF ALL

IS CLEANING OUT THE, UH, TOILETS
  WITH THE HARD-WATER STAINS,
      SO THAT'S HIS CHORE,
    AND HE ALWAYS SOMETIMES
       FORGETS TO DO IT.

       - WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      HE SAYS CLEANING UP
          THE KITCHEN.
             - OH.
           - WELL...

    ON THE GAME, AREN'T WE?
           [laughter]

       ALL RIGHT, MANDY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - UM, I WOULD SAY
        HOUSEWORK, TOO.
            - OKAY.

 - COMMUNICATION, RIGHT THERE.
        - I DON'T KNOW.
           - COME ON.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.

  ASHLEY FURNITURE HOME STORE.
   ACCORDING TO YOUR HUSBAND,

    WHICH PIECE OF FURNITURE
          IN YOUR HOME
     MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLES
          YOUR MOTHER?
             TAMIE.

         - DINETTE SET.
      - DINETTE SET. WHY?
- DINETTE SET, BECAUSE IT'S REAL
     DAINTY, AND IT'S NICE,
  AND IT'S REALLY GIRLIE-GIRL.
           - MM-HMM.

 - AND MY MOM IS A GIRLIE GIRL.
   - GREGORY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     HE SAID OLD RECLINER.
             - OH!

           OH, I HOPE
    SHE AIN'T WATCHIN' THIS!
           [laughing]
            OH, NO.
          - CAN YOU--

     YOU WANT TO TELL TAMIE
 WHY YOU SAID THE OLD RECLINER?
       - IT'S KIND OF OLD
          AND RAGGEDY.
         - OH, OH, OH!

            - OKAY.
     MANDY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - UH, OUR COMPUTER DESK?
     - YOUR COMPUTER DESK.
     WHY THE COMPUTER DESK?
         - I WOULD SAY
       THE COMPUTER DESK,

   JUST 'CAUSE SHE'S STURDY.
    - GOT YOU. THAT'S SWEET.
ALL RIGHT, TREY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        COMPUTER CHAIR.
          - THE CHAIR.
  - OH, I WAS GONNA SAY THAT!

        - YOU SHOULD'VE.
          OH, COME ON.
         - OKAY, LANIE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- HOPEFULLY THIS IS EASY, 'CAUSE
 WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF MOVING,

  AND WE THREW EVERYTHING OUT
        BUT ONE THING--
     I HAVE A BEDROOM SET.
   BUT I WILL SAY, THAT DOES
      RESEMBLE MY MOTHER,

 BECAUSE IT'S CLEAN, IT'S NICE,
  IT'S FRESH, IT'S--YOU KNOW.
AND THAT'S MY MOTHER, YOU KNOW,
     SWEET AND CLEAN AND...
            - OKAY.
         - STREAMLINED.

   - ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID YOU
         SAY, MICHAEL?

   MORE OFTEN IN THE BEDROOM
       IN THE LAST WEEK--
       THE SNOOZE BUTTON,
THE POWER BUTTON ON HIS LAPTOP,
        OR YOUR BUTTON?

             MANDY.
         - I WOULD SAY
      MY BUTTON, FOR SURE.
         - OKAY. LANIE.

   - IT'S GOTTA BE MY BUTTON.
 I DON'T NEED TO HIT THE SNOOZE
ANYMORE--I HAVE A ONE-YEAR-OLD.
            - OKAY.
     TAMIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

            - HE HIT
   THE SNOOZE BUTTON, LADIES.
           - HE DID?
     - YES, IT WAS SNOOZE.
           [laughter]

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
   THIS IS OUR NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
    HE MAY ACT LIKE THE BIG,
       STRONG PROTECTOR,

    BUT MY HUSBAND WOULD BE
     AS HELPLESS AS A CHILD
     IF I DIDN'T TAKE CARE
         OF THE BLANK.
             LANIE.
    - OH, GOD, THE COOKING.

            - YEAH?
    - HE'D STARVE TO DEATH.
         - OKAY. TAMIE.
           - ONE UP--
    HE CAN'T EVEN FRY BACON.

           [laughter]

     LIKE, HE COOKS FOR ME
  SOMETIMES, BUT HE DOESN'T--
   IF WE RUN OUT OF SOMETHING
        AND HE NEEDS IT,
  HE'LL JUST EAT WHATEVER ELSE
          IS IN THERE,

    EVEN IF IT'S JUST, LIKE,
     SLICED HAM OR TURKEY.
            - YEAH.
    - LIKE, HE'LL EAT THAT,
      AND HE WON'T TELL ME
    THAT WE'RE OUT OF YOGURT

   OR SOMETHING THAT WE NEED,
SO I WOULD SAY GROCERY SHOPPING.

            - WHOO!
 - BUT DON'T WORRY, EVERYBODY,

       WE STILL GOT A LOT
      OF QUESTIONS TO GO.
        HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
   GENTLEMEN, WHICH OF THESE
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY

     YOU PUSHED MORE OFTEN
         IN THE BEDROOM
       IN THE LAST WEEK--
       THE SNOOZE BUTTON,

        THE POWER BUTTON
        ON YOUR LAPTOP,
     OR YOUR WIFE'S BUTTON?
             TREY.

         - UH, PROBABLY
       THE SNOOZE BUTTON.
    YEAH, I'D PROBABLY GO--
 THAT'S PROBABLY THE BEST ONE.
         I DON'T KNOW.
      I'M NOT REALLY SURE.

         - OKAY, MANDY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           MY BUTTON.
             - OH.
         - BABE, WHAT?
          - I MEAN...

 - BUT, LIKE, LAST NIGHT AND...
         - OKAY, YEAH.

        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - THAT'S AN EASY ONE--
    DEFINITELY HER BUTTON...

            - YEAH?
        - ALL DAY LONG.
            - OKAY.
     LANIE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

         - HER BUTTON?
            - YEAH.
     - YOU KNOW YOU LYIN'.
      - THE SNOOZE BUTTON.

   - YOU'VE BEEN HITTING THAT
 SNOOZE BUTTON ALL--EVERY DAY,
 'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN GETTING UP,
         GOING TO WORK,
         TALKING ABOUT,
     WE GONNA GO ON VACAY.

      - WE'RE ON VACATION.
 WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER MORNIN'?
   - YOU BETTER START TELLING
     THE TRUTH. YOU KNOW--
      - THAT'S THE TRUTH.
   - WE DON'T HAVE NO POINTS.

           [laughter]
           NO POINTS!
           [applause]
        - OH, HUSBANDS,
   HERE'S THE NEXT QUESTION.

       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    HE MAY ACT LIKE THE BIG,
       STRONG PROTECTOR,
    BUT MY HUSBAND WOULD BE
     AS HELPLESS AS A CHILD

     IF I DIDN'T TAKE CARE
           OF BLANK.
            MICHAEL.
   - I'LL GO WITH EVERYTHING.

       UM, SHE'S REALLY--
   SHE'S REALLY LIKE MY ROCK.
     SHE HELPS ME OUT WITH
EVERYTHING. EVERYTHING I NEED--
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK,
       IT'S ALREADY DONE.

     SHE'S--SHE'S THE BEST,
    AND THAT'S WHY I THINK--
       IT MIGHT BE WRONG,
  BUT I'LL GO WITH EVERYTHING.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, LANIE?

   - WELL, I KIND OF NARROWED
      IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT
     AND WENT WITH COOKING.
         - OH, COOKING.
      - COOKING. GREGORY.

 - I LIKE THAT COOKING ANSWER.
 - YOU LIKE THE COOKING ANSWER?

      - TAMIE IS SO HAPPY.
     - OH, THANK YOU, GOD.
   YOU KNOW WE WAS GONNA HAVE
        A BAD RIDE HOME.

          - ALL RIGHT,
     TREY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - UM, I THINK THIS WAY EASY.
         I HOPE IT IS.
       UM, IT'S MY FACE,

BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS--SHE'S ALWAYS
     PLUCKING MY EYEBROWS,
  AND SHE BUYS ME ACNE LOTION.
    - MANDY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       GROCERY SHOPPING.
             - OH.
   - BUT HE'S--THAT'S RIGHT.
            - YEAH.

AND THIS ONE, BUT THAT'S RIGHT.

    IS A TEN-STORY BUILDING
         WITH HER FEET

       IS YOUR FAVORITE?
            GREGORY.
 - UH, THE--THE SEVENTH FLOOR.
      - THE SEVENTH FLOOR.

         - THAT'S ABOUT
    WHERE THE NICE RACK IS.
            - OKAY.

   SHE'S GOT THOSE LONG LEGS,
    YOU KNOW, AND SO RIGHT--
THOSE ARE LIKE ONE THROUGH FOUR.
           - UH-HUH.

 'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE HER BUTT.

          - ALL RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
  - FIFTH FLOOR. MANDY, WHAT'D
   YOU SAY? THE EIGHTH FLOOR.

        DOWN LOW AND...

        - SO YOU SAID--
      YOU SAID FLOOR FIVE?
  - LET ME THINK FOR A SECOND,
 'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE UPSTAIRS,
     AND DOWNSTAIRS IS FUN
        TO HANG AROUND.

         I'LL GO WITH--
         I GUESS, LIKE,
   FOUR OR FIVE, YOU KNOW...
       - YOU--WHICH ONE?
         YOU NEED ONE.

      - FIVE--FLOOR FIVE.
