    MY SON, ADEN, HAS ASTHMA.

TO PASS A GAS SOLUTION.

I REMEMBER THE DAYS BEFORE COPD.
          MY SON AND I
    NEVER MISSED OPENING DAY.

          BUT WITH COPD
   MAKING IT HARD TO BREATHE,
            I THOUGHT
    THOSE DAYS MIGHT BE OVER.
     SO MY DOCTOR PRESCRIBED
           SYMBICORT.

 IT HELPS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE
        MY LUNG FUNCTION,
   STARTING WITHIN 5 MINUTES.
    SYMBICORT DOESN'T REPLACE
        A RESCUE INHALER

      FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.
         WITH SYMBICORT,
   TODAY I'M BREATHING BETTER,
        AND THAT MEANS...

      GAME ON!
     SYMBICORT IS FOR COPD,
  INCLUDING CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
         AND EMPHYSEMA.

     IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN
     MORE THAN TWICE A DAY.
     SYMBICORT MAY INCREASE
  YOUR RISK OF LUNG INFECTIONS,
          OSTEOPOROSIS,
     AND SOME EYE PROBLEMS.

        TELL YOUR DOCTOR
  IF YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION
     OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
        BEFORE TAKING IT.
                 [ whistle ]

           WITH COPD,
   I THOUGHT I MIGHT MISS OUT
    ON MY FAVORITE TRADITION.
   NOW SYMBICORT SIGNIFICANTLY
   IMPROVES MY LUNG FUNCTION,

   STARTING WITHIN 5 MINUTES.
   AND THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
        IN MY BREATHING.
         TODAY I'M BACK
     WITH MY FAVORITE TEAM.

        ASK YOUR DOCTOR
        ABOUT SYMBICORT.
