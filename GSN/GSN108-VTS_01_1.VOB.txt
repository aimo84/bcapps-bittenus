SO, CAN WE JUST PUT THAT DOWN?
  AN "A" FOR EFFORT!
  BUT, YES, SHE WAS
READING OFF THE CARDS TO ME

AND TRYING TO QUIZ ME.
           ALL RIGHT, WELL,
      YOU GET AN "A" FOR EFFORT.
    NOW, TELL EVERYBODY ABOUT
 THE CHARITY YOU'RE PLAYING FOR.

    I AM DONATING
 ALL OF THE PROCEEDS
TO THE AMERICAN RED CROSS
AND ALSO TO AN ORGANIZATION
THAT HELPS GRANDPARENTS THAT
ARE RAISING THEIR GRANDKIDS,

  BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
MY GRANDPARENTS RAISED ME,
AND I KNOW WHAT A BIG STRUGGLE
   IT WAS FOR THEM,
SO I KIND OF WANT TO GIVE BACK
TO THEM, TOO, SO, YOU KNOW.

         DO YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
           THE VERY FIRST NIGHT
                I EVER SAW YOU
             ON "AMERICAN IDOL,"
                 AND YOU WERE
             WITH YOUR GRANDDAD,

       'CAUSE I LOVE MY GRANDDAD
                SO MUCH,
AND YOU COULD JUST TELL HOW MUCH
