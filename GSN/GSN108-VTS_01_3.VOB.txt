     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

         YAY.
            LET ME ASK YOU THIS
  BEFORE WE GET TO THE QUESTION.
 OKAY.
 WHAT WAS YOUR MOST EMBARRASSING
        MOMENT IN SCHOOL?

WHEN I WAS IN 2nd GRADE,
LIKE, I CUT THE CHEESE IN CLASS,
AND, LIKE, IT WASN'T ONE
 THAT YOU COULD HIDE.
         WAS IT A COOKING CLASS,
               I'M HOPING?

NO, IT WAS NOT COOKING.
                             NO.
SO, EVERYBODY POINTED
AND LAUGHED, AND I...
                 DID YOU CRY?

    MAYBE.
                      MAYBE.
        MAYBE.
            WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
                  ANYTHING

         TO BE EMBARRASSED ABOUT
              TODAY, KELLIE.
     SO, PICK ANOTHER CLASSMATE.
      ALL RIGHT.

       OLIVIA!
        OLIVIA, COME ON UP HERE.
         YAY!

                    WHOO!
        ALL RIGHT, OLIVIA,
 IF YOU HAD TO HELP MISS PICKLER
        WITH TWO SUBJECTS,

    WHICH ONES WOULD THEY BE?
         MUSIC, WORLD GEOGRAPHY,
              AND SPELLING.
        OKAY.

MAYBE WE SHOULD GO BACK
     TO 1st GRADE
AND FINISH WHAT WE STARTED.
LET'S GO 1st GRADE SPELLING,
       PLEASE.

I'M GETTING SWEATY AGAIN.
    THE $5,000 QUESTION IS...

     DO YOU KNOW THE ANSWER?
           [ LAUGHTER ]
 IT'S NOT IN "WORD."

  NO, THE WORD IS "WATERMELON."
OH, I WAS LIKE, "THERE'S NOT
AN 'E' IN WORD, SO"...
 "HOW MANY TIMES DOES THE LETTER
  'E' APPEAR IN 'WATERMELON'?"
WATERMELON.

I NEED A PIECE OF PAPER.
       OLIVIA HAS LOCKED IN
           HER ANSWER.
"W-A-T-E" -- THAT'S ONE.
    "R" -- WATER.

THAT'S A COMPOUND WORD.
  AND THEN "MELON."
     "M-E-L-O-N"?
TWO -- WATER...MELON.

THEY'RE MIGHT BE TWO L's,
BUT WE AIN'T COUNTING THE L's.
          JUST THE E's.
       TWO E's.

      OH, GOSH.
     [ SHUDDERS ]
        YEAH?
    IS THAT RIGHT?

     AM I RIGHT?
         "HOW MANY TIMES
    DOES THE LETTER 'E' APPEAR
     IN THE FOLLOWING WORD?"

    THE WORD WAS "WATERMELON."
         YOU SAID, "TWO."
     YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
         YOU GOT $5,000.
      ALL RIGHT!

      I THOUGHT
  I WAS GOING HOME!
    NO, YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME.
       WE'RE WINNING MONEY.
AND IT ONLY HAS ONE "L."

 YEAH, YOU WERE EXACTLY RIGHT --
       RIGHT ON THE MONEY.
 I FEEL REALLY SMART
      RIGHT NOW.
   ISN'T THAT A GOOD FEELING?
I DO, YES.

    NOW, FROM "AMERICAN IDOL,"
         WE LEARNED A LOT
 ABOUT YOUR HOMETOWN, ALBEMARLE.
      VERY NICE.
 THERE YOU GO. YEAH.

    ALBEMARLE, NORTH CAROLINA.
         HOW ABOUT THAT?
        AND I JUST THOUGHT
          IT WAS SO COOL
   THE WAY THE WHOLE TOWN WAS
 BEHIND YOU ON "AMERICAN IDOL."
THEY ARE. THEY ARE.

        WELL, GUESS WHAT?
YEAH?
NOT ONLY WERE THEY BEHIND YOU
ON "AMERICAN IDOL,"
THEY ARE BEHIND YOU TONIGHT,

BECAUSE WE HAVE A MESSAGE
FROM THE MAYOR.
     OH! REALLY?
           TAKE A LOOK.

            <i>HI, KELLIE.</i>
       <i>THIS IS MAYOR WHITLEY</i>
         <i>OF YOUR HOMETOWN,</i>
     <i>ALBEMARLE, NORTH CAROLINA.</i>

    <i>WE'RE SO VERY PROUD OF YOU.</i>
    <i>WE KNOW THAT YOU DID NOT WIN</i>
      <i>ON THE "AMERICAN IDOL,"</i>
      <i>BUT WE SINCERELY HOPE</i>
      <i>THAT YOU PROVE THAT...</i>

OH, THERE'S MY BROTHER.
      IS THAT YOUR BROTHER?
YES.

       OH, THAT'S SO COOL!
      BUT IT'S YOUR HOMETOWN
     THAT ALWAYS MAKES YOU --
  IT DOES. IT DOES.

         YOU GOT $5,000.
    LET'S DOUBLE IT RIGHT NOW.
      PICK ANOTHER SUBJECT.
        OKAY.

 LET'S DO MUSIC THEN.

    THE $10,000 QUESTION IS...

      IT'S A CLASSROOM CLUB
            QUESTION.
      OH, GOSH.
     YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS.

  THIS MEANS THAT THIS QUESTION
        WAS SENT IN TO US
      BY AN ACTUAL VIEWER --
       IN THIS CASE MORGAN
     FROM HERITAGE SCHOOL --

  AND BECAUSE WE ELECTED TO USE
        MORGAN'S QUESTION,
         "ARE YOU SMARTER
       THAN A 5th GRADER?"
       IS GIVING HER SCHOOL

GREAT!
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION,
MORGAN.
NOW EVERYBODY'S GONNA EXPECT ME
TO GET THIS QUESTION RIGHT,

    'CAUSE I SING.
        MORGAN'S QUESTION,
    WORTH $10,000, IS THIS...
      OH, GOSH.

WELL, WE KNOW ABOUT WIND.
      LET'S SEE.
           [ LAUGHTER ]

        OLIVIA'S LOCKED IN
             ALREADY.
   BETTER THIS END
THAN THE OTHER, RIGHT?
   OKAY, LET'S SEE.

 [ Chuckling ] "THE PICCOLO IS
A MEMBER OF WHAT MUSICAL FAMILY?
        WOODWIND, STRINGS,
         OR PERCUSSION?"
  I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

    I DON'T KNOW.
         WELL, ALL RIGHT,
       BUT LET ME TELL YOU.
      YOU'RE IN GOOD SHAPE,
     AND LET ME TELL YOU WHY.

I'M GONNA GET A SWIRLY
     AFTER CLASS.
    YOU'RE GONNA GET A SWIRLY?
YOU NEVER HAD A SWIRLY?

         WHAT'S A SWIRLY?
IT'S WHERE THEY TAKE YOU
   IN THE BATHROOM
AND THEY DIP YOUR HEAD
   IN THE COMMODE.

   THEY HOLD YOU UP
    BY YOUR LEGS,
   IN THE COMMODE,
  AND THEY FLUSH IT
 SO YOU GET A SWIRLY

LIKE THE MICHELIN MAN.
THAT'S WHAT THEY CALL IT.
I DIDN'T MAKE THE RULES.
     I JUST RUN.

    ALL RIGHT, LET ME TELL YOU
        THE STRATEGYERE.
          YOU HAVE BOTH
       OF YOUR CHEATS LEFT.
  DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OUT OF
THE THREE WHICH ONE IT MIGHT BE?

    I WANT TO SAY
  EITHER "B" OR "C".
PICCOLO LIKE PICKLER --
       PICCOLO.
        AND...

  PERCUSSION STARTS
     WITH A "P."
           [ LAUGHTER ]
     THIS IS NOT
  A LAUGHING MATTER!

          IT KIND OF IS.
           [ LAUGHTER ]
    I'M JUST GONNA
KEEP THE P's TOGETHER.

  I'M JUST GONNA SAY
    "PERCUSSION."
     I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S RIGHT OR NOT.
  I JUST DON'T KNOW,
BUT I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.

   OKAY, I SAID IT.
      I'M DONE.
       OH, MAN!
     IT'S WRONG!
 IS THIS BAD OR WHAT?

    I JUST -- I WANT TO TALK
    ABOUT YOUR THEORY HERE.
   YOU WENT WITH "PERCUSSION,"
        BECAUSE "PICCOLO"
         AND "PERCUSSION"

      BOTH START WITH A "P."
       OH, MAN.
       IT TOOK YOU A WHILE
          TO GET THERE,

         BUT FOR $10,000,
    "PERCUSSION" IS ABSOLUTELY
     NOT EVEN CLOSE, KELLIE.
       [ AUDIENCE GROANS ]

   A PICCOLO IS A SMALL FLUTE.
          IT IS A MEMBER
     OF THE WOODWIND FAMILY.
         SO, HERE'S WHERE
        WE STAND, KELLIE.

     IF SHE SAID, "WOODWIND,"
   YOUR CHARITY'S GOT $10,000.
          IF SHE DIDN'T,
        THEY HAVE NOTHING.
       NOTHING?

         MAN!
    TAKE A LOOK AT THE BOARD.
         OLIVIA SAID...
I'M SCARED.

"WOODWIND"!
YOU GOT $10,000!
THERE IT IS RIGHT THERE.
WE'RE GONNA BE PLAYING
FOR $25,000 RIGHT AFTER THIS.
