          - ALL RIGHT,
THE WIVES ARE BACK AND, LADIES,
  WHILE YOU WERE GONE, I ASKED
 YOUR HUSBANDS THREE QUESTIONS
AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY AND
      MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

  EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS WORTH
  FIVE POINTS, SO HERE WE GO.
       YOU READY, LADIES?
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.

          IF THERE WAS
      AN AUDIENCE PRESENT
   DURING YOUR LAST SEX ROMP,
     WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY

      WOULD HAVE OCCURRED?
      A BURST OF LAUGHTER,
       A COLLECTIVE GASP,
     OR A STANDING OVATION?

            HOLLIE?
     - A STANDING OVATION,
       BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
      YOU GOT TO SAY THAT
      ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND,

     BUT HE'S ALWAYS GOOD.
           [laughter]
    - SO YOU GOT TO SAY IT?
        DO YOU MEAN IT?
          - OF COURSE!
             YEAH.

          - ALL RIGHT.
             OKAY.
           JONATHAN?
      A BURST OF LAUGHTER.

          - OH, WHAT?
         - I'M A CLOWN.
 - I KNOW, BUT NOT IN THE BED.

          - THANK YOU.
   - YOU DIDN'T TELL US THAT.
 YOU'RE NOT A CLOWN IN THE BED.
        - WELL, THANKS.
       I APPRECIATE THAT.

             - UGH.
           - OH, NO.
     - ALL RIGHT, ADRIANNA?
- DEFINITELY A STANDING OVATION.

       IT WAS A GOOD ONE.
            - YEAH?
           - IT WAS.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    DON, WAS IT A GOOD ONE?

   IT WAS A STANDING OVATION.
            - YEAH!
            - NICE.
            - YEAH.
           [applause]

            JILLIAN?
     - A STANDING OVATION.
     - A STANDING OVATION?
          - OH, YEAH.

 WE MAKE MAGIC IN THE BEDROOM.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       ALL RIGHT, JARED?

    GOT A STANDING OVATION.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
           [applause]
          - GOOD JOB.

          - I LOVE IT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

      WHEN I ASKED MY WIFE
          TO MARRY ME,
      THE VERY FIRST THING
           SHE DID--
   AND I MEAN THE VERY FIRST
      THING--WAS "BLANK."

           ADRIANNA?
          - I PAUSED.
        I MADE HIM WAIT
    FOR PROBABLY 30 SECONDS

   BEFORE I GAVE HIM ANYTHING
            AT ALL.
             - AHH.
              DON?

    HE SAID YOU SAID, "YES."
           - [laughs]
             WELL--
      - WAS IT THAT QUICK?

       - AFTER THE PAUSE.
            - YEAH.
  - DO YOU REMEMBER THE PAUSE?
         - NOT REALLY.
           [laughter]

           - JILLIAN?
  - UM, I SAID, "OH, MY GOD,"
     PROBABLY 5,000 TIMES.

    - JARED, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      HE SAID YOU YELLED.
      - OH, WELL, YELLED,
         "OH, MY GOD."

        - WE'LL TAKE IT.
        WE WILL TAKE IT.
     [cheers and applause]
          YES, IT IS.

     IT'S HARD TO JUST SAY,
         "OH, MY GOD."
            HOLLIE?
        - I SAID, "YES,"
           OF COURSE,

   BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING
      ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE
 AND, UH, AFTERWARDS I REMEMBER
       GETTING VERY HOT,
   AND, UH, HE WAS ASKING ME
         IF I WAS OKAY.

     BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY
             A YES,
      BECAUSE I WAS LIKE,
          "OF COURSE."
            - OKAY.
           JONATHAN?

        LOOKED SHOCKED.
            - WHAT?
 I WAS DEFINITELY NOT SHOCKED.

  - YOU WERE TOTALLY SHOCKED.
             - AWW!
        - I'M OBVIOUSLY
      A GOOD ACTRESS THEN.

          [crowd oohs]
- YOU BEEN TAKIN' ALL KINDS OF--
              NO!

          PUT THAT ON.
       YOU KEEP THAT ON.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.

   ACCORDING TO YOUR HUSBAND,
  WHAT PRODUCT DID HE SAY YOU
   CONSIDER TO BE YOUR MVT--
    MOST VALUABLE TOILETRY?

            JILLIAN?
          - MY MAKEUP.
      - ALL RIGHT, JARED?

    HE SAID YOUR HAIR DRYER.
         - HAIR DRYER.
           - OH, OOH.
            - YEAH.
      - I COULD GO WITHOUT
        THE HAIR DRYER.

      - IT WAS A TOSS UP.
          - OOH, YEAH.
       THAT'S A BAD ONE.
            - OKAY.
            - SORRY.

           - HOLLIE?
  - FACE WIPE, BECAUSE I HAVE
     TO USE THEM EVERY DAY.
 - TO WIPE OFF THE MAKEUP, HUH?
            - YEAH.

       - THE FACE WIPES.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      HE SAID HAIR DRYER.
             - UGH!
           [giggles]

          - I'M SORRY.
         MY NAME'S JON.
         - HAIR DRYER?
           [laughter]
             - HI.
       NICE TO MEET YOU.

           [applause]
   - I DON'T USE A HAIR DRYER
           EVERY DAY!
  - ADRIANNA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

   - UH, I'M GONNA SAY SOAP.
      I WAS MY HANDS ABOUT
       1,000 TIMES A DAY.
            - OKAY.

    AND WHAT'D YOU SAY, DON?
   - I'M JUST GONNA STICK IT
       IN THE HOLE THERE.
    - UH, HE SAID HAIRBRUSH.

   - I COULDN'T THINK OF ONE.
       I COULDN'T THINK.
      THERE'S, LIKE, NINE.
       - ALL RIGHT, WELL,
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.

       JARED AND JILLIAN,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH TEN POINTS.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN

  TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AND THIS
  TIME THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED,
         SO STAY TUNED.
     [cheers and applause]

         THE KIDS LOVE.
  THE WORD "WOW" COMES TO MIND.

        ABOUT THE SPICE

  I HOPE NONE OF YOUR MOTHERS

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         TIME TO ANSWER
        A FEW QUESTIONS.
   THESE NEXT THREE ARE WORTH
        TEN POINTS EACH.

         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.
      - OKAY, HERE'S YOUR
        FIRST QUESTION.
  WAS YOUR LAST ARGUMENT MORE
  LIKE A BORDER DEBATE BETWEEN

      THE U.S. AND CANADA,
      ENGLAND AND IRELAND,
         OR NORTH KOREA
        AND SOUTH KOREA?

            HOLLIE?
         - I'D ONLY SAY
         THE SECOND ONE
    BECAUSE I'M FROM ENGLAND

  AND HE'S BEEN AN IRISH TENOR
           IN A SHOW.
            - OKAY.
          - SO, UH...
      LET'S MAKE IT A BIT
         MORE LITERAL.

    - ALL RIGHT, I HEAR YOU.
      ENGLAND AND IRELAND.
             - YES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
           ADRIANNA?

  - UM, WE DON'T REALLY ARGUE
         ALL THAT MUCH.
   I'LL SAY U.S. AND CANADA.
       - U.S. AND CANADA?
             OKAY.

            JILLIAN?
       - UM, I'D SAY U.S.
        AND CANADA TOO.
       WE'RE PRETTY EVEN
    AND IF I RAISE TOO HIGH,

    HE BRINGS ME BACK DOWN,
  SO I'D SAY U.S. AND CANADA.
            - OKAY.
          ALL RIGHTY.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.

        IN ORDER TO KEEP
       A LIFETIME OF SEX
       WITH YOUR HUSBAND
      INTERESTING FOR YOU,
      WHAT WOULD YOU WANT
 TO DO MORE OF IN THE BEDROOM?

           ADRIANNA?
   - THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT
          WE DON'T DO.
             - OH!
           - [laughs]

  - SO MANY THINGS DONE, HUH?
  - UM, WELL, HOW ABOUT THINGS
    OUTSIDE OF THE BEDROOM?
  - LIKE, WHERE WOULD YOU WANT
             TO GO?

       - ANYWHERE OUTSIDE
        OF THE BEDROOM.
        OF THE BEDROOM?
             - YES.
            - OKAY.

            JILLIAN?
     - I WOULD SAY PROBABLY
    MORE ROLE-PLAYING MAYBE.
      - WHAT KIND OF ROLES
    WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY?

        - I DON'T KNOW.
      MAYBE DOCTOR, NURSE.
           YOU KNOW,
     HE'S A POLICE OFFICER,
   SO MAYBE I'LL PLAY VICTIM.

         I DON'T KNOW.
             - OH!
              OH!
   OFFICER, IS THAT YOUR GUN?

             OKAY.
            HOLLIE?
            - UM...

    PROBABLY MORE ME ON TOP,
      BECAUSE HE NORMALLY
       LIKES TO BE THE...
 DOMINANT, MORE AGGRESSIVE ONE
      IN OUR RELATIONSHIP,

         SO THEREFORE,
      WE'LL SWITCH IT UP.
          - THE CLOWN?
        - YEAH, I KNOW.
     HARD TO BELIEVE, HUH?
             - OH.

      SO YOU WANT TO PLAY
        RIDE THE CLOWN?
    [laughter and applause]
      - WELL, WHEN YOU PUT
         IT LIKE THAT.

    - NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
  HOW OFTEN WOULD YOU SAY YOUR
   HUSBAND FINDS IT NECESSARY
    TO SPEND SOME ALONE TIME
      WITH HIS BEST FRIEND

   WHO LIVES BELOW HIS BELT?
            JILLIAN?
       - I'D SAY PROBABLY
       FIVE TIMES A WEEK.

      - FIVE TIMES A WEEK?
            - YEAH.
  - THAT SOUNDS NORMAL TO ME.
           [laughter]

            HOLLIE?
          - I'D SAY HE
        DOESN'T HAVE TO
     BECAUSE HE GETS IT ALL
            FROM ME.

          - OH, OKAY.
     [cheers and applause]
           ALL RIGHT.
           ADRIANNA?
         - MY HUSBAND'S
      LIKE A TEENAGE BOY.

           EVERY DAY.
          - EVERY DAY?
      - NO MATTER HOW MUCH
    HE'S GETTING, EVERY DAY.
     - IT'S--SO EVERY DAY?
             OKAY.

LADIES, HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.

          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE:
    THE GUEST THAT TRAVELED
          THE FURTHEST

  TO OUR WEDDING WAS "BLANK,"
  WHILE THE GUEST I WOULD HAVE
     LIKED TO SHIP FAR AWAY
    WOULD HAVE BEEN "BLANK."

            HOLLIE?
          - OUR FRIEND
      SULLY'S MOM DEBBIE,
        BECAUSE SHE CAME
   ALL THE WAY FROM ENGLAND.

  SHE DIDN'T COME SPECIFICALLY
        FOR OUR WEDDING,
 BUT SHE ENDED UP BEING THERE,
     WHICH IS REALLY NICE.
    - OH, SHE JUST HAPPENED
  TO BE, LIKE, THERE AND SHE--

 - SHE WAS JUST IN THE VICINITY
    AND THOUGHT, "WHY NOT?"
    AND THEN THE SECOND ONE
         WOULD PROBABLY
      BE OUR OTHER FRIEND,
   WHO I WON'T SAY HER NAME.

       - WHAT'S HER NAME?
   - CATHY, BECAUSE SHE JUST
    KIND OF INVITED HERSELF.
             - AHH.

    SO DEBBIE JUST HAPPENED
          TO BE THERE
   AND CATHY INVITED HERSELF?
             - YES.
       YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

  - I LOVE YOUR GUESTS, GIRL.
      ALL RIGHT, ADRIANNA?
   - UM, THE FRIEND WHO CAME
     FROM THE FARTHEST AWAY

       WAS MY FRIEND JOE.
      HE CAME FROM HAWAII.
          - ALL RIGHT.

  - AND THE ONE I WOULD RATHER
          NOT BE THERE
WAS THE ONLY KID WHO SHOWED UP.
          IT WAS, UM,
      MY DAD'S BOSS'S SON.

           - OH, MAN.
            JILLIAN?
    - UM, I'D SAY MY BROTHER
       CAME THE FURTHEST.
    HE WAS COMING FROM L.A.
 AND WE GOT MARRIED IN MEXICO.

 AND THEN, ALTHOUGH I LOVE HIM,
    UH, JARED'S COUSIN GREG.
   UM, HE ALMOST LIT MY DRESS
    ON FIRE WITH HIS CIGAR.
  SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO COME.
            - WHAT?

             - YES.
     - HOW DID HE DO THAT?
   - THEY WERE HOISTING ME UP
           IN A CHAIR
       AND HE WAS HELPING
     AND HE HAD A LIT CIGAR

  AND THANKFULLY JARED'S MOM--
   THE DRESS STARTED TO SMOKE
        AND JARED'S MOM
    GRABBED THE CIGAR BEFORE
    MY DRESS WENT IN FLAMES.

     - HE COULDN'T EVEN PUT
      THE CIGAR OUT, HUH?
             - NO.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       BUT WHAT'S YOUR--
  WHAT'S YOUR BROTHER'S NAME?

            - GLENN.
         - GLENN, OKAY.
   LADIES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
  WE'LL SEE IF THEIR HUSBANDS

    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

       THE GUYS ARE BACK
    TO SEE IF THEY CAN MATCH
 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE.

       BEFORE WE DO THAT,
   LET'S CHECK ON THE SCORE.
       JARED AND JILLIAN,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH TEN POINTS.

       DON AND ADRIANNA,
   YOU GUYS HAVE FIVE POINTS.
      JONATHAN AND HOLLIE,
         YOU DON'T HAVE
        ANY POINTS YET,
        BUT WE'RE STILL

      RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
          OF THE GAME.
           ALL RIGHT.
    FELLAS, HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.

           GENTLEMEN,
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,
     WAS YOUR LAST ARGUMENT
   MORE LIKE A BORDER DEBATE
  BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CANADA,

      ENGLAND AND IRELAND,
         OR NORTH KOREA
        AND SOUTH KOREA?
           JONATHAN?

        - I'M GONNA HAVE
     TO SAY U.S. AND CANADA
          JUST BECAUSE
     WE'RE PRETTY PEACEABLE
   AND WE DON'T REALLY ARGUE
           THAT MUCH.

       ALTHOUGH I'M TORN,
       BECAUSE I REALLY--
     YOU'RE BRITISH, SO...
           [laughter]

     I'M GONNA GO WITH, UH,
        U.S. AND CANADA.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            HOLLIE?
      ENGLAND AND IRELAND.

          - AYE-YI-YI!
     - I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
       I'M FROM ENGLAND.
     YOU'RE AN IRISH TENOR.
 - I KNOW YOU'RE FROM ENGLAND.

        - I KNOW NOTHING
        ABOUT POLITICS.
             - DON?
       - GIRL, SERIOUSLY.
      - I'M GONNA GO U.S.
          AND CANADA.

      WE NEVER REALLY HAVE
        ANYTHING SERIOUS
     TO REALLY ARGUE ABOUT.
IT'S USUALLY ABOUT ME NOT DOING
      DISHES OR SOMETHING.

          - [chuckles]
      - SO I DON'T SEE IT
   BEING ANY WORSE THAN THAT.
     - ALL RIGHT, ADRIANNA?

       - U.S. AND CANADA.
         - THAT'S WHAT
       I'M TALKING ABOUT.
           [applause]

            - YEAH.
     JARED, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I'M GONNA SAY U.S.
          AND CANADA.

      WE'RE PRETTY DECENT.
  WE, UH--I COMPROMISE A LOT.
          I'M CANADA.
            - YEAH?

YOU'RE THE ONE THAT COMPROMISES
         ALL THE TIME?
        - YEAH, I, UH--
     I ALWAYS COMPROMISE...
            - YEAH.

  - AND I THINK IT'S VERY SAFE
            AND, UH,
      I'M GONNA SAY U.S.,
            CANADA.
   - WHAT'D YOU SAY, JILLIAN?

       - U.S. AND CANADA.
             - YES!
           GOOD JOB.
           [applause]
          - ALL RIGHT.

  GENTLEMEN, IN ORDER TO KEEP
   A LIFETIME OF SEX WITH YOU
      INTERESTING FOR HER,
  WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY SHE'D
  WANT MORE OF IN THE BEDROOM?

              DON?
      - GOING DOWN SOUTH.
             - OHH.
            - YEAH.

     I'D PROBABLY SAY THAT.
  - GOING DOWN TO YOUR BORDER,
              HUH?
    - SHE RESPONDS TO THAT.

  - UH, PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY
           DOES, DON.
           ALL RIGHT.
           [laughter]

   ADRIANNA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   - THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.
       - TAKE IT OUTSIDE.

        - I SAID OUTSIDE
        OF THE BEDROOM.
      YOU DO THAT ENOUGH.
             - OH!

            - WELL--
    - JARED, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I'M REALLY--LET'S GO
    WITH WHAT DON SAID AND,

    YOU KNOW, GO DOWN SOUTH.
     ALTHOUGH I DO IT NOW,
           IT'S, UH--
      I WOULD SAY IT'S ONE
       OF HER FAVORITES.

           [laughter]
           - JILLIAN,
   SHOULD HE KEEP DOING THAT?
      ROLE-PLAYING, JARED.
     - I SAID ROLE-PLAYING.

     YOU GOT TO SPICE IT UP
         A LITTLE BIT.
  THAT MIGHT GET BORING AFTER
   25 YEARS OF BEING MARRIED.
   - WE'VE NEVER ROLE-PLAYED
            THOUGH.

        - YEAH, COME ON!
         - THAT'S WHY.
        - YOU'RE A COP!
 THERE'S SO MANY THINGS TO DO.

     DON'T TAKE ME TO JAIL,
            OFFICER.
            COME ON!
      - MIGHT HAVE TO TRY
      THAT TONIGHT THOUGH.

         - YOU ALREADY
    GOT THE UNIFORM, JARED.
      ALL RIGHT, JONATHAN?
    - I'M JUST GONNA GO OUT
   ON A LIMB AND SAY THE EAR.

      - SO SHE WOULD WANT
       MORE OF YOUR EARS?
         - YEAH, SHE--
           [laughter]
SHE WOULD WANT UNFETTERED ACCESS
          TO MY EARS.

  - SHE WOULD WANT UNFETTERED
      ACCESS TO YOUR EARS?
  - TO BITE THEM, TO TUG THEM,
  AND TO JUST GENERALLY--UGH.
     - WHAT IS STOPPING HER
  FROM GETTING TO THESE EARS?

             - ME.
           - REALLY?
       ARE YOU SENSITIVE?
       - IT GETS ANNOYING
         AFTER A WHILE.

           - REALLY?
         - JUST--UNGH!
    STOP TUGGING AT MY EARS.
        - OKAY, HOLLIE,
CAN YOU LEAVE THOSE EARS ALONE?

        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   SHE SAID WITH HER ON TOP.
           [laughter]

      ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,
     HOW OFTEN DID SHE SAY
     YOU FIND IT NECESSARY
    TO SPEND SOME ALONE TIME

     WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND
   WHO LIVES BELOW YOUR BELT?
             JARED?
     - I'D SAY ONCE A DAY.

         - ONCE A DAY?
    - DEFINITELY FEEL BETTER
        ONCE IT'S DONE.
           [laughter]

            - OKAY.
    JILLIAN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       FIVE TIMES A WEEK.

        - THAT'S CLOSE.
   - SO WE'RE TWO DAYS SHORT.
           - COME ON.
  YOU KNOW I DO IT EVERY DAY.

           - GOT YOU.
           JONATHAN?
            - FOUR.
            - FOUR?
        - LET'S GO FOUR.

       - WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         SHE SAID NONE.
   - I THOUGHT I WAS ENOUGH!

        - I HAVE NEEDS!
           [laughter]
    WE'RE GETTING DIVORCED,
           AREN'T WE?

             - NO.
        ALL RIGHT, DON,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - THIS ONE BETTER BE A LAY-UP.

          ONCE A DAY.
         - ONCE A DAY?
           ALL RIGHT.
   WHAT'D YOU SAY, ADRIANNA?

          - EVERY DAY.
          - THAT'S A--
         NO, THIS HAND.
           [applause]

   - LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE.
       DON AND ADRIANNA,

  IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
  THIS CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.

   ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU READY?
  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    THE GUEST THAT TRAVELED
          THE FURTHEST

  TO OUR WEDDING WAS "BLANK,"
        WHILE THE GUEST
       I WOULD HAVE LIKED
        TO SHIP FAR AWAY
    WOULD HAVE BEEN "BLANK."

           JONATHAN?
 - THE GUEST THAT CAME FARTHEST
        AWAY WAS DEBBIE.
         SHE'S ENGLISH,
   SO SHE CAME FROM ENGLAND.

            - OKAY.
         - SO SHE CAME
    FROM THE FARTHEST AWAY.
      AND THE ONE TO GO--
       PUT FARTHEST AWAY

     WOULD HAVE BEEN CATHY.
          - WHY CATHY?
  - SHE'S A VERY LOVELY GIRL.

           [laughter]
          - ALL RIGHT.
      - BUT SHE'S LOVELY.
         SHE'S LOVELY.

  - HOLLIE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - YAY! YOU GOT ONE RIGHT!
      - DEBBIE AND CATHY!

           [applause]
           ALL RIGHT.
          - COME HERE.
  - YOU'RE BACK MARRIED AGAIN.

      YOU'RE IN THE LEAD.
           ALL RIGHT.
     JARED, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

         - FARTHEST WAS
       HER BROTHER GLENN.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  - THEY CAME FROM CALIFORNIA.

          THE ONE THAT
        WOULD I WANT OUT
        WOULD EITHER BE
         MY COUSIN GREG
        OR HER SISTER'S
    NOW EX-BOYFRIEND JESSE.

  I JUST DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE
     SHE DOESN'T LIKE MORE.
           [laughter]
  I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY JESSE.

       - GLENN AND JESSE.
   JILLIAN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - GLENN AND GREG.

 - GREG ALMOST BURNT MY DRESS!
       - I FORGOT HE DID.
        WE STILL GOT 15.

           [laughter]
           [applause]

        ALL RIGHT, DON,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - WELL, THE ONE THAT CAME
       THE FURTHEST AWAY
      WAS HER FRIEND JOE.

   THE ONE WE'D SEND FURTHEST
          WOULD BE...
        I GUESS I'LL GO
      WITH MY FRIEND MATT.
       - SO JOE AND MATT.

   WHAT'D YOU SAY, ADRIANNA?
         JOE AND YOUR--
    AND MY DEAD BOSS'S SON.
