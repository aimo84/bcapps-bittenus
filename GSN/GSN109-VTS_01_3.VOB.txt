    MY SON, ADEN, HAS ASTHMA.
      SECONDHAND SMOKE HAS
      TRIGGERED HIS ASTHMA

SO BAD TO THE POINT WHERE HE HAS
TO END UP IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM.
AND HE HAS SPENT MULTIPLE NIGHTS
       IN INTENSIVE CARE.
    NOW HE'S ON A WHOLE BUNCH
         OF MEDICATIONS.

        MY TIP TO YOU IS:
   DON'T BE SHY TO TELL PEOPLE
       NOT TO SMOKE AROUND

      OUR NEXT COUPLE MET

       FIRST, HE GAVE HER

       HIS POKE HER FACE.
    HERE ARE MIKE AND IRENE.

         AND WHEN THEY

 LET'S PLAY <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
       [energetic music]

  Captioning provided by GSN.
     [cheers and applause]
            - HELLO.

       HELLO, AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
  HELLO, FELLAS, HOW ARE YOU?
         - DOING GREAT.
    - VERY GOOD, VERY GOOD.
          - EXCELLENT.

 - ALL RIGHT, KEEP THAT ENERGY,
      BECAUSE WE HAVE SENT
 YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE SO WE CAN
    ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.
   WE WILL GET RIGHT INTO IT.

       IF YOU COULD PICK
        ONE SEXUAL ROLE
   FOR YOUR WIFE TO PLAY OUT,
   IT WOULD BE NAUGHTY NURSE,

      NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL,
     OR NAUGHTY LIBRARIAN?
            CARLYLE.

   - UM, I GUESS I WOULD HAVE
          TO SAY, UH,
  PROBABLY NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.
     - NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.
- YOU KNOW, NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL,

      CAUSE I VE ALWAYS HAD
         A THING FOR--
       WELL, SHE WENT TO
CATHOLIC SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING,
    SO I ALWAYS HAD A THING
  FOR THOSE CATHOLIC SCHOOL...

  - THE WHOLE GUILTY PLEASURE
         KIND OF THING.
       - YES. ABSOLUTELY.
       - ALL RIGHT. MIKE?
     - I M GONNA HAVE TO GO
    WITH, UH, NAUGHTY NURSE.

       SHE S, UH, ALWAYS
       TAKING CARE OF ME,
 AND THERE S NOTHING NAUGHTIER
THAN A NURSE TAKING CARE OF YOU.
   - YEAH. ALL RIGHT. DAVID?

     - I WOULD SAY THE, UH,
      NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.
   - THE NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.
  - SHE S A LITTLE BIT YOUNGER
            THAN ME,

       SO I THINK WE CAN
       JUST GO WITH THAT.
            - OKAY.
   NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS--
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

  I WISH A COP WOULD HAVE BEEN
       THERE TO REMIND ME
 OF MY RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
  THEN I NEVER WOULD HAVE TOLD
         MY WIFE BLANK.

           - [laughs]
            - MIKE?
     - UM, ONCE, ONLY ONCE,
I MADE A MISTAKE OF TELLING HER
     TO CHANGE HER CLOTHES,

    BECAUSE SHE DIDN T LOOK
       VERY NICE IN THEM.
             - OH.
     - ONCE, SHERRI, ONCE.
    - YOU TOLD ONE HER TIME.
  - THAT S THE ONLY--ONLY ONE.

       - AND YOU LEARNED.
         - YES, MA AM.
  - SO IF SHE WEARS SOMETHING
      THAT YOU DON T LIKE,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
 -  YOU LOOK WONDERFUL, HONEY.

          - AH. DAVID?
             - HMM.
 I-I GUESS I D HAVE TO SAY, UM,

          TO PUT DOWN
    THE FRENCH FRIES MAYBE,
         CAUSE I THOUGHT
    SHE WAS STARTING TO GAIN
      A COUPLE OF POUNDS.

             - OOH.
           - [laughs]
        - OKAY. CARLYLE?
- I-I GUESS IT WOULD BE, FOR ME,

    UH, WHEN I TOLD HER THAT
SHE DIDN T NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT,
  ONLY BECAUSE SHE, YOU KNOW,
 SHE S VERY HEALTH CONSCIOUS...
           - MM-HMM.
   - AND--AND, YOU KNOW, SHE,

      YOU KNOW, SHE THINKS
      A LOT OF HER FIGURE,
    AND SO SHE THOUGHT THAT
I WAS TELLING THAT IT WAS OKAY.
     YOU KNOW, I DON T CARE
         HOW SHE LOOKS.

         AND SHE WASN T
  TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT, SO...
   - OKAY. THIS IS OUR FINAL
      QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
    ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS,

      WHAT S THE ONE PART
      OF YOUR WIFE S BODY
   YOU PAY MORE ATTENTION TO
        THAN THE OTHERS?
             DAVID?

   FRECKLES ON HER SHOULDERS.

             - OH.
   - SO I LIKE HER FRECKLES.
         - AND CARLYLE?
     - I VE ALWAYS THOUGHT
THAT SHE HAS VERY SENSUOUS LIPS
         AND EVERYTHING

         AND JUST THAT,
     YOU KNOW, THAT S WHAT
    I WOULD PAY ATTENTION TO
      BESIDES THE OBVIOUS.
            - MIKE?

    - NOT THE OBVIOUS, HUH?
       - NOT THE OBVIOUS.
        - UH, HER FACE.
          - HER FACE.
     - YEAH, JUST HER FACE.
I THINK SHE S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

 AND EVERY TIME I LOOK AT HER,
      I JUST FALL IN LOVE.
            all: AW.
     - YOU JUST DON T LIKE
      WHAT SHE S WEARING.

   - I M MAKING UP FOR THAT.

  EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS WORTH
    5 POINTS, SO HERE WE GO.
 IF YOUR HUSBAND COULD PICK ONE
SEXUAL ROLE FOR YOU TO PLAY OUT,
     DID HE SAY IT WOULD BE
         NAUGHTY NURSE,

      NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL,
     OR NAUGHTY LIBRARIAN?
          BERNADETTE?

   - I M THINKING--YOU KNOW,
    HE LIKES TO READ A LOT,
        SO I M GONNA SAY
       NAUGHTY LIBRARIAN.
 - I HAVE A FEELING HE WOULDN T
     BE READING THE BOOKS.

 - MM. DEFINITELY NOT. [laughs]
- NAUGHTY LIBRARIAN, ALL RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
   - CARLYLE, WHAT D YOU SAY?

  - UH, I THINK I M GONNA SAY
      NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.
             - WHY?
  - THE SKIRT, THE KNEE-HIGHS.
 I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THAT S
   WHAT HE WOULD WANT TO SEE.

         - OKAY. MIKE?
        - ALMOST RIGHT.
        - NAUGHTY NURSE.
 - THE SKIRT AND THE KNEE-HIGHS
     COULD STILL BE THERE.

           - [laughs]
      ALL RIGHT. LINDSAY?
     - I LOVE YOU, SHERRI.
            [laughs]
        - OH, THANK YOU.

           THANK YOU.
  - UM, I M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
      NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL,
    CAUSE I M 8 YEARS YOUNGER
           THAN HIM,

       SO MAYBE HE LIKES
     THE SCHOOLGIRL THING.
           - [laughs]
        - I DON T KNOW.
   - [laughs] SO HE MAY LIKE
  THE YOUNGER YOU, ALL RIGHT.

  - I SAID NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.
     - NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.
          - YAY! MWAH.

      - NAUGHTY, NAUGHTY.
       ALL RIGHT, WIVES,
   HERE S OUR NEXT QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

  I WISH A COP WOULD HAVE BEEN
       THERE TO REMIND ME
 OF MY RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.
  THEN I NEVER WOULD HAVE TOLD
         MY WIFE BLANK.

             IRENE?
     - ABOUT A FIRST WIFE.
  - HE DIDN T WANT ME TO KNOW.

             - MM.
 - OKAY. WHAT D YOU SAY, MIKE?
    - I ASKED HER TO CHANGE
     HER CLOTHES ONE TIME.
       - WHEN HE TOLD YOU
    TO CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.

     DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
         - YEAH, IT...
  - BECAUSE I DON T LIKE WHEN
  YOU DON T LIKE WHAT I WEAR?
            - RIGHT.

- WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE TOLD YOU
    TO CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES?
   - WELL, I GOT MAD AT HIM.
            - YEAH.
   - BUT HE SHOULD--IT SHOULD
   ALWAYS BE THAT I M RIGHT,

        AND YOU KNOW...
         - ABSOLUTELY.
 - NEVER SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE.
      - I TOLD YOU, ONCE.
     IT ONLY HAPPENED ONCE.
       - HE DID IT ONCE.

  AND HE KEPT SAYING, HE KNOWS
  EXACTLY WHERE HE WENT WRONG.
 - I GUESS HE S A FAST LEARNER.
  - YEP, HE SURE IS. LINDSAY?
 - THAT HE WANTED A THREESOME?
         I DON T KNOW.

     I DON T KNOW WHAT TO--
     I DON T KNOW WHAT SAY.
           - [laughs]
    - [laughs] I DON T KNOW.
     - HOW DO YOU SAY THAT?

  - WELL, I DON T KNOW. I FEEL
 LIKE MAYBE HE BROUGHT THAT UP.
           - [laughs]
 - YOU FEEL LIKE IT, OR HE DID?

  LIKE, WAS HE LIKE,  HONEY, I
LIKE PANCAKES WITH SOME SAUSAGE.
   CAN WE HAVE A THREESOME?
           I MEAN...
           - NO, NO.
            [laughs]

 - KIND OF WHAT--WHAT DID HE--
      WHEN--WHAT HAPPENED?
           - [laughs]
     I DON'T--I DON T KNOW.
- OKAY, WELL, NOW WHAT HAPPENED?
         DID IT HAPPEN?

           [laughter]
- OH. ALL RIGHT, MUM S THE WORD.
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?

    - SO, DAVID, DID YOU ASK
        FOR A THREESOME?
        - UM, WE STARTED
       DIETING LATELY...
     - OH, I WAS GONNA SAY.

      - SO I YELLED AT HER
 TO PUT DOWN THE FRENCH FRIES.
  - PUT DOWN THE FRENCH FRIES.
    - I WAS GONNA SAY THAT,
  BUT I DIDN T THINK YOU WOULD
   SAY THAT ON TV. ALL RIGHT.

   - SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW,
          DID HE SAY,
     PUT DOWN THE FRENCH FRY
  AND LET S HAVE A THREESOME ?
           - [laughs]
    - ALL RIGHT, BERNADETTE?

   - THAT HE WANTED TO DO IT
       IN A PUBLIC PLACE.
 - AND WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?
     - WELL, WE DID KIND OF
         DO THAT ONCE.

- YOU DID KIND OF DO THAT ONCE.
            - ONCE.
    - WHERE WAS THAT PLACE?
  - AT OUR WEDDING RECEPTION.
            - OKAY.
   CARLYLE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

         - OKAY, I SAID
    THE TIME THAT I TOLD YOU
      THAT YOU DIDN T NEED
       TO LOSE WEIGHT...
             - OH.

- AND YOU WERE ALL LIKE,  WHAT?
YOU RE HAPPY WITH ME LIKE THIS?
     - I WAS LIKE,  YEAH.
   AND YOU THOUGHT THAT MEANT

   THAT I DIDN T REALLY CARE
    OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
  - YEAH, I GUESS THAT S TRUE.
       - LADIES, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.

    ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS,
WHAT S THE ONE PART OF YOUR BODY
       YOUR HUSBAND SAID
   HE PAYS MORE ATTENTION TO
        THAN THE OTHERS?

            LINDSAY?
        - MAYBE MY HAIR,
  CAUSE HE ALWAYS SAYS THAT HE
WANTS ME TO WEAR MY HAIR DOWN...
          - ALL RIGHT.
     DAVID, WHAT D YOU SAY?

    -  CAUSE IT LOOKS NICE.
         I DON T KNOW.
      - I SAID SHOULDERS,
    CAUSE I LIKE THE FRECKLES
       ON HER SHOULDERS.

 - FRECKLES ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
 - OH, OKAY. THAT S A GOOD ONE.
     ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
      - YEAH. BERNADETTE?
           - MY FACE.
          - ALL RIGHT.

     - WELL, WE WERE CLOSE.
          - YOUR LIPS.
      - I SAID YOUR LIPS.
             - OH.
       - HE SAID YOU HAVE
        VERY SENSUOUS--

      VERY SENSUOUS LIPS.
             - AW.
          - IT S OKAY.
           - [laughs]
  - AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, IRENE?

 - HE ALWAYS SAYS THAT HE LIKES
  MY FACE, AND HE SAYS THAT...
    - SO HOW DOES HE SAY IT?
        DOES HE JUST GO,
    HONEY, I LIKE YOUR FACE ?

           - [laughs]
         I DON T KNOW.
        WELL, YOU KNOW,
      BEFORE WE DO STUFF,
   HE ALWAYS KISSES MY FACE,
           YOU KNOW.

        - SO IT'S LIKE,
 HONEY, YOU WANT TO GO CAMPING?
       I LIKE YOUR FACE ?
       - WELL, YOU KNOW,
  IT JUST GETS THINGS STARTED,

 SO I KNOW THAT HE LIKES THAT.
 - OKAY, MIKE, WHAT D YOU SAY?
         - I SAID FACE.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
 DURING SEX, THE CRAZIEST THING
   I HAVE EVER BEEN ON TOP OF
           WAS BLANK.

          BERNADETTE?
     - THE BACK OF A SOFA.
 - WAS IT A CRAZY KIND OF SOFA?

     - NO, IT WAS A REGULAR
         KIND OF SOFA,
BUT YOU KNOW, BEING ON THAT PART
       MADE IT DIFFERENT.
- ON THE BACK OF IT, ALL RIGHT.
        - YEAH. [laughs]

            - IRENE?
        - I M GONNA SAY
      THE KITCHEN COUNTER.
       - KITCHEN COUNTER.

    - AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE
  ALTHOUGH IT S NOT SO CRAZY,
       WE RE FOOD PEOPLE,
   AND WE ALWAYS LIKE TO EAT,
     SO TO PUT YOUR BODIES
     ON WHERE YOUR FOOD IS,

     THAT S A LITTLE IFFY.
  - YEAH, YOU GUYS ARE KIND OF
 DOING A  9 1/2 WEEKS  KIND OF
  WITH ALL THE FOOD GOING ON.

            - YEAH.
     - ALL RIGHT. LINDSAY?
     - ON THE COUCH. YEAH.
         - ON THE COUCH
    WAS THE CRAZIEST PLACE?

    - IT S NOT THE CRAZIEST.
 - YOU GUYS ARE A CRAZY BUNCH,
         I GOT TO SAY.
       - I M GONNA SAY--
    I M GONNA SAY THE COUCH.

       - LADIES, THIS IS
       HE NEXT QUESTION.
     IF YOUR HUSBAND HAD $1
 FOR EVERY TIME YOU TURNED DOWN
HIS ADVANCES IN THE LAST MONTH,

 HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD HE HAVE?
             IRENE?
       - OH, GOSH, A LOT.
           - [laughs]

       - JUST HAD A BABY,
      SO I HAVE AN EXCUSE.
    - OKAY. HOW IS THE BABY?
        CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU. SHE S--SHE S GREAT.
           [applause]

             - YES.
      - SO I M GONNA SAY,
         UH, 100 BUCKS.
        - OKAY. LINDSAY?

             - $1.
- YEAH, ONLY ONE TIME, I THINK.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
     - SO HE S VERY HAPPY.

        - [laughs] YEP.
         - BERNADETTE?
  - I THINK HE S BE BROKE. $0.
             - $0.
            - YEAH.

    - ALL RIGHT, SO CARLYLE
    IS A HAPPY MAN AS WELL.
       - LUCKY. [laughs]
    - ALL RIGHT. I LOVE IT.
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.

       DOES YOUR HUSBAND
     SQUEEZE THE TOOTHPASTE
 FROM THE BOTTOM, FROM THE TOP,
 OR FROM SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN?

            LINDSAY?
    - HE ALWAYS SQUEEZES IT
        FROM THE MIDDLE,
 AND IT DRIVES ME CRAZY,  CAUSE
   I LIKE IT FROM THE BOTTOM.

THAT WAY YOU GET ALL THE STUFF.
        SO I M GONNA SAY
     FROM--FROM THE MIDDLE.
     SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.
 - SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. OKAY.

          BERNADETTE?
     - I THINK IT WOULD BE
          THE BOTTOM.
       CAUSE WE--YOU KNOW,
    MY SONS ARE THERE, TOO,

        SO I DON T KNOW
WHO S SQUEEZING WHERE. [laughs]
   - IT S JUST BEEN SQUEEZED.
- BUT I NOTICE THAT IT S ALWAYS
      RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM,

SO I LL HAVE TO SAY THE BOTTOM.
         - OKAY. IRENE?
         - HANDS DOWN,
     DEFINITELY THE BOTTOM,

       CAUSE IF I SQUEEZE
 ANYWHERE ELSE, HE GETS ANGRY.
  SO WE EVEN HAVE ONE OF THOSE
 LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU PUT ON.
   - OH, THE SQUEEGEE THINGS?
             - YES.

TO MAKE SURE THAT I M CONSTANTLY
   SQUEEZING FROM THE BOTTOM.
  I CANNOT DEVIATE FROM THAT.
     - WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT?
        WAS THAT MIKE S?

  - WELL, I BOUGHT IT SO THAT
   HE WOULDN T GET MAD AT ME.
           - [laughs]
- SO DEFINITELY FROM THE BOTTOM.
      - ALL RIGHT. GOT IT.
LADIES, HERE S A BONUS QUESTION.

   IT HAS 2 PARTS. EACH PART
IS WORTH 15 POINTS. HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
 THE BEST THING ABOUT TRAVELING
   WITH MY HUSBAND IS BLANK,

  AND THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING
           IS BLANK.
          BERNADETTE?
    - I GUESS THE BEST THING
     IS THAT, I DON T KNOW,

          IT'S USUALLY
     SOMETHING SPONTANEOUS,
   SO THE SPONTANEITY OF IT,
     YOU KNOW, SPONTANEOUS.
      AND THE WORST THING
  MIGHT ALSO BE THE SAME THING

    BECAUSE THEN IT S LIKE,
   WELL, WE NEED TO GET THIS
       OR THAT, YOU KNOW.
        - SO SPONTANEITY
      AND THE SPONTANEITY.

     - AND THEN, YEAH, THEN
   SOMETIMES IT DOESN T WORK,
  BECAUSE THEN YOU DON T HAVE
   WHAT YOU NEED OR WHATEVER.
         - OKAY. IRENE?

  - HE S DEFINITELY EFFICIENT
           AND FAST.
       HE TRAVELS A LOT,
  SO HE KNOWS WHAT HE S DOING.
    AND SAME WAY THAT S ALSO
      THE NEGATIVE THING,

BECAUSE I FIND MYSELF RUNNING TO
KEEP UP WITH HIM IN THE AIRPORT.
         - WE NEED ONE.
          - EFFICIENT.
- EFFICIENT. NOW THE SECOND ONE,
      THE ABSOLUTE WORST.

     - I LL SAY FAST, YEAH.
            - FAST.
   OKAY. EFFICIENT AND FAST.
       GOT YOU. LINDSAY?
       - THE WORST THING
    IS THAT HE S IMPATIENT.

      HE ALWAYS IS SAYING,
        ARE WE THERE YET?
  WHEN ARE WE GONNA BE THERE?
           YOU KNOW.
 HE S ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE GPS
             TO SEE

 WHAT OUR ARRIVAL TIME WILL BE.
            - YEAH.
    - UM, BUT THE BEST THING
    IS THAT HE PACKS LIGHT,
    SO WE USUALLY ONLY NEED
      ONE SUITCASE, SO...

   - OKAY. THANK YOU, LADIES.

  JUST HOW WELL THEIR HUSBANDS

       - ALL RIGHT. MIKE?
      - I WANT TO SAY ME.
            - IRENE?

     - WE RE ALWAYS EATING
        ON THE COUNTER,
      AND NOW WE RE, LIKE,
       DOING IT ON THERE.

           - CARLYLE?

        - MY BEST GUESS
      WOULD BE THE BOTTOM.
     - DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE
  YOU SQUEEZE FROM THE BOTTOM,
       OR ARE YOU JUST...

      HE'S GONNA COME HOME
   LOOKING LIKE A LUMBERJACK.

 HERE ARE TONIGHT'S NEWLYWEDS.
  OUR FIRST BRIDE IS 15 YEARS
     OLDER THAN HER GROOM.
    WHEN THEY GO OUT TO EAT,

DO YOU THINK SHE CUTS THE CRUST
      OFF HIS SANDWICHES?
      MEET JESSE AND FRAN.
  HE PROPOSED BY SPELLING OUT
      "WILL YOU MARRY ME"

     ON THE <i>SCRABBLE</i> BOARD,
        AND THAT NIGHT,
     HE TRIPLE WORD SCORED.
   HERE ARE TRE' AND LYNDSEY.

     AND THESE HIGH SCHOOL
  SWEETHEARTS HAVE BEEN DATING
      SINCE THEY WERE 14.
    FIRST THEY LOCKED EYES,
    THEN THEY LOCKED BRACES.

    WELCOME KEVIN AND JENN.
 LET'S PLAY <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
         [upbeat music]

  Captioning provided by GSN.
        - HELLO, HELLO.
              HI!

       HELLO, AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
         HELLO, FELLAS.
         - HI, SHERRI.
      - HI. I SENSE AN AIR
 OF ANTICIPATION. AM I CORRECT?

         - ABSOLUTELY.
             - YEP.
   - ALL RIGHT. WELL, WE HAVE
   SENT YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.

    LET'S GET RIGHT INTO IT.
   IF A BILLIONAIRE PROMISED
     YOUR WIFE $10 MILLION
      TO GO A YEAR WITHOUT
     ONE OF THE FOLLOWING,

   WHICH WOULD BE THE HARDEST
      FOR HER TO GIVE UP--
      CHOCOLATE, SHOPPING,
            OR SEX?
             JESSE?

     - DEFINITELY SHOPPING.
            - YEAH?
       - THAT WOMAN CAN--
     SHE SHOPS LIKE CRAZY.
  - I MEAN--OH, YEAH. SHOES--

     I MEAN, WE HAVE, LIKE,
  TWO CLOSETS FULL OF CLOTHES.
        IT'S RIDICULOUS.
       - YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
         - ABSOLUTELY,
      DEFINITELY SHOPPING.

         - OKAY. TRE'?
       - I WOULD SAY SEX.
             - SEX?
            - YEAH.
         - OKAY. KEVIN?

  - I WOULD 100% SAY SHOPPING
  BECAUSE SHE'S GOT DRESSERS,
      CLOSETS, EVERYTHING
         IN THAT HOUSE,
       AND I'VE GOT JUST
     ONE DRESSER TO MYSELF.

       - YOU'VE GOT ONE--
          - THAT'S IT.
 - THAT'S IT? NO CLOSET SPACE?
       - NO ROOM FOR ME.
   NO ROOM FOR ME, JUST HER.
     - OH, MAN. ALL RIGHT.

    HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
         FINGERNAILS ON
     A CHALKBOARD ARE BAD,
 BUT WHEN I HEAR BLANK'S VOICE
         GETTING NEAR,

   A SHIVER GOES UP MY SPINE.
             TRE'?
   - I'D HAVE TO SAY NOBODY.
           IS THAT--
        - NOBODY AT ALL?
         - NO, NOBODY.

         - OKAY. KEVIN?
  - I'M GONNA GET IN TROUBLE,
   BUT WHEN I HEAR HER VOICE
        SCREAMING AT ME,

        THAT MAKES MY--
    THAT MAKES ME GO CRAZY.
    - SO WHEN YOU SAY "HER,"

       IS THAT YOUR WIFE?
 - YEAH, MY WIFE'S SHRILL, YES.
  - DOES ANYBODY HAVE A HELMET
      FOR KEVIN TO PUT ON
       BEFORE JENN COMES?
ALL RIGHT, YOU BRAVE SOUL, YOU.

       - UH-HUH, UH-HUH.
            - OKAY.
      - ONLY THING I FEAR.
            - JESSE?
        - UM, I'M GONNA
      HAVE TO SAY NOBODY.

   - OKAY, ALL RIGHT. THIS IS
 OUR FINAL QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
 THE LAST TIME YOUR WIFE WANTED
    TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS,
   HOW DID SHE LET YOU KNOW?

             KEVIN?
 DID SHE USE HER SHRILL VOICE?
            - NO...
            OH, NO.

      UM, WE WERE ACTUALLY
      DOWN IN OCEAN CITY.
        - IN OCEAN CITY.
    - OCEAN CITY, MARYLAND,
AND WE WERE LAYING DOWN IN BED,
         AND SHE GOES,

 "LET'S GO OUT TO THE BALCONY."
             - AH.
   - SO I SAID, "ALL RIGHT."
       - AND SO YOU KNEW.
     - DIDN'T PASS THAT UP.
         - OKAY. JESSE?

      - SHE FLAT OUT SAID,
     "HEY, BABE, I WANNA,"
     YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW...
            - YEAH.

         - AND I SAID,
     "ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO."
            - YEAH?
    - SO SHE'S VERY DIRECT?
- YEAH, DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY.

       - ALL RIGHT. TRE'?
 - UM, SHE DEFINITELY SAID, UH,
         "RUB MY BACK."
  - SO "RUB MY BACK" IS CODE?

            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.
         - SOMETIMES--
SOMETIMES IT'S JUST A BACK RUB.
     - SOMETIMES IT'S JUST
          A BACK RUB?

        - YOU KNOW, YEP.
      - BUT OTHER TIMES...
             - YEP.
- ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, THANK YOU.

         - HI, SHERRY.
             - HI.
        - HI. ALL RIGHT.
   WELL, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
  EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS WORTH
    5 POINTS, SO HERE WE GO.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
        FIRST QUESTION.
        IF A BILLIONAIRE
    PROMISED YOU $10 MILLION
      TO GO A YEAR WITHOUT
     ONE OF THE FOLLOWING,

   WHICH DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
      WOULD BE THE HARDEST
      FOR YOU TO GIVE UP--
      SHOPPING, CHOCOLATE,
            OR SEX?

             FRAN?
   - BOY, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
             - AHH.
           - UM, SEX.
       - IT WOULD BE SEX?

           - MM-HMM.
            - OKAY.
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY?
      - PROBABLY SHOPPING.
      - HE SAID SHOPPING.
           - [groans]

        - OKAY. LYNDSEY?
  - WELL, I DISLIKE SHOPPING,
       AND CHOCOLATE, EH,

    SO I WOULD GO WITH SEX.
  - YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH SEX?
             - YES.
  - ALL RIGHT. WHAT'D YOU SAY?
           SEX, TRE'.

             YEAH.
        ALL RIGHT, JENN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I WOULD DEFINITELY
         SAY SHOPPING.

          - SHOPPING.
         - DEFINITELY.
           - NO SEX?
        - NO--SHOPPING.
           - SHOP...

         - I TOLD YOU.
    - KEVIN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     - I TOLD YOU, SHERRI.
          I TOLD YOU.
          - SHOPPING.

       - GIVE ME A KISS.
     LOVE YOU. I TOLD YOU.
    - LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

  FINGERNAILS ON A CHALKBOARD
            ARE BAD,
 BUT WHEN I HEAR BLANK'S VOICE
         GETTING NEAR,
   A SHIVER GOES UP MY SPINE.

            LYNDSEY?
  - I DON'T KNOW, TRE'S REAL--
       HE DOESN'T REALLY
        DISLIKE ANYBODY.

  I WOULD--I WOULD SAY NOBODY.
- OKAY. WHAT DID YOU SAY, TRE'?
       TRE' SAID NOBODY.
             - OH!

            - JENN?
    - I DON'T THINK ANYBODY.
      HE REALLY DOESN'T--

     HE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
    A PROBLEM WITH ANYBODY.
            - OKAY.
     KEVIN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   - WHEN MY WIFE COMES HOME
         YELLING AT ME,

        IT SENDS SHIVERS
         DOWN MY SPINE.
       - THAT'S NOT NICE.
 - WHAT IS IT ABOUT YOUR VOICE,
          SWEET JENN?

 - PROBABLY BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS
      SITTING ON THE COUCH
          PLAYING Xbox
 WHEN I WALK IN THE DOOR, SO...
             - OH.

      - I'M SURE HE HATES
      HEARING ME SAY THAT.
   - YEAH, YOU LEFT A REALLY
CRUCIAL PART OF THAT OUT, KEVIN.
         - YEAH. YEAH.

    - THAT'LL SEND ANY WIFE
     INTO SHRILL SCREAMING,
           THAT Xbox.
 OKAY, WE GOT YOU. WE GOT YOU.
          OKAY, FRAN?

- I DON'T THINK HE HAS A PROBLEM
     WITH TOO MUCH ANYBODY,
    BUT IF HE HAD TO COME UP
        WITH AN ANSWER,
 IT'S PROBABLY MY AUNT RUTHIE.

      - YOUR AUNT RUTHIE?
           - MM-HMM.
        - TELL ME ABOUT
       YOUR AUNT RUTHIE.
      - UM, I DON'T KNOW,
THERE'S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT HER

      THAT GRATES ON HIM.
    - IT JUST GRATES ON HIM.
     JESS, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - [clears throat]
 - JESSE WENT AND SAID NOBODY.
            - OKAY.

  - SO JESSE'S NOT IN TROUBLE,
            YOU ARE.
      - OKAY. YEAH, I AM.
  WHEN MY AUNT SEES THE SHOW.
       - I'M IN TROUBLE.
        I'M IN TROUBLE.

     - YOU DIDN'T SAY ANY--
       THAT'S YOUR WIFE.
      - I CAN'T BELIEVE--
            [groans]
- OKAY, LADIES, FINAL QUESTION.

    THE LAST TIME YOU WANTED
    TO GET DOWN TO BUSINESS,
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
     SAY YOU LET HIM KNOW?
             JENN?

  - I PROBABLY JUST TOLD HIM,
            LIKE...
      - YOU JUST TOLD HIM?
            - YEAH.
    - SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
 WHEN YOU SAY, I JUST TOLD HIM?

            - WANNA?
         I DON'T KNOW.
      - ALL RIGHT. KEVIN?
   - GO TO THE BALCONY, JENN.

   - LET'S GO TO THE BALCONY.
         - AM I RIGHT?
             - NO.
             - NO?
  - MAYBE ONCE, I DON'T KNOW.

       - ALL RIGHT, FRAN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         - I TOLD HIM.
        - YOU TOLD HIM?
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?

   - I TOLD HIM WHAT I WANTED
         TO DO TO HIM.
      AND HE PUT HIS PHONE
          RIGHT DOWN.
   - WHAT DID YOU SAY TO HIM?

     - I TOLD HIM I WANTED
    TO KISS HIM DOWN THERE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             HEY...
          GIRL, FRAN,

        IT WORKS FOR US.
 - HEY, HE PUT HIS PHONE DOWN.
 - I'M--HE PUT THE PHONE DOWN.
             JESSE?

   SAID HEY, BABY, YOU WANNA,
           YOU KNOW?
             YEAH!
             YEAH.

           [laughing]
     THAT'S IT, ALL RIGHT.
            LYNDSEY?

      - I NEVER INITIATE,
           SO, UM...
BUT LUCKILY, HE INITIATES ENOUGH
    THAT WE DO HAVE PLENTY,
   BUT I WOULD SAY I DID NOT
          MAKE A MOVE.

  - SO THE LAST TIME YOU GUYS
 WERE GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS,
    YOU DID NOT MAKE A MOVE?
             - NO.
 - OKAY. TRE', WHAT'D YOU SAY?

     YOU SAID RUB MY BACK.
             - OH.
            - YEAH.
     - WELL, THAT WASN'T--
 I JUST WANTED MY BACK RUBBED.
             - OH!

    OH, SO IT DIDN'T MEAN--
     - SOMETIMES IT'S JUST
          A BACK RUB.
        - THEN HE TAKES
        ADVANTAGE OF ME.

  - LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
   TRE' AND LYNDSEY, YOU ARE
  IN THE LEAD WITH 10 POINTS.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN

  TO ANSWER QUESTIONS, AND THE
POINTS ARE DOUBLED. STAY TUNED.

      - OKAY, HERE WE GO.

   IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE
    MY SKILL FOR FAKING IT,

 WATCH ME PRETEND TO LIKE BLANK
   JUST TO PLEASE MY HUSBAND.
            LYNDSEY?
     - I WOULD SAY WATCH ME
        PRETEND TO LIKE

 A MOVIE THAT HE WANTS TO SEE.
    'CAUSE HE LOVES MOVIES,
    AND I DON'T REALLY ENJOY
         WATCHING THEM.

  - ALL RIGHT, YOU DON'T LIKE
      WATCHING ANY MOVIES?
   - WELL, I DO, BUT HE COULD
 WATCH MOVIES FIVE TIMES A DAY,
       AND HE'S ALWAYS--
     WHEN WE HAVE DOWNTIME,

    HE'S LIKE, "OH, YOU WANT
       TO WATCH A MOVIE?"
       I'M LIKE, "YEAH."
            - "NO."
        - BUT I SAY YES.

      - YEAH, OKAY. JENN?
  - I WOULD SAY WATCHING GOLF.
        HE'S CONSTANTLY
   WATCHING THE GOLF CHANNEL.

   THERE'S NOT MUCH TO WATCH
      ON THE GOLF CHANNEL.
        - NOTHING, HUH.
          OKAY, FRAN?

      WHAT'S THE BEST GIFT
  YOUR HUSBAND COULD GIVE YOU
    WITHOUT SPENDING A DIME?
             JENN?
          - HIS TIME.

          - A MASSAGE.
            - SURE.
       - GOT IT. LYNDSEY?

   - I WOULD SAY A BACK RUB.
   AM I ALLOWED TO SAY THAT?
      BECAUSE EVERY NIGHT
       RELIGIOUSLY I SAY,

    "WILL YOU RUB MY BACK?"
            - YEAH?
      - AND I REALLY JUST
        WANT A BACK RUB.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.

        IT HAS 2 PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
          DO YOU WISH
    YOUR LOVEMAKING SESSIONS

         WERE SHORTER,
    LONGER, OR MORE INTENSE,
AND HOW DOES YOUR HUSBAND FEEL?

             FRAN?
      - OURS ARE PERFECT.
       - THEY'RE PERFECT?
            - YEAH.

      - WELL, FOR PURPOSES
          OF A POINT--
        - FOR 30 POINTS.
  - FOR PURPOSE OF A POINT...
            - YEAH.

      - SHORTER, FOR BOTH.
   - SHORTER FOR BOTH, OKAY.

          WOULD IT BE

     - I HIT ALL THE SPOTS,
     YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

       - ALL RIGHT, FRAN?
       JESSE SAYS HE HITS
         ALL THE SPOTS.
    FRAN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

    - YOU SAID YOU COULDN'T
           GO WRONG.
          - THANK YOU.

       TO COME SIT HERE.
- I DON'T COMPLAIN ABOUT--I LIKE

THE BEST GIFT YOU COULD GIVE HER
    WITHOUT SPENDING A DIME.

     - I ALREADY HAVE THAT.
  - OKAY, SHE SAID A MASSAGE.
           - [groans]
    - SHE'S GOT YOUR HEART.

  - A GIFT WOULD BE SOMETHING
     I DON'T ALREADY HAVE.
  - I DIDN'T HEAR THE QUESTION
RIGHT THEN, THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

        THE GOOD NEWS IS

         THE BAD NEWS--
        SHE ALSO HAD TO

     BUY AN OLD BICYCLE AND
 LAWN CHAIRS JUST TO MEET HIM.

HE'S A FIREFIGHTER, AND HIS WIFE
      IS TOTALLY TURNED ON

      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
       SECOND HONEYMOON.
      SO IF YOU'RE READY,
   HERE'S THE FIRST QUESTION.
     WHAT IS THE LAST THING
       YOUR WIFE LICKED?

          A BAD HABIT?
       AN ICE CREAM CONE?
       OR YOUR LOVE PIPE?

  KYLE, WE'LL START WITH YOU.
             - UM.
    UM, SHE DOESN'T REALLY--
   KIND OF A THING FOR DAIRY.

       - YOU'RE GONNA GO
      WITH THE LOVE PIPE?
            - YEAH.

          - DOES THAT
         HAPPEN OFTEN?
           - UM, YES.
            IT DOES.
            - YEAH?
     - SO I'M A LUCKY GUY.

         I'LL SAY THAT.
     - YOU ARE A LUCKY GUY.
         YES, YOU ARE.
        ALL RIGHT, TODD.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - UM, I DEFINITELY HAVE TO SAY
    THE HABIT, A BAD HABIT.
         - WHAT WAS THE
     BAD HABIT SHE LICKED?
         - UM, FIGHTING
      WITH ME OVER, UM...

     - IS THAT A BAD HABIT?
            - UH...
       - OR ARE YOU JUST
  DOING A LOT OF STUFF WRONG?
      - I THINK I DO A LOT
     OF STUFF WRONG, YEAH.

            - YEAH?
        - BUT, UH, YEAH.
        - BUT YOU THINK
       SHE'S LICKED THAT?
  - SHE'S LICKING THAT HABIT.
        - OKAY, GOTCHA.

    RODNEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - UH, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
       THAT SHE WOULD SAY
     THE LOVE PIPE, 'CAUSE
  IT'S BETTER THAN ICE CREAM.

       - THE LOVE PIPE IS
     BETTER THAN ICE CREAM.
        WELL, DEPENDS ON
     WHAT FLAVOR SHE LIKES.
       AH, THE LOVE PIPE.
           I GOT YOU.

   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
     DOPPLER RADAR GIVES US
   PLENTY OF ADVANCE WARNING
      BEFORE A STORM HITS.

           BUT WHAT'S
     THE ONE TELLTALE SIGN
        YOUR WIFE GIVES
        TO LET YOU KNOW
            A STORM
      IS BREWING AT HOME?

             TODD?
           - [sighs]
          THAT SOUND.

    - AH--WHAT'S THAT SOUND?
         GIVE IT AGAIN.
           - [sighs]
         - THAT SOUND.
         AND YOU KNOW?

    - OH, I AM IN--I'M IN--
         I BETTER STOP.
 I'D BETTER STOP WHAT I'M DOING
    OR I AM IN DEEP TROUBLE.
      - YOU ARE IN FOR IT.
            - YEAH.

        - OKAY, GOTCHA.
            RODNEY?
     - SHE GIVES ME A LOOK.
         AN EVIL LOOK.

       - WHAT'S THE LOOK?
         CAN YOU DO IT?
           [laughing]
             OKAY.
     KYLE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - I'M GONNA SAY
      SHE LEAVES THE ROOM.
        AND MY INSTINCT
       IS NOT TO FOLLOW,
        BUT I'M SUPPOSED
    TO FOLLOW, I'VE LEARNED.

   - BUT SHE JUST WALKS OUT.
            - YEAH.
        - OKAY, GOTCHA.
       ALL RIGHT, FELLAS.
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.

        THERE'S NOTHING
       MORE SPECIAL THAN
       THAT "I DO" MOMENT
      ON YOUR WEDDING DAY.
       SO FROM THE MOMENT
     YOUR WIFE SAID "I DO,"

         HOW MANY HOURS
    WENT BY BEFORE YOU SAID,
         "LET'S DO IT"?
            RODNEY?

      - PROBABLY WAS ABOUT
        TWO HOURS LATER.
    - ABOUT TWO HOURS LATER?
            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.

   AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, KYLE?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
          RIGHT AFTER.
    'CAUSE SHE KIND OF MADE
   A JOKE ABOUT IT IN THE CAR

           ON THE WAY
       TO THE RECEPTION.
- SO AS SOON AS SHE SAID "I DO."
          RIGHT AFTER.
   - THAT'S WHAT SHE WANTED,
         SHE SUGGESTED.

 SO I'LL SAY RIGHT AFTER, YEAH.
            - YEAH?
    AND YOU JUST WENT ALONG
      WITH THE SUGGESTION?
            MM-HMM.
     TODD, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - I'D SAY, UH--
         AND I FEEL BAD
        FOR SAYING THIS,
      BUT ABOUT SIX HOURS.
       - ABOUT SIX HOURS?

        WERE YOU ANTSY?
       - IT WAS--IT WAS--
       IT WAS HARD, YEAH.
      - WELL, I KNOW THAT.
          I KNOW THAT.

         OKAY, FELLAS.

         SO HERE WE GO.
            LADIES,

     WHAT IS THE LAST THING
YOUR HUSBAND SAID YOU'VE LICKED?
          A BAD HABIT?
       AN ICE CREAM CONE?

       OR YOUR LOVE PIPE?
     - CRISTINA, I'M GONNA
        START WITH YOU.
    - OH, THAT'S DEFINITELY
         HIS LOVE PIPE.

    - THAT'S THE LOVE PIPE?
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  - I LICK THAT ALL THE TIME.
        - AND WHAT ABOUT
      THE ICE CREAM CONE?

       - I'D RATHER HAVE
         THE LOVE PIPE.
         - RATHER HAVE
         THE LOVE PIPE?
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - I SAID THE LOVE PIPE.

        - THE LOVE PIPE.
       YOU MAKE NO BONES
           ABOUT IT.
         YOU KNOW WHAT
        YOU WANT, GIRL.

             OKAY.
          WE'RE GONNA
       GO TO YOU, MELISA.
        - UH, I WILL SAY
         THE LOVE PIPE.

          - WHY DO YOU
         SAY IT SO COY?
        "THE LOVE PIPE."
          OKAY, TODD.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

          A BAD HABIT?
         - A BAD HABIT.
            - WHAT?
       - CAN YOU TELL HER
     WHAT THE BAD HABIT IS

      THAT SHE'S LICKING?
      - FIGHTING WITH ME.
  - THAT--ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

         - YOU'VE BEEN
     SO MUCH BETTER LATELY.
           - THAT IS
          SO NOT TRUE.
        - DON'T YOU LIKE
  THE LOVE PIPE ANSWER BETTER?

          - I DO LIKE
  THE LOVE PIPE ANSWER BETTER.
            - YEAH.
           ALL RIGHT.
    CHANA, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

      - AN ICE CREAM CONE
          IS PROBABLY
         REALISTICALLY
  THE LAST THING I'VE LICKED.
   - WHAT DID YOU SAY, HUBBY?

    - I SAID THE LOVE PIPE.
        - THE LOVE PIPE.
     YOU STILL DON'T THINK
      IT'S THE LOVE PIPE.
         - I'M SO MAD.

     - YOU'RE STICKING WITH
    THE ICE CREAM CONE, HUH?
    - OKAY, THE LOVE PIPE IS
DEFINITELY GETTING NO LICKS NOW.
             - OH!

       WE'RE GONNA GO ON
     TO THE NEXT QUESTION.
     DOPPLER RADAR GIVES US
   PLENTY OF ADVANCE WARNING
      BEFORE A STORM HITS.

 BUT WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
    IS THE ONE TELLTALE SIGN
  YOU GIVE HIM TO LET HIM KNOW
  A STORM IS BREWING AT HOME?
            MELISA?

        - IT'S THE SIGH.
            IT'S...
       - HOW DOES THAT--?
           - [sighs]

       - AND THAT--AND HE
    KNOWS WHEN YOU DO THAT?
   - IT'S VIRTUALLY CONSTANT.
         BUT, UH, YEAH.
          YES, THAT'S
    DEFINITELY THE TIP-OFF.

       - OH, MY GOODNESS.
           ALL RIGHT.
  TODD, WHAT DO YOU SAY IT IS?
          - THE SIGH.

           HE KNOWS.
    - I HAD TO HOLD THAT IN.
     I HAD TO HOLD THAT IN.
      - ALL RIGHT, CHANA.
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?

            - MAYBE
    THE ROLLING OF THE EYES.
          - CAN I SEE
    THE ROLLING OF THE EYES?
        WHAT DO YOU DO?

    YEAH, AND THEY JUST GO.
  ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I SAID THE LOOK.

       - THAT'S THE LOOK.
        I WILL SAY YEAH.
        OKAY, CRISTINA.
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?

  - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH
   A LOOK, I GUESS, AS WELL.
   - WELL, SHOW ME YOUR LOOK.
          I'M GETTING
       SCARED RIGHT NOW.

    OKAY...ALL RIGHT, KYLE.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        - YEAH, THERE'S
       SOMETIMES A LOOK.
           BUT I SAID
       "LEAVES THE ROOM."

       - LEAVES THE ROOM.
- MAN, IT'S NOT LEAVE THE ROOM.
  - YOU ALWAYS LEAVE THE ROOM
  AND I HAVE TO GO CHASE YOU.
            - OKAY.
           ALL RIGHT.

     WE'RE GONNA GO TO OUR
    FINAL QUESTION, COUPLES.
  THERE'S NOTHING MORE SPECIAL
    THAN THAT "I DO" MOMENT
      ON YOUR WEDDING DAY.

       SO FROM THE MOMENT
        YOU SAID "I DO,"
       HOW MANY HOURS DID
    YOUR HUSBAND SAY WENT BY
        BEFORE HE SAID,
         "LET'S DO IT"?

             CHANA?
         - I'LL SAY 48.
 'CAUSE WE HAVE THE LITTLE ONE
AND WE DON'T GET A LOT OF TIME.

          NOT AS MUCH
          AS WE NEED.
        WE REALLY DON'T.
            - OKAY.

        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
      - I SAID TWO HOURS.
          - TWO HOURS.
      ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE
 TALKING ABOUT THE SAME THING?

      - DUDE, WHO ARE YOU?
       YOU'RE OFF TODAY.
          - IS HE OFF?
  HE'S OFF BY, LIKE, 46 HOURS.
    - I KNOW, ARE YOU SURE?
   - THAT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE.

        - YOU GUYS WORK
    THAT OUT BY YOURSELVES.
      ALL RIGHT, CRISTINA.
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?

    - UM, I'M GONNA SAY THAT
HE WANTS TO DO IT ALL THE TIME.
      ALWAYS WANTS TO GET
     IN MY PANTS, THIS ONE.
        UM, SO I'M GONNA
      GO WITH ONE MINUTE.

     - ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
         WHAT YOU SAY.
    WHAT DO YOU SAY, HUBBY?
         - RIGHT AFTER.
   - RIGHT AFTER, ZERO HOURS!
         THERE YOU GO!

    DIDN'T TAKE LONG AT ALL!
       ALL RIGHT, MELISA.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - UH, WELL, WE HAD
        A WEDDING AWAY.

      AND WE HIT A LOT OF
    TRAFFIC ON THE WAY BACK.
   AND THEN--SO MUCH SO THAT
 WE HAD TO DELAY OUR HONEYMOON.
       UM, SO IT WAS LIKE
     A FULL 48 HOURS BEFORE

      WE COULD GET IT ON.
             AND SO
     I'M GONNA GO WITH 48.
  - EVERYTHING'S SO TECHNICAL.
            REALLY?

          - [laughing]
          YEAH, YEAH!
           - WHAT DID
       YOUR HUSBAND SAY?
          - SIX HOURS.
      - I SAID SIX HOURS.

    I ASKED AFTER SIX HOURS.
      IT'S VERY TECHNICAL.
            - YEAH!
- IT ALL SOUNDS VERY TECHNICAL.
   - SO WAS IT THE 48 HOURS?

       OR WAS IT THE SIX?
        - IT WAS THE 48.
      - OH, I'M SO SORRY.
          WELL, LOOK.

       WE HAVE COUPLE ONE
        WITH TEN POINTS.
      YOU ARE IN THE LEAD.
  COUPLE TWO AND COUPLE THREE,
 YOU ARE TIED WITH FIVE POINTS.

     YOU'VE STILL GOT TIME
       TO TURN IT AROUND.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

         AND THIS TIME
    THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED.

   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH,

     IS OUR FIRST QUESTION.

       IF ONE MILE EQUALS
       ONE EX-GIRLFRIEND,
  HOW MANY MILES DID YOUR MAN
 TRAVEL ON THE FREEWAY OF LOVE
       BEFORE HE GOT OFF
     FOR GOOD AT YOUR EXIT?

           CRISTINA?
             - OH.
     UM, I FEEL LIKE WE'VE
     HAD THIS CONVERSATION
   BUT I NEVER REALLY KNOW--
    IT'S GOTTA BE, LIKE, 14.

          - ALL RIGHT.
         - HE WAS A BIT
     OF A WHORE IN COLLEGE.
     - HE WAS A BIT OF A--
           [laughing]

     OKAY, 14 MILES WE GOT.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, MELISA?
       - I'LL SAY THREE.

         - THREE MILES?
         - THREE MILES.
        HE'S NOT GOTTEN
         AROUND A LOT.
            - YEAH,
      HE STARTED THE CAR.

    HE DIDN'T GET VERY FAR.
         - NO, NO, NO.
         - THREE MILES.
            GOTCHA.

    CHANA, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
  - I'M GONNA SAY TWO, BECAUSE
THERE'S ONLY TWO THAT I KNOW OF.
            - OKAY.
 - AND I'M THINKING, YEAH, TWO.

        - SO TWO MILES.
            GOTCHA.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
           HABITS ARE
         HARD TO BREAK.

      SO TELL ME, WHAT IS
 THE ONE HABIT YOUR HUSBAND HAS
          THAT REALLY
        DRIVES YOU NUTS?
            MELISA?

       - HE ALWAYS LEAVES
      THE DISH TOWEL OUT.
     - AND THAT MAKES YOU--
WHERE IS HE SUPPOSED TO PUT IT?
   - IT'S THE SIMPLEST THING.
   IT'S WET, YOU HANG IT UP.

         SO IT DOESN'T
      GET MOLDY AND GROSS.
          - IT IS THAT
      DISH TOWEL LEFT OUT.
 IT SHOULD BE HUNG UP, GOTCHA.
             - YES.

            - SHANA?
        - RODNEY REFUSES
      TO EMPTY HIS POCKETS
         WHEN HE TAKES
        HIS CLOTHES OFF.

         SO, LIKE, WHEN
       I'M DOING LAUNDRY,
 THERE'S PENS, THERE'S CHANGE,
  THERE'S ALL TYPES OF STUFF.
    GUM...LIKE, HE'S ALWAYS
     MESSING UP MY CLOTHES.

        - SO HE DOES NOT
       EMPTY HIS POCKETS?
             - NO.
           - GOT IT.
           CRISTINA?

        - UM, MY HUSBAND
     IS SECRETLY A MONKEY.
   - HE'S SECRETLY A MONKEY?
         WHAT IS THAT?
          - SO HE EATS
     SO MANY DAMN BANANAS,

         AND HE LEAVES
     THE PEELS EVERYWHERE.
   IN MY BACKSEAT IN MY CAR,
     LIKE, IN THE CABINET.
       I MEAN, THEY'RE--

       - SO IT'S LIKE YOU
     HAVE A PET SOMEWHERE.
            - YEAH.
    - LEAVING BANANA PEELS.
   - BANANA PEELS EVERYWHERE.
 - ALWAYS LEAVING BANANA PEELS.

            GOT IT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
         NEXT QUESTION.
    JUST LIKE OUR NEWLYWEDS,
          PLAYTEX BRAS

       KNOWS THE VALUE OF
    FINDING THE PERFECT FIT.
        LADIES, WHEN WAS
   THE LAST TIME YOU WOKE UP
       AND THE TWO OF YOU
         WERE SPOONING?

       JUST THIS MORNING?
            SOMETIME
       IN THE LAST MONTH?
          OR NOT SINCE
        YOU WERE DATING?

             CHANA?
         - THAT'S EASY.
   NOT SINCE WE WERE DATING.
            THE BABY
      IS STILL IN THE BED.

            - YEAH?
    - HE'S 18 MONTHS AND HE
 STILL SLEEPS BETWEEN US, SO...
        - SO NO SPOONING
       IN THE LAST MONTH.

             - NO.
            - OKAY.
         AND CRISTINA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - UM, I'M GONNA
     GO WITH THIS MORNING.

         - YOU SPOONED?
      - WELL, IT'S A RULE.
        WHEN WE "DO IT,"
    THERE'S SPOONING AFTER.
 - THERE'S SPOONING AFTERWARDS?
            - SO...

       - NO CONVERSATION,
   BUT GET THAT SPOONING IN.
       - YEAH, SO IT WAS
         THIS MORNING.
           - MELISA?

  - NOT SINCE WE WERE DATING.
  - NOT SINCE YOU WERE DATING?
     - MAYBE NOT EVEN EVER,
     BUT IF THE SMALLEST--
           WE'RE NOT,
    I'M NOT A SPOONING TYPE.

       YOU KNOW, I'VE GOT
      A PILLOW ON ONE SIDE
          I'VE GOT HIM
         ON THE OTHER.
  AND IT'S ALL VERY COZY AND--
- SO YOU GET IT FROM THE PILLOW?

       AND NOT THAT WARM,
   WONDERFUL MAN NEXT TO YOU?
        - NO, YOU KNOW,
         WE HAVE OUR--
       OUR, UH, YOU KNOW,
        TOUCHING ACTION.

          - [laughing]
         - I GET MINE,
      EVERYTHING'S GREAT.
         BUT, YOU KNOW,
       WHEN I'M SLEEPING,

        I NEED MY SPACE.
           - GOT IT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
  HERE IS OUR BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
           EACH PART
      IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

           IF YOU HAD
    TO COMPARE YOUR HUSBAND
           TO A FOOD,
 YOU WOULD SAY HE'S LIKE BLANK
     BECAUSE HE'S SO BLANK.

           CRISTINA?
          - HE'S LIKE
       CAROLINA BARBECUE,
           BECAUSE HE
    IS VERY TANGY AND SWEET.

  - DID YOU SAY TINY OR TANGY?
            - TANGY.
          - OH, TANGY.
     OKAY, MY FAULT, GIRL.
  - OH, HONEY, HE'S NOT TINY,
          DON'T WORRY.

I'M LIKE, "BARBECUE'S NOT TINY."

    WHAT ABOUT YOU, MELISA?

     - WHAT'S A GASSY FOOD?
           IS THAT...
            - YEAH.
       - BEANS ARE GASSY.

       - BEANS AND GASSY.
       - HE'S LIKE BEANS,
     BECAUSE HE'S SO GASSY.
             - YES.
       THAT IS MY ANSWER.

          - MAYBE NOW
         YOU KNOW WHY.
             - OH!

    BECAUSE HE'S VERY SWEET.

        BUT HE CAN ALSO
         BE QUITE SOUR.
