     ON THE FREEWAY OF LOVE
           BEFORE YOU
        GOT OFF FOR GOOD
          AT HER EXIT.
             KYLE?

          - [laughing]
   - WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?
      - MAYBE A LITTLE BIT
        OF A LONG TRIP,
            BUT, UH,
        I WOULD SAY 13.

         - YOU SAY 13?
            - YEAH.
    - I MEAN, WAS IT, LIKE,
     A MINIVAN THAT YOU HAD
         WHEN YOU WERE
    GOING DOWN THE FREEWAY?

         SO YOU SAY 13?
      - YEAH, I'LL SAY 13.
        - OKAY, WHAT DID
         YOUR WIFE SAY?
       SHE SAID 14 MILES.

          - SO CLOSE.
        ALL RIGHT, TODD.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - AS FAR AS A JOURNEY,
      BEFORE I GOT OFF...

          - [laughing]
   - UH, I'D SAY 1,000 MILES.
         - 1,000 MILES?

            - YEAH.
          - WOW, TODD.
        ONE MILE EQUALS
       ONE EX-GIRLFRIEND.

- OH, THEN I'M MISUNDERSTANDING
      THE QUESTION, THEN.
            - OKAY.
       I WAS, LIKE, WOW!
     - I'M MISUNDERSTANDING
         THE QUESTION.

          THREE MILES.
         - THREE MILES?
         - THREE MILES.
     - ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID
         YOUR WIFE SAY?

          THREE MILES!
          OH, MY GOSH.
        YOU SAID 1,000.

   I'M GOING, YOU ARE IN TR--
   WHERE ARE ALL THESE WOMEN?
          OKAY, GUYS.
  RODNEY, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
- I'LL SAY SHE SAID FOUR MILES.
         - FOUR MILES.

           ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, CHANA?
         - I SAID TWO.
          - TWO MILES.
     - I ONLY KNOW OF TWO.
           - UM, NO.

             - OH.
         OKAY, RODNEY.
    NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

   HABITS ARE HARD TO BREAK.
   SO WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY
   IS THE ONE HABIT OF YOURS
          THAT REALLY
        DRIVES HER NUTS?

             TODD?
       - THE DISH TOWEL.
        - WHAT DO YOU DO
     WITH THIS DISH TOWEL?

   - YOU PUT THIS DISH TOWEL
   ON THIS LITTLE RACK THERE.
         I DON'T THINK
    I'VE EVER PUT IT THERE.
            - OKAY.

        - I DON'T THINK
  I'VE EVER PUT IT THERE ONCE.
       - HMM, ALL RIGHT.
WELL THEN, WHAT DID MELISA SAY?
           IT'S THAT
        DARN DISH TOWEL.

       ALL RIGHT, RODNEY.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         - I THINK SHE
         WOULD SAY THAT
     I KEEP A LOT OF THINGS
         IN MY POCKETS.

   - WHAT KINDS OF THINGS DO
   YOU KEEP IN YOUR POCKETS?
       - UH, PAPER CLIPS,
        MINTS, TISSUES.
           ANYTHING.

       I'M LIKE MACGYVER,
  I CAN BUILD A BOMB OUT OF--
        - WITH THE STUFF
        IN YOUR POCKETS?
            - YEAH.

      - DO YOU EVER EMPTY
        YOUR POCKET OUT?
         - YEAH, I DO.
          EVENTUALLY.
   - CHANA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     - THOSE DAMN POCKETS.
         - THE POCKETS!
     - YOU BETTER NOT HAVE
     GOTTEN THAT ONE WRONG.
     - ALL RIGHT, AND WHAT
       DO YOU SAY, KYLE?

- UH, I WOULD SAY I PROBABLY EAT
   TWO OR THREE BANANAS A DAY
  AND SHE'S ALWAYS CALLING ME,
  LIKE, A MONKEY ALL THE TIME.
            BUT, UH,
     I END UP LEAVING THEM.

     SOMETIMES I, YOU KNOW,
         I'M IN A RUSH
      AND THE BANANA PEEL
       ENDS UP IN THE CAR
     AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

       SO AND...YOU KNOW,
 SHE'S YELLING AT ME FOR THAT.
   - WHAT IS IT ABOUT BANANAS
     THAT'S SO FASCINATING?
        WHY DO YOU LIKE
        SO MANY BANANAS?

  - NUTRITIOUS, HEALTHY SNACK.
         I DON'T KNOW.
          - [laughing]
           ALL RIGHT,
      AND WHAT DO YOU SAY?

    LEAVES THE BANANA PEELS
          EVERYWHERE!
           ALL RIGHT.
        OKAY, GENTLEMEN.

       THIS NEXT QUESTION
       IS BROUGHT TO YOU
       BY THE FIT EXPERTS
        AT PLAYTEX BRAS.
      GUYS, YOUR WIFE SAID
         THE LAST TIME

         THE TWO OF YOU
    WOKE UP SPOONING WAS...
       JUST THIS MORNING?
          SOMETIME IN
        THE LAST MONTH?

          OR NOT SINCE
        YOU WERE DATING?
            RODNEY?
         - I WOULD SAY
   NOT SINCE WE WERE DATING.

             - WHY?
        - 'CAUSE WE HAVE
     A LITTLE, SMALL CHILD
  AND HE SLEEPS IN THE MIDDLE
   AND HE'S STICKING HIS LEGS

           IN MY BACK
        AND EVERYTHING.
   - SO NO SPOONING GOING ON.
         - NO SPOONING.
          - ALL RIGHT,
      WHAT DID CHANA SAY?

             - YUP.
  - NOT SINCE WE WERE DATING.
          OKAY, KYLE.
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
        - UH, I'M GONNA
       SAY THIS MORNING.

   AND NOT REALLY BY CHOICE,
  REALLY JUST BECAUSE SHE HOGS
      THE WHOLE ENTIRE BED
   AND IS USUALLY ON MY SIDE.
      - OH, SO THIS ISN'T
     EVEN A ROMANTIC THING.

        IT'S JUST 'CAUSE
       SHE HOGS THE BED.
     - YEAH, AND JUST KIND
     OF WAKES UP THAT WAY.
       - WHAT DO YOU SAY?

       JUST THIS MORNING.
      - JUST THIS MORNING.
    - TODD, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
           - I'D SAY
   NOT SINCE WE WERE DATING.

AND I'D SAY THAT BECAUSE MELISA
  HAS TO SLEEP A CERTAIN WAY.
           SO I'M NOT
       BREATHING ON HER.
          - [laughing]

           ALL RIGHT,
   WHAT DID YOU SAY, MELISA?
           NOT SINCE
        WE WERE DATING.

         I DON'T KNOW.
       I'LL GO WITH THAT.
         THAT'S AWFUL.

     - ALL RIGHT, CRISTINA.
    IS HE HOT AND WELL DONE?
         LIKE BARBECUE?
    YOU'RE BARBECUE BECAUSE
    YOU'RE TANGY AND SWEET.

      YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
      - I GOT HALF RIGHT.
         - OKAY, TODD.
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

  - SHE'D SAY LIKE AN AVOCADO,
      'CAUSE I'M HEALTHY.
        - OKAY, MELISA.

       - YOU ARE SO DEAD.

         CRAFTY COUPLES
    TO LET IT ALL HANG OUT,

  SO, GARY, WOULD YOU TELL ME
   ABOUT THESE CUTE COUPLES?
      - COUPLE NUMBER ONE,
     TRAVIS AND BOBBI SUE.
   SHE SET OFF THE FIRE ALARM
      ON THEIR WEDDING DAY

          AND CLAIMED
      IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
      TRUTH IS, BOBBI SUE
  WILL DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING
      TO SEE A FIREFIGHTER
           IN ACTION.

       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
      JONATHAN AND RACHEL,
         ENJOY SPEAKING
    BABY TALK TO EACH OTHER
       AND CURRENTLY LIVE
     IN HER MOM'S BASEMENT.

     THEY ALSO TRIED TO BUY
 THEIR OWN PLACE IN NEVERLAND,
         BUT PETER PAN
        WASN'T SELLING.
    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
        DAVE AND SARAH.

        THE BAD NEWS IS
       THEY HAD TO SPEND
    PART OF THEIR HONEYMOON
        AT THE HOSPITAL.

        THE GOOD NEWS IS
  THEY ENJOYED PLAYING DOCTOR
     IN THEIR PRIVATE ROOM.
      BACK TO YOU, SHERRI.

     [cheers and applause]
     - OH, DAVE AND SARAH,
       DID YOU REALLY GET
        A PRIVATE ROOM?

      - YEAH, THEY TURNED
        OUR PRIVATE ROOM
    INTO A HONEYMOON SUITE.
       EVEN ON THE DOOR,
   THEY PUT "DO NOT DISTURB."

            - YEAH.
     ♪ BOW CHICKA BOW BOW
          - [laughing]
           ALL RIGHT,
   NOW, JONATHAN AND RACHEL,

         YOU'RE LIVING
       WITH YOUR MOM NOW,
 BUT I HEAR THAT YOU'RE MOVING
 INTO THE CITY IN A FEW WEEKS.
       SO CAN YOU TELL ME
        WHAT'S THE THING

     THAT YOU'RE GONNA MISS
 THE MOST ABOUT LIVING AT HOME?
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY,
     EVERY TIME I GET HOME,
          I ALWAYS GET
A CHEERY HELLO FROM HER MOTHER,

         AND I ALSO GET
    A "HAVE YOU EATEN YET?"
     WHICH IS REALLY NICE.
  - HE'S RIGHT, BECAUSE I CAN
  HARDLY MAKE A BAG IF POPCORN

      WITHOUT BURNING IT.
          - ALL RIGHT,
 NOW, BOBBI SUE, WAIT A MINUTE.
       DID YOU REALLY GET
 THE WHOLE FIRE DEPARTMENT OUT

      ON YOUR WEDDING DAY?
        - UNFORTUNATELY,
  THE MORNING OF THE WEDDING,
         I WAS STEAMING
       MY WEDDING DRESS,

 AND I SET UP THE STEAMER RIGHT
  UNDERNEATH THE SMOKE ALARM,
        AND IT WENT OFF,
 AND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT CAME,

AND THE FIREFIGHTERS LITERALLY,
   LIKE, BROKE DOWN MY DOOR.
 - BUT NOW YOU GUYS ARE SETTING
   FIRES ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?
        - ALL THE TIME.
        - THERE YOU GO.

           ALL RIGHT,
       WELCOME, COUPLES.
      ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK
         TO ALL OF YOU.
  NOW, LADIES, I'M GONNA HAVE
  TO ASK THAT YOU WOULD GET UP

       AND GO BACKSTAGE,
 BECAUSE WE GOT SOME QUESTIONS
  WE GOTTA ASK YOUR HUSBANDS.
   ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I'M GONNA
   ASK Y'ALL THREE QUESTIONS,

 AND IT'LL BE UP TO YOUR WIVES
     TO MATCH YOUR ANSWERS.
THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST POINTS
     AT THE END OF THE GAME
      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
       SECOND HONEYMOON.

   SO IF YOU'RE READY, HERE'S
YOUR FIRST QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
    INCLUDING SOLO MISSIONS,
    HOW OFTEN DO YOU DEPLOY
          YOUR TROOPS

      IN AN AVERAGE WEEK?
            TRAVIS?
   - UH, BOBBI SUE WOULD SAY
        NOT ENOUGH, UH,

   BECAUSE I PROBABLY HAVEN'T
            DEPLOYED
   THE TROOPS ENOUGH LATELY,
    SO SHE'D SAY NOT ENOUGH.

          NOT ENOUGH?
             - YES.
          - ALL RIGHT,
   WHAT DO YOU SAY, JONATHAN?
       - WE'LL SAY THREE.

         - THREE TIMES?
    - YEAH, WE'LL SAY THREE.
        - OKAY, AND WHAT
        ABOUT YOU, DAVE?
             - TWO.
    SHE WOULD SAY TWO TIMES.

       - ABOUT TWO TIMES?
   - YEAH, TWO TIMES A WEEK.
          - ALL RIGHT,
   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN,

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
    IF MY WIFE WAS FEATURED
         ON AN EPISODE
    OF OPRAH'S FINAL SEASON,

       THE TITLE WOULD BE
   "WOMEN WHO BLANK TOO MUCH
 AND THE MEN WHO DEAL WITH IT."

   WHAT DO YOU SAY, JONATHAN?
          - I'M GONNA
       HAVE TO SAY TALK,
        BECAUSE SHE DOES
          TALK A LOT.

    - YOUR WIFE TALKS A LOT?
     - SHE DOES TALK A LOT.
           I LISTEN,
      BUT SHE TALKS A LOT.

   - OKAY. BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
          ON AVERAGE,
         WE HAVE, LIKE,
       100,000 MORE WORDS
          THAT WE SAY
       WAY MORE THAN YOU.

     - IS THAT WHAT IT IS?
    - YEAH, BECAUSE WE LIKE
         TO TALK A LOT.
    THAT'S JUST WHAT WE DO,

    BECAUSE WE DON'T RUN OUT
       OF THINGS TO SAY,
        BECAUSE THE LIFE
        IS SO EXCITING,
         AND THE WORLD
   IS SO EXCITING AROUND US,

   AND WE JUST LOVE TO TALK.
    I MEAN, I KNOW I SHOULD
PROBABLY STOP TALKING RIGHT NOW.
    - I'M LISTENING TO YOU.
    - I CAN'T STOP TALKING.

    IT JUST COMES OUT OF ME.
       I CANNOT STOP IT.
      I JUST LOVE TALKING.

         DON'T HOLD IT
          AGAINST HER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       - I SHOULD REALLY
        LET YOU FINISH.

    - WELL, I WAS LISTENING
     TO YOU THE WHOLE TIME,
         SO IT'S FINE.
     BUT I AGREE, TO TALK.

     - SO TALKING, GOT YOU.
        ALL RIGHT, DAVE,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
          - SHOPPING.

           - SHE SAYS
       SHE WANTS TO SAVE,
    BUT SHE LIKES SHOPPING.

           - I KNOW,
     BUT IT'S JUST SO HARD
      WHEN YOU GOT A PAIR
       OF SHOES ON SALE.
    - YEAH, SHE WAS ALREADY
   TALKING ABOUT YOUR SHOES.

             - OH!
    TRAVIS, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
    - UH, I'M GOING TO SAY,
         UH, COMPLAIN.

          - COMPLAIN.
           I GOT YOU.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
     IN TERMS OF PREPARING
       FOR YOUR WEDDING,

      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
          YOU'RE HAPPY
         TO NEVER HAVE
      TO DEAL WITH AGAIN?
             DAVE?

        - MAKING A LIST
         OF WHO YOU CUT
       AND WHO TO INVITE
      AND STUFF LIKE THAT.
        - THAT HAD TO BE
         SO STRESSFUL.

    - IT WAS VERY STRESSFUL.
             - UGH.
    TRAVIS, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - UH, I'M GOING TO SAY
        THE SAME THING,

       CUT THE LIST DOWN.
    - ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE
        HAD TO GET CUT?
    - UH, PROBABLY ABOUT 30.

       - ABOUT 30 PEOPLE?
   ARE THOSE 30 PEOPLE OKAY?
            - THERE
      STILL TALKIN', YES.

        - OKAY. [laughs]
        WHAT DO YOU SAY,
           JONATHAN?
       - I'LL HAVE TO SAY
    PAYING FOR THE WEDDING.

         IT WAS BIG HIT
      ON MY POCKET THERE.
        - SO THAT PAYING
        FOR THE WEDDING?
            - YEAH.
           - GOT YOU.

 ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, THAT WAS
    A WONDERFUL JOB YOU DID.
      WHILE WE'RE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,
    GARY, COULD YOU TELL US
ALL ABOUT THAT SECOND HONEYMOON?

      - TONIGHT'S WINNERS
    ARE GOING TO COSTA RICA.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
   NOW, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.
         SO HERE WE GO.
            LADIES,
    INCLUDING SOLO MISSIONS,

  HOW OFTEN DOES YOUR HUSBAND
       DEPLOY HIS TROOPS
      IN AN AVERAGE WEEK?
           BOBBI SUE?

             - WOW.
      THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
      I DON'T LIKE TO TALK
      ABOUT SOLO MISSIONS,
      BUT FOR THE PURPOSE
      OF THE SHOW I WILL.

          - [laughing]
         - IN ONE WEEK?
             - YES.
          - ONE WEEK?

     - IN AN AVERAGE WEEK.
   - A FULL WEEK, SEVEN DAYS.
  I AM GONNA SAY THREE TIMES.
          - ALL RIGHT,
     AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?

          NOT ENOUGH.
  - THAT'S NOT EVEN A NUMBER.
    - THAT'S ALL YOU TELL ME
    IS I DON'T DO IT ENOUGH.

            - OKAY,
  WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, RACHEL?
    - I'M GOING TO SAY TWO.
             - TWO?

     OKAY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
          THREE TIMES.
          - OH, OKAY,
        BUT I WAS CLOSE.

        - IT WAS CLOSE.
      - I LOVE YOU ANYWAY.
         - SARAH, WHAT
         WOULD YOU SAY?
        - I WOULD SAY...

       FIVE DAYS A WEEK.
           TWO TIMES?
      - HE SAID TWO TIMES.
        - I WISH IT WAS
       FIVE TIMES A WEEK.

          - YEAH, BUT
       ON YOUR OWN, TOO?
      - I DIDN'T WANT YOU
           TO KNOW--
          - YOU DIDN'T
       WANT TO KNOW THAT?

      - SHE'S NOT SUPPOSED
      TO KNOW ABOUT THEM.
        - OH! ALL RIGHT.
    COUPLES, NEXT QUESTION.

  LADIES, HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    IF MY WIFE WAS FEATURED
         ON AN EPISODE
    OF OPRAH'S FINAL SEASON,

       THE TITLE WOULD BE
   "WOMEN WHO BLANK TOO MUCH
      AND THE MEN WHO DEAL
           WITH IT."

       ALL RIGHT, RACHEL?
     THE WOMEN WHO COMPLAIN
           TOO MUCH,
          AND THE MEN
       WHO DEAL WITH IT.

    - DO YOU COMPLAIN A LOT?
    - YES, AND HE HATES IT,
       BUT I HAVE ISSUES.
           TOO MANY.

        - SO MANY ISSUES
         TO DEAL WITH.
           JONATHAN,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        - WELL, SHE DOES
        COMPLAIN A LOT,

     BUT WHEN COMPLAINING,
         SHE'S TALKING.
          - OHH. BABE!
    COME ON, YOU YELL AT ME
 ALL THE TIME FOR COMPLAINING.

            - YEAH,
     'CAUSE YOU'RE TALKING.
     - WHATEVER, I'M RIGHT.
        - OH, I'M SORRY.

          OKAY, SARAH,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - OKAY, WELL, HANDS DOWN,
      I KNOW THIS ANSWER.
     I WOULD SAY IT'S WOMEN
       WHO SHOP TOO MUCH.

      - IS THAT A PROBLEM
         THAT YOU HAVE?
      - UM, I DON'T THINK
        IT'S A PROBLEM.
           [laughing]

   HE THINKS IT'S A PROBLEM.
          - ALL RIGHT,
    WELL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    WOMEN WHO SHOP TOO MUCH.
             - YAY!

           [applause]
    - ALL RIGHT, BOBBI SUE,
          IT'S ON YOU.
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH
THE WOMEN WHO COMPLAIN TOO MUCH.

  - TRAVIS, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           COMPLAIN.
             - YAY!
              ONE!
            - YEAH!

           GOOD JOB.
          - ALL RIGHT,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
      LADIES, IN TERMS OF
  PREPARING FOR YOUR WEDDING,

   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
        IS THE ONE THING
           HE'S HAPPY
         TO NEVER HAVE
      TO DEAL WITH AGAIN?

             SARAH?
      - I WOULD SAY, UM...
       THE THING THAT HE
  WILL NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH

    AND IS VERY HAPPY ABOUT
        IS ALL THE MONEY
 THAT WE SPENT FOR THE WEDDING.
            - YEAH?

        - I WOULD THINK
       THAT THAT WOULD BE
 SOMETHING HE'S HAPPY TO NEVER
    HAVE TO DEAL WITH AGAIN.
          - ALL RIGHT,
     DAVE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

         - SHE'S RIGHT,
       BUT ALSO, THAT WAS
      A HARD TIME FOR US.
   - MAKING THE INVITE LIST.

          - OH, YEAH,
      THAT WAS VERY HARD.
         - WHO TO CUT.
   - YEAH, YEAH, IT WAS BOTH,
    SO WE CAN GO WITH THAT.

       - OKAY, BOBBI SUE.
  - I THINK I KNOW WHAT TRAVIS
       WOULD LIKE TO SAY,
       WHICH IS PROBABLY
           MY FAMILY,

   BUT THAT'S NOT AN OPTION,
     SO I'M GONNA ALSO SAY
    SPENDING ALL THAT MONEY.
    - SPENDING ALL THE MONEY
        ON THE WEDDING?

          - YEAH, THAT
     WAS PRETTY STRESSFUL.
          - ALL RIGHT,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
     MAKING THE INVITE LIST
        AND WHO TO CUT.

- YOU YELLED AT ME FOR INVITING
    PEOPLE YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
       - YEAH, BUT I HAD
      NO CHOICE ABOUT IT.
      YOU WERE GONNA DO IT
   REGARDLESS, SO IT WASN'T--

         - THAT'S TRUE.
             - OH!
  RACHEL, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
          - ALL RIGHT,
  IT WAS, LIKE, ALL THE TIME,

      "OH, I HAVE TO SPEND
     MONEY ON THIS, THIS."
    HE WAS LIKE, "WHY? WHY?
         YOU'RE CRAZY!"
         AND I'M, LIKE,
     "NO, IT'S MY WEDDING,

  AND YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND."
       SO I'M DEFINITELY
    GONNA SAY IT WAS MONEY.
     - OKAY, WHAT WOULD YOU
         SAY, JONATHAN?

         - I WOULD SAY
         IT WAS MONEY.
        - IT WAS MONEY!
             - YES!
            - YEAH!
         - YOU GOT IT.

       - YEAH. YOU ROCK.
     - OKAY, WAIT A MINUTE.
    WE HAVE A THREE-WAY TIE

        BETWEEN COUPLES
      ONE, TWO, AND THREE.
         THIS IS GREAT.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,

         AND THIS TIME,
 WE'RE GONNA DOUBLE THE POINTS,
        SO STAY WITH US.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
        IT IS YOUR TURN

   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
          HERE WE GO.

      WHEN YOUR HUSBAND'S
        PLAYING "POKER"
    WITH YOU IN THE BEDROOM,
         WOULD YOU SAY
        YOU NEVER BLUFF,

        SOMETIMES BLUFF,
          OR YOU BLUFF
    MUCH MORE THAN HE KNOWS?
     ALL RIGHT, BOBBI SUE?

        - I NEVER BLUFF
          WITH TRAVIS.
   HE DOESN'T GIVE ME A NEED,
       SO I NEVER BLUFF.
             - AHH.

         THERE YOU GO.
       ALL RIGHT, RACHEL,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
      - I SOMETIMES BLUFF.

    BUT I SOMETIMES WANT TO
   PLAY IT UP A LITTLE MORE.
           - BUT WHEN
      YOU PLAY IT UP MORE,
            IT JUST
    MAKES IT MORE EXCITING.

   - YEAH, IT'S A GOOD THING.
            - OKAY.
        GOT YOU. SARAH?
   - UM, I NEVER BLUFF ALSO.

          IT'S ALWAYS
        UNTIL I'M READY,
      AND THEN THAT'S IT.
     - AND THEN THAT'S IT.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
     WHAT IS THE LAST THING
    YOUR MAN WANTED SO BADLY
  THAT HE PRACTICALLY GOT DOWN
     ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES

       AND BEGGED FOR IT?
            RACHEL?
         - I WOULD SAY,
        HE REALLY WANTED

  TO GO TO THIS FOOTBALL GAME
        UP NORTH, SO...
      - AND HE PRACTICALLY
  GOT ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES?
         - YEAH, HE DID
      EVERYTHING HE COULD,

         BUT, YOU KNOW.
     - DID YOU LET HIM GO?
           - NO, WE--
       NO, WE DIDN'T GO.

      MAYBE IN THE FUTURE.
        - OKAY, GOT IT.
     SARAH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - UM, WELL, DAVE LITERALLY
   GOT ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES
        AND GOT A TRUCK,
          AND THAT WAS
       TO PROPOSE TO ME,

    HE BROUGHT A TRUCK HOME
      ALONG WITH THE RING,
    SO HE LITERALLY GOT DOWN
   ON HIS HANDS AND HIS KNEES
       AND PROPOSED TO ME
WITH HIS TRUCK IN THE DRIVEWAY,

      SO THAT'S SOMETHING
    THAT HE REALLY DID WANT
         AND HE GOT IT.
     - OKAY, THAT IS FUNNY.

           BOBBI SUE?
    - I THINK THE LAST TIME
  THAT HE BEGGED FOR SOMETHING
   WAS, UH, STEELERS TICKETS.

       I THINK THEY WERE
        IN THE PLAYOFFS,
     OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
       A SUPER BOWL GAME.
           - GOT YOU.

           ALL RIGHT,
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
          WHEN YOU TWO
       MOVED IN TOGETHER,
      WHAT'S THE ONE ITEM
YOUR HUSBAND DRAGGED IN THE DOOR

       THAT MADE YOU SAY,
           "OH, NO."
             SARAH?
     - UM, IT'S DEFINITELY
        HIS GIANTS GEAR.

        HE'S A BIG-TIME
      NEW YORK GIANTS FAN,
       AND HE PUTS IT UP
     R EVERY GIANTS GAME,
       AND IT'S ALL OVER
        THE LIVING ROOM.

       - IT'S EVERYWHERE?
     - YES, BUT I MAKE HIM
          PUT IT AWAY
        WHEN THE GIANTS
        AREN'T PLAYING.

       - [laughing] OKAY.
           BOBBI SUE?
       - THE STUFF THAT'S
      IN OUR APARTMENT NOW

         THAT MAKES ME
        ABSOLUTELY CRAZY
          IS HE FRAMES
        ALL THE TICKETS
       FOR THE BIG GAMES
        THAT HE GOES TO,

    AND SO, OUR LIVING ROOM
IS LIKE A SHRINE FOR PITTSBURGH,
     AND THEY COVER, LIKE,
        THE ENTIRE WALL.
    - SO, LIKE, NO PICTURES
   OF COUSINS, AUNTS, UNCLES?

        - HE PUTS THOSE
       NEAR THE BATHROOM.
           [laughter]
           - RACHEL?

  - YES, IT'S FOOTBALL AGAIN,
            AND IT'S
      FLORIDA GATOR GEAR.
      T-SHIRTS, FLAG, UM,
        A LICENSE PLATE.

        - [laughs] OKAY.
     ALL RIGHT, NOW HERE'S
      OUR BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS,
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.

          HERE WE GO.
            LADIES,
    HOW LONG DID IT TAKE YOU
             TO GET
    INTO YOUR WEDDING DRESS,

    AND HOW LONG DID IT TAKE
          YOUR HUSBAND
     TO GET YOU OUT OF IT?
           BOBBI SUE?

       - TO GET INTO IT,
 IT WAS PRETTY RELATIVELY EASY.
   I'LL SAY, LIKE, 20 MINUTES

    WHEN ALL THE TUGGING AND
 EVERYTHING WAS SAID AND DONE.
     AND TO GET OUT OF IT,
         IT WASN'T TILL
    THE NEXT MORNING THAT--

       - IT WASN'T UNTIL
       THE NEXT MORNING.
       - YEAH, WE TOOK--
        WE CONSUMMATED--
    THIS IS SO EMBARRASSING.

      - THE NEXT MORNING.
         THE NEXT DAY.
            - YEAH.
        - THE NEXT DAY.

         - WE KNEW THAT
       WAS GONNA HAPPEN,
         SO THERE WERE
       NO HARD FEELINGS.
        - OKAY, RACHEL?

    - YEAH, IT ONLY TOOK ME
       ABOUT TEN MINUTES
  TO PUT THE WEDDING DRESS ON.
        UM, IT WAS EASY,
         BUT BEAUTIFUL.

     BUT, UM, IT ONLY TOOK
ABOUT TWO MINUTES TO GET IT OFF,
       AND I WAS JUMPING
     OUT OF IT, TOO, SO...
          - OH, OKAY.

      AND WHAT ABOUT YOU,
             SARAH?
    - TEN MINUTES FOR BOTH.
      - ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

      ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU
        SO MUCH, LADIES.
  WHEN WE RETURN, WE WILL SEE
        IF THE HUSBANDS
           CAN MATCH

            BETWEEN

    SO IT IS ANYBODY'S GAME.

        HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
     GENTLEMEN, WHEN YOU'RE
        PLAYING "POKER"
         WITH YOUR WIFE
        IN THE BEDROOM,

          DID SHE SAY
       SHE NEVER BLUFFS,
       SOMETIMES BLUFFS,
           OR BLUFFS
    MUCH MORE THAN YOU KNOW?

            TRAVIS?
     - THAT'S AN EASY ONE.
       UH, NEVER BLUFFS.

         I ALWAYS KNOW
      WHEN, UH, BOBBI SUE
    IS READY TO DO WHATEVER
       SHE'S READY TO DO,
        SO I'M GONNA SAY
         NEVER BLUFFS.

    - ALL RIGHT, BOBBI SUE,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
        - NEVER BLUFFS.
            - WHOO.
            - NEVER.

   YOU DON'T GIVE ME A NEED.
            - OKAY.
           JONATHAN?

       - ALL RIGHT, WELL,
    THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.
        IN ALL HONESTY,
 I WOULD SAY SOMETIMES BLUFFS.
    - SHE SOMETIMES BLUFFS.

            - YEAH!
            YOU KNOW
       YOU ROCK MY WORLD.
     - YOU ROCK MINE, TOO.
          - LOVE YOU.

          - ALL RIGHT,
     DAVE, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
      - I KNOW FOR A FACT
    THAT SARAH NEVER BLUFFS.
        - AND WHY DO YOU
           KNOW THAT?

         - I DON'T WANT
        TO HAVE AN EGO,
           BUT I KNOW
       SHE NEVER BLUFFS.
      - ALL RIGHT, SARAH,
       DO YOU EVER BLUFF?

     [cheers and applause]
    YOU GUYS ARE STILL TIED.

     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
     WHAT'S THE LAST THING
      YOU WANTED SO BADLY
      THAT YOUR WIFE SAID

    YOU PRACTICALLY GOT DOWN
    ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES
       AND BEGGED FOR IT?
           JONATHAN?

  - I'M REALLY INTO SLURPEES.
        JUST BEING OPEN
        AND HONEST HERE.
         SO THAT'S WHAT
     I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY.

     - YOU REALLY, REALLY,
  REALLY WANTED THIS SLURPEE.
      - I REALLY, REALLY,
          REALLY DID.
   - DID YOU GET THE SLURPEE?

    - I BELIEVE I DID, YEAH.
- SO SHE GAVE YOU THAT SLURPEE.
             - YES.
  I MIGHT HAVE GONE BY MYSELF,
      BUT I STILL GOT IT.

          - [laughing]
     AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
             - AWW.

       - YOU WANTED TO GO
      TO A FOOTBALL GAME.
     - FOOTBALL GAME, BABE.
            - WHAT?
   - YEAH, YOU KNOW, I WOULD
   HAVE GOTTEN YOU A SLURPEE.

           - I THINK
    THAT SLURPEE WAS MORE--
          - SLURPEE'S
    MORE IMPORTANT FOR SURE.
     - OKAY, I GOT IT GOOD.
      I GOT IT REAL GOOD.

          - ALL RIGHT,
     WHAT DO YOU SAY, DAVE?
  - I WOULD SAY THE LAST THING
      THAT I BEGGED TO DO
    THAT SHE WANTED TO COME,

       BUT I DIDN'T HAVE
    ENOUGH TICKETS FOR HER,
       WAS PROBABLY GO TO
A NEW YORK GIANTS FOOTBALL GAME.
   - AND YOU BEGGED FOR THAT?

         - I BEGGED HER
      NOT TO LOCK THE DOOR
     AND LET ME GET BACK IN
   THAT NIGHT WHEN I GOT HOME
    WHEN SHE COULDN'T COME.

      - ALL RIGHT, SARAH,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - I SAID A TRUCK.
  - YOU BEGGED FOR THAT TRUCK,
         YOU REMEMBER?

 - I DIDN'T BEG FOR THE TRUCK.
 THAT'S HOW I PROPOSED TO HER.
          I BOUGHT IT
     BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED
      SO SHE COULDN'T SAY
       NOTHING ABOUT IT.

     - I SAID YOU LITERALLY
GOT DOWN ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES
        FOR THAT TRUCK.
     [cheers and applause]

        - YOU BOUGHT IT
  BEFORE YOU GUYS GOT MARRIED
        SO SHE COULDN'T
         SAY ANYTHING?
         - YEAH, WELL,
    IT WAS PART OF MY PLAN.

 I PUT THE, UH, ENGAGEMENT RING
       IN THE GLOVE BOX,
 LIKE, PULLED INTO THE DRIVEWAY
         FOR THE TRUCK,
       AND SHE WAS LIKE,
      "WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

    AIN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
  SAVING FOR SOMETHING ELSE?"
         AND I'M LIKE,
   "YEAH, HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?
   GO LOOK IN THE GLOVE BOX."

  SHE LOOKED IN THE GLOVE BOX,
         SHE DIDN'T SAY
 NOTHIN' ELSE ABOUT THE TRUCK.
      - THAT IS A GOOD WAY
           TO DO IT.

       - HE GOT ME, YEAH.
         - HE GOT YOU.
       ALL RIGHT, TRAVIS,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

      - I'M GONNA GO BACK
    A FEW YEARS AND SAY, UH,
           I'M A BIG
    PITTSBURGH STEELERS FAN,
    AND I WENT TO THE, UH...
        THE SUPER BOWL,

      UH, SUPER BOWL XLIII
   - WHAT DID BOBBI SUE SAY?
        YOU GOT TICKETS

  That's gonna be a hard score
 to beat if somebody gets her,

         with somebody
     namely Ralph Seguerra.
     If he gets over there,
   he's gonna beat the $750.
        Uh, Henry, um...

                           Yeah?
     just trying to think.
 I'm flashing on a conversation
     you said to me earlier
      the summer activity,

are you acting this summer
or you're just...
   Uh, no, I'm not actually.
   Uh, we finished "Webster"
           in March.

 We're about to start up again
  sometime in the near future.
          And, uh-uh,
 there are some other projects
     that are coming along.

      And I just came back
     a couple of weeks ago
   from Springfield, Illinois
       where I spent time
with the Abraham Lincoln folks.

         210,000 people
    came to the street there
          and happily,
    about a 110,000 knew me,
  it made me feel very happy.

What it does?
               But they knew me
                  from Pyramid.
Oh, I was trying to think
that were you in a play or some
that's what it was all about.
                          Yeah.

          In any case,
    good luck to you, folks.
So, Lauri, you're up
to a winning mark so far.
We'll start again with Ralph
and Vicki in a second.

And Vicki's new show,
I guess you call it a new show
though it's been around
a little while.

We have a day flight here
at the same time.
         I'll be back.
And you can count on Lauri
on being back here.
                   Oh, you bet.
$1,250. You have
a Tahiti trip though.
     Oh, great. Oh, can't wait.

     Think about it overnight.
     We'll see you tomorrow.
    For now, I'm Dick Clark.
            So long.
