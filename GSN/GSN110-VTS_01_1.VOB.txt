CONGRATULATIONS. HEY, FOLKS,

THE McCLAREN FAMILY GONNA PLAY
FAST MONEY. GIVE ME TWO
PLAYERS. LET'S GO NOW. WEIGHT.

SO SIMPLE, I NEVER THOUGHT OF
IT. WE'VE GOT SHELLY. WE GOT
JOE. WE GOING FOR THE CASH,

MAN, RIGHT AFTER THIS.
      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,

  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.

     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.

IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,

      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.

   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.

      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,

    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.

    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,

    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.

  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.

 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.

     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
        NEXT QUESTION--
      ACCORDING TO OPRAH,
         AN AHA! MOMENT
   IS WHEN SOMETHING HITS YOU
     LIKE A TON OF BRICKS.

    WHAT WAS THE AHA! MOMENT
     YOU HAD WITH YOUR WIFE
       WHEN YOU REALIZED
       YOU WERE IN LOVE?
              KEN?

 - NO, I JUST REMEMBER ONE TIME
    SHE CAME TO--TO MY WORK,
    AND SHE MADE ME DINNER,
   AND YOU KNOW, I NEVER HAD
   ANYBODY, YOU KNOW, GO OUT
OF THEIR WAY FOR ME TO DO THAT.

     UH, IT WAS JUST GREAT.
   IT WAS--YOU KNOW, SHE--SHE
     COOKED THE WHOLE MEAL,
 UM, JUST--JUST BECAUSE, SO...

  - OKAY. WHAT ABOUT YOU, JON?
       - UH, I WOULD SAY
  IT WAS PROBABLY AT A PARTY--
      WE MET IN COLLEGE...
           - MM-HMM.

 - AND JUST KIND OF SEEING HER
     FROM ACROSS THE ROOM,
  KICKING IT WITH HER FRIENDS
        AND EVERYTHING.
 THAT WAS PROBABLY THE MOMENT.

  I SAW THAT, YOU KNOW, OTHER
  PEOPLE APPRECIATED HER, TOO.
          IT WAS COOL.
          - AND, DAN?
   - PROBABLY THE FIRST NIGHT
        SHE STAYED OVER.

        WELL, SHE DIDN T
      ACTUALLY STAY OVER,
      BUT THE FIRST NIGHT
        WE, YOU KNOW...
           - MM-HMM.

 - SO THAT NIGHT, LIKE, THINGS
   WERE SAID THAT MADE ME GO,
         I REALLY THINK
    THIS COULD BE THE ONE.
   - AH. SO WHAT DID SHE SAY?

     - AS SHE WAS LEAVING,
    UH, YEAH,  THANK YOU FOR
   A LOVELY NIGHT,  LA LA LA,
  AND SHE SAID,  AND THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME SEE YOUR PENIS,

       AND THEN SHE LEFT.
             - OH!
       OH, THAT MUST HAVE
        MADE YOU HAPPY.
      - AND I--AND I WENT,
      THIS IS A FUN GIRL.

            - YEAH.
- SHE S GOT NO FILTER, SO I KNEW
THAT THAT WAS THE WOMAN FOR ME.
 - THANK YOU FOR SHARING THAT.
           ALL RIGHT.

IF THERE ARE DISHES IN THE SINK.

  SO YEAH, IF SHE DOESN T GET
          TO CLEAN UP,
    THEN THERE S A PROBLEM.
          - OKAY. DAN?
    - HAVE A CLEAN KITCHEN.

     - WHEN SHE DOESN T GET
    TO HAVE A CLEAN KITCHEN.
            - YEAH.

     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
       IS WORTH 5 POINTS,
    SO, LADIES, HERE WE GO.

   WHICH OF THESE PROFESSIONS
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
  YOU'RE MOST QUALIFIED FOR--
          A LIBRARIAN,
      A WAL-MART GREETER,

     OR A CARNIVAL BARKER?

              AMY?

     - UM, CARNIVAL BARKER?
       - SO ARE YOU LOUD?
         - LOUDER THAN
      A WAL-MART GREETER.

             - OH.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        CARNIVAL BARKER.
             - YAY!

   - [speaking indistinctly]
            - ERICA?
       - SOMETIMES I LIKE
        TO GO FOR IT...

          - ALL RIGHT.
  - BUT OTHER TIMES, YOU KNOW,
     WHEN--WHEN WE'RE DOING
      ROUTINE MAINTENANCE,
 IT'S JUST KIND OF, YOU KNOW...

    IT'S NOT THAT ANIMATED.
       - I LOVE IT. YEAH.
       - UM, I'M GONNA GO
     WITH CARNIVAL BARKER.
    - JON, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

       WAL-MART GREETER.
      - WAL-MART GREETER.
       - I SHOULD'VE GONE
     WITH MY FIRST ANSWER.
   - YEAH, THAT WOULD'VE BEEN
    YOUR ROUTINE MAINTENANCE

      KIND OF THING, YEAH.
        - YEAH, I KNOW.
- I HEAR YOU. ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
 THIS IS YOUR SECOND QUESTION.
      ACCORDING TO OPRAH,
         AN AHA! MOMENT

   IS WHEN SOMETHING HITS YOU
     LIKE A TON OF BRICKS.
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
      WAS THE AHA! MOMENT
    HE HAD WITH YOU, WHEN HE
    REALIZED HE WAS IN LOVE?

              AMY?
 - UH, I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, A--
   A MONTH BEFORE HE PROPOSED
      TO ME? I DON'T KNOW.

            - OKAY.
     KEN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - UH, WHEN SHE BROUGHT ME
         FOOD TO WORK.
             - OH!

       - WHEN YOU BROUGHT
      HIM DINNER AT WORK.
         - NOT SO MUCH.
            - ERICA?

    WHEN WE WERE IN COLLEGE.
  - WHEN YOU WERE IN COLLEGE.

  OKAY. JON, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  OH, AT A PARTY IN COLLEGE--
        ABSOLUTELY, YES.
    AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, SAM?

  - EARLY IN OUR RELATIONSHIP,
        I TOLD DAN THAT
     I WOULD NOT MARRY HIM
      UNLESS WE COULD HAVE
      A <i>STAR TREK</i> WEDDING,

AND I THINK THAT WAS THE MOMENT.
           I DON'T--
   - WHEN HE SAID--HE AGREED?
      - WELL, I JUST THINK
       HE KNEW RIGHT THEN
  THAT I WAS THE GIRL FOR HIM.

     - SO WHAT DID YOU SAY?
 FIRST NIGHT YOU "STAYED OVER."
             - OH.
        - "STAYED OVER."

            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
         OKAY, LADIES,

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
HELL HATH NO FURY LIKE MY WOMAN
 WHEN SHE DOESN'T GET TO BLANK.

             ERICA?
             - EAT?
 I CAN KIND OF BE, LIKE, UM...

  LIKE HE ALWAYS SAYS, "I NEED
   TO FEED YOU," YOU KNOW...
           - UH-HUH.
    - WHENEVER I GET CRANKY.
      - SO YOU GOTTA EAT.
             - YES.

            - OKAY.
     JON, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           WHEN YOU--
             - OH.
          - CLEANING.
 - YOU'RE RIGHT, YOU'RE RIGHT.

           I'M SORRY.
            - OKAY.
       - ALL RIGHT. SAM.
     - THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.

  I WOULD SAY WHEN I DON'T GET
  TO CLEAN UP RIGHT AFTER HIM
       WHILE HE'S COOKING
    WITH HIS BUTTER FINGERS
      ALL OVER THE STOVE.
        - OH. ALL RIGHT.

     DAN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        WE'LL TAKE THAT.
       - ALL RIGHT. YAY!
             - AMY?

           ALL RIGHT.

      BEFORE YOU TAMED IT,
         HOW MANY OTHER
     FAIR MAIDENS WRESTLED
      WITH YOUR HUSBAND'S
       LOCH NESS MONSTER?

              SAM?
      - I DON'T KNOW THAT
 I COULD EVEN COUNT THAT HIGH.
            - WHOO!

    DAN WAS OUT THERE, HUH?
           - HE WAS.
         - BEHIND THAT
     MILD MANNERED FACADE.
     - TOTALLY. WATCH OUT.
            - YEAH?

       - SO I'M GONNA GO
            WITH 20.
             - 20.
      - IT'S A SAFE GUESS.
            - OKAY.
     - PROBABLY NOT RIGHT.

- I HAVE A FEELING YOU GUYS ARE
  GONNA HAVE THAT CONVERSATION
      TONIGHT, BOY, YOU'RE
     GONNA FINISH THIS ONE.
   ALL RIGHT, SO YOU SAY 20.
      AMY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - I THINK THREE.
      - THREE, ALL RIGHT.
         - I THINK SO.
          - AND ERICA.
- I'M ALSO GONNA GO WITH THREE,

        'CAUSE THAT'S--
   FEELS LIKE A SAFE NUMBER.
         - WITH THREE.
         - YEAH, LIKE--
       - SAM IS OVER HERE
      LIKE, "OH, MY GOD."

       - WE'RE 40, OKAY,
     I'D JUST LIKE TO SAY.
    OLDER THAN 40, ACTUALLY.
       - SO YOU'RE LIKE,
    OKAY, IT'S JUST LIKE...

         - WE'VE LIVED.
    - HE'S LIVED, I GOT YOU.
   ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION,
            LADIES.
      IF YOU MADE A CLONE
        OF YOUR HUSBAND,

   HE'D BE EXACTLY THE SAME,
        BUT YOU'D TEACH
  THIS NEW VERSION TO DO WHAT?
              AMY?

- DEFINITELY PICK UP HIS SOCKS.
    - TO PICK UP HIS SOCKS.
      - JUST PICK 'EM UP.
      PUT 'EM IN THE WASH.
      - ALL RIGHT. ERICA?

   - CLEAN UP AFTER HIMSELF.
            - YEAH.
- I MEAN, HE--LIKE, HE LEAVES A
TRAIL WHEN HE COMES IN THE DOOR.
      IT'S, LIKE, I ALWAYS
     KNOW WHERE HE'S BEEN,

      BECAUSE THERE'S SOME
      ARTICLE OF CLOTHING,
       OR SOMETHING THAT
      HE'S BEEN EATING...
           - UH-HUH.
        - OR SOMETHING.

    HE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.
     - ALL RIGHT, AND, SAM?
    - I WOULD TEACH HIM TO--
     TO NOT LEAVE HIS CUPS
      ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

   - EVERYBODY SAID CLEANING.
      I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS
  ALL HAVE A CLEANING SERVICE.
   THEY ARE JUST NOT MEETING
      UP TO YOUR STANDARDS

    WITH THE CLEANING, HUH?
     I HEAR YOU. ALL RIGHT,
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.
    DURING HIS SINGLE YEARS,

     WHAT MADE YOUR HUSBAND
      STAND OUT THE MOST--
     HIS LOOKS, HIS CHARM,
        OR HIS FLIRTING?
             ERICA?

    - DEFINITELY HIS CHARM.
      HE'S--HE'S SO WITTY
        AND INTELLIGENT
     AND JUST A GREAT GUY.

          - OKAY. SAM?
   - I ALSO THINK HIS CHARM.
            HE IS--

    HE'S THE PERFECT AMOUNT
      OF FUNNY AND SILLY,
 AND HE KNOWS WHEN TO TURN THAT
  OFF, TOO, SO CHARM FOR SURE.
       - ALL RIGHT. AMY?

   - I'M GONNA GO WITH CHARM
AS WELL. HE'S GOT A GREAT LAUGH.
      EVERYBODY HEARS IT,
  AND EVERYBODY FOLLOWS ALONG.
      THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW
   WHAT THEY'RE LAUGHING AT.

  - OH, THAT'S GREAT. ALL YOUR
   HUSBANDS ARE SO CHARMING,
         BUT THEY CAN'T
      PICK UP THEIR SOCKS
         AND PUT A CUP
    BACK ON THE TABLE, HUH?

         OKAY, LADIES,
   HERE'S THE BONUS QUESTION.
        IT HAS 2 PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--

      IF WE THREW A PARTY
    FOR MY HUSBAND'S FAMILY,
   THERE'D BE NO NEED TO BUY
         SUGAR OR NUTS,
  BECAUSE BLANK WOULD PROVIDE
         THE SWEETNESS,

           AND BLANK
        IS ALREADY NUTS.
           [laughter]
        - OH, BOY, OKAY.
             - SAM?

    - HEATHER WOULD PROVIDE
         THE SWEETNESS.
      - AND WHO'S HEATHER?
 - HEATHER IS MY SISTER-IN-LAW,
         DAN'S SISTER.

            - OKAY.
    - AND SO THE NUTS, HUH?
           - MM-HMM.
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH
        HIS UNCLE STEVE.

       - HIS UNCLE STEVE.
 - UNCLE STEVE. A LITTLE NUTTY.
            - OKAY.
    NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU, AMY?
   - UM, HIS GRANDMOTHER NAN
   WOULD BRING THE SWEETNESS.

  - I HAVE TO SAY HIS BROTHER
     WOULD BRING THE NUTS.
    HE'S NUTS IN A GOOD WAY.
          HE'S CRAZY,

     GETS EVERYBODY CRAZY,
AND JUST TELLS JOKE AFTER JOKE.
       - WHAT'S HIS NAME?
            - TOMMY.
             - YES.

         - OKAY. ERICA.
 - OKAY, UM, CERTAINLY, HIS MOM
   WOULD BRING THE SWEETNESS.
         SHE'S AMAZING.

 SHE'S JUST SO LOVING AND WARM
            AND, UM,
  THE DEFINITION OF SWEETNESS.
 - WHAT'S YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW'S
             NAME?

            - SUSAN.
      - SUSAN, ALL RIGHT.
     - UM, THE NUTS PART--
  I WOULD SAY HIS AUNT KAREN,

         BUT NOT NUTS,
    BECAUSE SHE'S NOT NUTS,
      BUT, YOU KNOW, NUTS
    BECAUSE SHE'S HILARIOUS,
   AND SHE BRINGS THE PARTY.

     - OKAY, SO SHE BRINGS
       THE PARTY. KAREN.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

        - OKAY, THE GUYS
        ARE BACK TO SEE
 IF THEY CAN MATCH THE ANSWERS
       THEIR WIVES GAVE.
  SO, FELLAS, HERE'S THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.

      BEFORE SHE TAMED IT,
  HOW MANY OTHER FAIR MAIDENS
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
         WRESTLED WITH
    YOUR LOCH NESS MONSTER?

              DAN?
        DO YOU EVEN KNOW
       THAT ANSWER, DAN?
       - OH, YEAH, I DO.
          - OH, OKAY.

     - I GOT A LIST I KEEP.
        - OH, HMM, OKAY.
  - UM, I THINK SHE SAID TEN.
- OKAY, SO YOU SAID THAT'S WHAT
 YOU THINK SHE WOULD HAVE SAID.

   WHAT--WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
   - I DON'T THINK THAT'S ANY
   OF YOUR BUSINESS, SHERRI.
  - WHOA, OH, NO. NO, NO, NO.

     YOU CAN'T COME AND SAY
   IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.
     YOU CAME ON THIS SHOW
 SO YOU CAN REVEAL SOME STUFF.
   LIKE, IS IT MORE THAN 15?
      - IT'S MORE THAN 15.

     - IS IT MORE THAN 20?
  - A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN 20.
        - IS IT, LIKE--
        IS IT LIKE, 22--
 - I GOT MARRIED LATE IN LIFE,
     AND YOU CAN'T JUDGE--

    DON'T JUDGE ME, SHERRI.
        YOU CAN'T JUDGE.
     - I'M NOT JUDGING YOU,
   'CAUSE I'M UP THERE, TOO.
   I'M UP THERE--WE CAN ALL--
     NOW HAVE WE ALL LIVED?

    WE HAVE ALL LIVED, DAN.
        ALL RIGHT, SAM,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          SAM SAID 20.

    - I SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED
            MY BABY.
     - CLOSE--I WAS CLOSE.
  - OKAY, KEN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - I GUESS ON MY BEHALF,
 WE GOT MARRIED EARLY IN LIFE,
      SO I'LL GO WITH TWO.
    - AMY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
             THREE.
           - OH. HMM.

              AW.
        - DON'T SAY TWO.
     - WHEN IN DOUBT ABOUT
      OTHER SEX PARTNERS,
   JUST THROW ANOTHER ONE IN.

  IT'S BETTER TO THROW ONE IN
  THAN TO BE--TO DO IT UNDER.
           OKAY. JON?
       - SO BEFORE, OKAY.

         ALL RIGHT, UH,
    I'M GONNA GO WITH THREE.
         - WITH THREE.
     YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY,
     BECAUSE YOU WENT BE--

     "OKAY, THAT'S BEFORE."
     BUT WHAT ABOUT AFTER?
      - OH, NO--I MEANT...
           [laughter]

        - I JUST PICK UP
      ON STUFF LIKE THAT.
     SO YOU SAID HOW MANY?
            - THREE.
  THREE--I'M GOING WITH THREE.
       - YOU SAID THREE.

             OKAY.
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, ERICA?
            - THREE.
            - THREE!
      ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,

         NEXT QUESTION.
   IF YOUR WIFE MADE A CLONE
            OF YOU,
   HE'D BE EXACTLY THE SAME,

    BUT SHE SAID SHE'D TEACH
        THIS NEW VERSION
        TO DO WHAT? KEN?
     - I'LL HAVE TO GO BACK
   TO CLEANING AFTER MYSELF.

- SO SPECIFICALLY, WHAT KIND OF
  CLEANING UP AFTER YOURSELF?
   - WE'LL GO WITH THE SOCKS
          FROM BEFORE,
     'CAUSE SHE WAS REALLY,
    REALLY UPSET WITH THAT.

       - ALL RIGHT, AMY,
        IS IT THE SOCKS?
       - IT'S THE SOCKS.
      - IT'S THOSE SOCKS.
          - GOOD JOB.

             - JON.
         - I'M A SLOB,
AND WHEN I COME HOME, YOU KNOW,

     I TAKE OFF ONE ARTICLE
          OF CLOTHING,
  THERE'S A TRAIL ALL THE WAY
         TO THE COUCH.
         I'M GONNA SAY
      PICK UP MY CLOTHES.

 - SO AS YOU COME IN THE DOOR,
YOU JUST START REMOVING CLOTHING
        AND DROPPING IT?
  - OH, YEAH, IT'S LIKE A HAT,
 SHOES, PANTS, EVERYTHING. SHE
 KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE I'VE BEEN,

   AND I STOP AT THE FRIDGE--
           ALL OF IT.
   - ERICA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  CLEANING UP AFTER YOURSELF.

             - DAN?
   - I'M RELATIVELY CONFIDENT
       THAT SHE ALSO SAID
   CLEANING UP AFTER MYSELF.

         IN PARTICULAR,
    SHE MIGHT HAVE MENTIONED
     LEAVING EMPTY GLASSES
       AROUND THE HOUSE.
       - OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
  AND, SAM, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

   NOT LEAVING CUPS ALL OVER.
        ABSOLUTELY, YES.
    - YAY! WE CAN CELEBRATE.

        - YES, YES, YES.
          - NICE WORK.
        - THERE YOU GO.
        OKAY, HUSBANDS,
   HERE'S OUR NEXT QUESTION.

   DURING YOUR SINGLE YEARS,
 WHAT DID YOU WIFE SAY MADE YOU
      STAND OUT THE MOST--
    YOUR CHARM, YOUR LOOKS,

       OR YOUR FLIRTING?
              JON?
 - DEFINITELY NOT MY FLIRTING.

 - HOW'S YOUR FLIRTING SKILLS?
      - THEY'RE HORRIBLE.
            - YEAH.
   - HORRIBLE, YEAH, LIKE...

           [laughter]
       - CHARM, I GUESS.
         - YOUR CHARM?
            - YEAH.

- THINK YOU'RE REALLY CHARMING?
      - ERICA? YOUR CHARM.
             - DAN?

      - I THINK SHE MIGHT
        HAVE SAID CHARM.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT DID YOU SAY, SAM?
            - CHARM.

       - YAY! NICE WORK!
     - ALL RIGHT. AND KEN?
     - WELL, I'M DEFINITELY
         NOT CHARMING,

       AND I'M GONNA HAVE
      TO AGREE WITH HIM--
     - YOU'RE NOT CHARMING?
 - NO. YOU THINK I'M CHARMING?
           COME ON...
          - I THINK--

      I ABSOLUTELY THOUGHT
       YOU WERE CHARMING.
     - OH, WELL, THEN I'LL
         GET IT WRONG,
      'CAUSE I'M GONNA GO
         WITH MY LOOKS.

    - YOUR LOOKS, ALL RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
    - WHAT DID YOU SAY, AMY?
      SHE SAID YOUR CHARM.
        - AW, MY CHARM?

      - YOU MAKE ME LAUGH
         ALL THE TIME.
        - THAT'S CHARM?
   - MORE SO THAN THE OTHERS.
     - ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.
