     I NEVER THOUGHT TO USE
    ASPIRIRIN FOR MUSCLE PAIN.

      BUT I TESTED IT OUT,
   AND Bayer Advanced Aspirin
     RELIEVED MY PAIN FAST.
           IT HELPS ME
      GET BACK IN THE GAME.

BUT DON'T TAKE HIS WORD
       FOR IT.
   PUT Bayer Advanced Aspirin
    TO THE TEST FOR YOURSELF

        GO TO YOU, DAN.
   - I-I THINK SHE MIGHT SAY
   MY MOM FOR THE SWEETNESS.

          - ALL RIGHT.
      - I THINK SHE MIGHT
       HAVE SAID MY DAD.
   - ALL RIGHT, SO YOUR MOM'S
     SWEET, YOUR DAD NUTS?

     AND, UH, MY AUNT KAREN
       WOULD BE THE NUTS,
   IF I GOTTA PICK SOMEBODY,
             SORRY.
      - ALL RIGHT, SO YOU
     ONLY NEED ONE TO WIN.

    ERICA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

       HELLO, AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
         HELLO, FELLAS.
      all: HELLO, SHERRI.
   - WELL, THIS IS SO GREAT,

      BECAUSE WE HAVE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
          WE WILL GET
     RIGHT INTO IT, FELLAS.

   IS THE MOST PRIVATE THING
    YOU HAVE IN YOUR BEDROOM
 HIDDEN IN ONE OF YOUR DRAWERS,
  ONE OF YOUR WIFE'S DRAWERS,

OR SOMEWHERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT?
           - [laughs]
     - YOU LAUGHED, THOMAS.
              WHY?
      - UH, NO, IT--IT'S--
     IT'S DEFINITELY HIDDEN

     IN ONE OF MY DRAWERS.
            - OKAY.
  - IT'S ON MY SIDE OF THE BED
       WHERE I CAN GET IT
        WHEN I NEED IT.

    - FOR EASY ACCESS, HUH?
    - FOR EASY ACCESS, YEAH.
         - OKAY. JOHN.
 - I'D SAY IT'S ON MY WIFE'S--
  IN ONE OF MY WIFE'S DRAWERS.

   - OKAY. SO DOES THAT MEAN
      SHE WOULD INITIATE?
         - UH, PERHAPS.
            - OKAY.
     WHAT ABOUT YOU, ERIC?

  - UM, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
SOMEWHERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT,
    UM, BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY
      HAVEN'T PUT IT AWAY.
             - OH!
           [laughter]

          - [laughing]
          - ALL RIGHT.
         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
     IF A BUMP ON THE HEAD
        GAVE ME AMNESIA

         AND I COULDN'T
       RECOGNIZE MY WIFE,
       IT WOULD ALL COME
      FLOODING BACK TO ME
     AS SOON AS I HEARD HER
           SAY BLANK.

             JOHN.
            - "RAT."
  - AS SOON AS SHE SAID "RAT."
      - KIND OF A PET NAME
    WE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER,

        SO, UM, I'D SAY
   IF SHE SAID "RAT," I WOULD
   DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE HER.
            - ERIC.
    - I'M GONNA SAY "AVERY."

            - AVERY?
  - HE'S OUR 11-MONTH-OLD SON.
             - OH.
            all: AW.
     - AND I'M SURE AS SOON
     AS SHE SAID HIS NAME,

        EVERYTHING WOULD
        COME RIGHT BACK.
        - OKAY. THOMAS.
      - UM, ODDLY ENOUGH,
      I THINK IT WOULD BE

          IF SHE SAID,
     "DON'T YOU REMEMBER?"
           - [laughs]
   - UM, I DON'T WANT TO SAY
     I HAVE MEMORY ISSUES.
            - YEAH.

     - BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
        A LOT OF STUFF.
 - YEAH. "DON'T YOU REMEMBER?"
       HUSBANDS, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.

   WHEN YOU AND YOUR WIFE ARE
 HAVING TEATIME IN THE BEDROOM,
      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
         YOUR WIFE DOES
       THAT LETS YOU KNOW
  HER KETTLE IS ABOUT TO BOIL?

             ERIC.
     - SHE RUBS HER FINGERS
          UP MY BACK.
            - OKAY.
           - [laughs]

       - AND EVERYTHING'S
  RIGHT OUT THERE IN THE OPEN,
   SO NO WAITING, ALL RIGHT.
         - ABSOLUTELY.
           - THOMAS.
    - UM, SHE LOVES MY HAIR,

     SO SHE'LL GRAB MY HAIR
       REAL TIGHT, YEAH.
 - SO YOU COULD JUST BE SITTING
       THERE WATCHING TV,
 AND ONCE SHE YANKS YOUR HAIR,
            IT'S ON.

           - IT'S ON.
            - OKAY.
           [laughter]
      ALL RIGHT. [laughs]
             JOHN.

         - UH, I'LL SAY
      SHE'LL JUST TELL ME.
  - SHE'LL JUST LET YOU KNOW.
            - YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
      THANK YOU, NICE JOB.

       I HOPE YOUR WIVES

        WELCOME, LADIES.
     I SEE BY YOUR SMILES,
    YOU'RE HAPPY TO BE HERE.
          women: YES.

      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
THE MOST PRIVATE THING YOU HAVE
  IN YOUR BEDROOM IS HIDDEN IN
      ONE OF YOUR DRAWERS,
      ONE OF HIS DRAWERS,

OR SOMEWHERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT?
            VALARIE.
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO

    WITH ONE OF HIS DRAWERS.
    I THINK WE TRY AND KEEP
       EVERYTHING HIDDEN
    ON HIS SIDE OF THE BED,
        AND HIS DRAWERS

  ARE ON HIS SIDE OF THE BED.
 - WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS?
       - SOME LOVELY TOYS
    WE MAY HAVE BOUGHT OR...
 - WHAT'S SO LOVELY ABOUT 'EM?
           - [laughs]

  THEY'RE SPARKLY AND PINK...
    - SPARKLIES AND PINK...
      - AND PRETTY COLORS.
  - AND REALLY PRETTY COLORS.
        - YEAH, MM-HMM.
   - THOMAS, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

        IN HIS DRAWERS.
      - ONE OF MY DRAWERS.
             - YES!
     [cheers and applause]
          - OH, I CAN?
          - [laughing]

        - NO, I'M NICE!
          - ALL RIGHT.
  AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, ALISON?
 - I'M GONNA SAY IN MY DRAWER,
  UM, BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE

  WHO HAS A PROPER NIGHTSTAND.
  WE ONLY HAVE ONE NIGHTSTAND.
            - OKAY.
   - I GET IT. I'M THE GIRL.
- SO WHAT--WHAT TYPES OF THINGS
       ARE IN THE DRAWER?

         - UM, PINK...
             - OH.
      - A LITTLE SPARKLES.
   - A LOT OF PINK SPARKLIES
           OVER HERE.
            - YEAH.

 - PINK AND SPARKLY, ALL RIGHT.
    JOHN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  IN ONE OF MY WIFE'S DRAWERS.
            - YEAH.
             - YAY!

     [cheers and applause]
            - LISA.
        - I'M GONNA SAY
      ONE OF HIS DRAWERS.

   - ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR?
      - UH, BUNGEE CORDS.
        - BUNGEE CORDS.
           [laughter]
         WHAT DO YOU DO
      WITH A BUNGEE CORD?

- OH, WE GET A LITTLE CREATIVE.
        I GET CREATIVE.
   - A LITTLE CREATIVE, HUH?
           - [laughs]
          - HUH! WOW.

   ERIC, YOU'RE JUST SMILING.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
  SOMEWHERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
            - WHAT?
     - THEY'RE NOT PUT AWAY
           RIGHT NOW.

- YEAH, BUT THEY ARE--NORMALLY,
    THEY'RE IN YOUR DRAWER.
- NO, 'CAUSE SHE SAID RIGHT NOW.
        - NEXT QUESTION,
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

     IF A BUMP ON THE HEAD
        GAVE ME AMNESIA
         AND I COULDN'T
       RECOGNIZE MY WIFE,
       IT WOULD ALL COME
  FLOODING BACK TO ME AS SOON

   AS I HEARD HER SAY BLANK.
            ALISON.
     - I WOULD PROBABLY SAY
   "CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF,"
   BECAUSE HE LEAVES A TRAIL
   OF HIS THINGS EVERYWHERE,

   AND I'M KIND OF LIKE, "OH,
  PICK THAT UP, PICK THAT UP."
           SO I'D SAY
   "CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF."
    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, JOHN?
             "RAT."

           - [laughs]
      - YOUR NAME FOR HIM.
            - YEAH.
    - WE DO SAY "RAT" A LOT.

- IT'S VERY ENDEARING, ISN'T IT?
           - I KNOW.
            - YEAH.
  IT CERTAINLY GETS ME GOING.
     - [laughs] ALL RIGHT.

     LISA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - UM, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
        "ARE YOU PLAYING
       THE GAME TONIGHT?"

   "ARE YOU PLAYING THE GAME
           TONIGHT?"
            - YEAH.
   - SO WHAT'D YOU SAY, ERIC?
            "AVERY."

             - HUH?
- AND IT WOULD ALL COME FLOODING
          BACK TO HIM.
 - OH, THAT'S SWEET BUT WRONG.
    - [laughs] GOOD ANSWER.

           [laughter]
             - OHH.
        'CAUSE AVERY IS
   YOUR 11 MONTH OLD, RIGHT?

         - YES, HE IS.
            - OKAY.
           ALL RIGHT.
  NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU, VALARIE?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
  "THANKS FOR BEING ON TIME."

     IT WAS THE FIRST THING
      HE EVER SAID TO ME.
    UM, WE WERE MEETING, UM,
            FOR, UH,
   THIS AFTER-SCHOOL THING...

           - MM-HMM.
      - AND "AFTER-SCHOOL"
         BEING COLLEGE,
      AND HE--I WAS LATE,
    AND HE LOOKED UP AT ME--
  I'VE NEVER MET HIM BEFORE--

          AND HE SAID,
  "THANKS FOR BEING ON TIME."
           [laughter]
            - SO...
   - THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.

 - [laughs] ALL RIGHT, THOMAS,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - DO YOU REMEMBER?
    - "DON'T YOU REMEMBER?"
        - OH. WHAT IS--
   - I ALWAYS FORGET THINGS.

             - OH.
- IT'S LIKE AMNESIA, FORGETTING.
   - OH, AMNESIA, FORGETTING.
 OH, OKAY, I GET IT. I GET IT.
   I GET WHERE YOUR MIND WAS.

    I MEAN, IT'S NOT RIGHT,
 BUT I GET WHERE YOUR MIND WAS.
           - [laughs]
       ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.

 WHEN YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND ARE
 HAVING TEATIME IN THE BEDROOM,
      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
         HE SAID YOU DO
        TO LET HIM KNOW
 YOUR KETTLE IS ABOUT TO BOIL?

             LISA.
    - I GUESS I KIND OF GO,
           "OH! OH."
             - OH.
          - [cheering]

    [laughter and applause]
       - THAT NOISE, HUH?
            - YEAH.
        - AND HE KNOWS.

  ERIC, WHAT ABOUT THAT NOISE?
      YOU RUN YOUR FINGERS
          UP HIS BACK.
          - OH, OKAY.

           EH, OKAY.
           - [laughs]
   - ERIC, THAT'D BE SO COOL.
  CAN YOU MAKE THE SAME SOUND?
 - ACTUALLY, I'M PRETTY SILENT.
    - YOU'RE PRETTY SILENT?

        - UH, I'M JUST--
    I'M JUST GETTING IT ON.
           - [laughs]
   YOU'RE JUST GROOVIN', HUH?
     [cheers and applause]

     - ALL RIGHT, VALARIE.
  - [laughs] I'M USUALLY LIKE,
         "OH, MY GOD."
    I'LL SAY, "OH, MY GOD."

  - THAT'S THE WAY YOU SAY IT?
- YEAH, WELL, NO, I MEAN, THAT'S
   NOT--OKAY, I'LL BE LIKE...
[gasps] "OH, MY GOD," LIKE THAT.
             - OH.
           [laughter]

            - YEAH.
      - THAT'S VERY NICE.
             - YES.
     - WOW, LOOK AT THOMAS.
             YEAH.
    THOMAS, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

      - YOU GRAB MY HAIR.
     - OH! FAIL, YES, I DO
         DO THAT, TOO.
           - [laughs]
 - IT'S ALL IN THE SAME MOTION.

  IT'S AN, "OH, MY GOD," WITH
 THE GRABBING OF THE HAIR, YES.
        - ONE BIG--YEAH.
        - OKAY, CORRECT.
- [laughs] AND WHAT DO YOU SAY,
         THEN, THOMAS?

  "THANKS FOR BEING ON TIME"?
           - [laughs]
           [laughter]
             - YES.
          - [cheering]
          - [laughing]

             WHOO!
           ALL RIGHT.
            ALISON.

        - OKAY, I THINK
           I USUALLY,
  I'M PRETTY STRAIGHTFORWARD.
  I'LL SAY, "I'M ALMOST THERE,
      I'M GONNA... SOON."

            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.
         - YOU'RE JUST
    REALLY STRAIGHTFORWARD.
        - YEAH, I JUST--
   JUST TELL HIM LIKE IT IS.

         - OKAY. OKAY.
   IT'S SO FUNNY YOU SAY IT.
      IT SOUNDS JUST LIKE
      A NAVIGATION SYSTEM.
        I'M JUST SAYIN'.
         - TURN RIGHT.

          - ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, JOHN?
      TELL--YOU TELL HIM.
            - YEAH!
            - YEAH.
            - MWAH.

          NICE GOING.
          - GOOD JOB!
       - OKAY, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.
        JOHN AND ALISON,

      YOU ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 10 POINTS.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,
    AND POINTS ARE DOUBLED.

          STAY TUNED.
    SOME PLACES LIKE TO TALK
    ABOUT BILLIONS SERVED
     [cheers and applause]
   AT WENDY'S, WE NEVER GAVE

 MUCH THOUGHT TO THE BILLIONS.

  - OKAY, HERE WE GO. LADIES,
  IT'S ALL ABOUT PERSPECTIVE.
 SO WHAT WAS THE CRAZIEST THING

  WAS IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
       HE DID IN PUBLIC,
        IN THE KITCHEN,
       OR IN THE BEDROOM?

        - UM, IN PUBLIC.
        - WHAT'D HE DO?

        - [chuckles] OH.

             LISA.
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
      WITH IN THE KITCHEN.
           - MM-HMM.
 - BECAUSE WE JUST HAD A FIGHT,

  AND HE HAS, LIKE, A BIG EGO.
           - UH-HUH.
      - SO HE CAN'T ADMIT
        THAT HE'S WRONG,
    SO HE, LIKE, GETS REALLY
  SILENT AND NASTY SOMETIMES,

    BUT I LOVE HIM ANYWAYS.
            - YEAH.
  - SO I'D SAY IN THE KITCHEN.
   - IN THE KITCHEN. VALARIE.

         - YEAH, HE HAS
      A CUTE LITTLE BUTT.
        - OKAY. VALARIE.
 - UM, I'M GOING WITH HIS HAIR.
        I LOVE HIS HAIR.

     IT'S SO CUTE AND CURLY
   AND JUST CUTE AS A BUTTON.
            - OKAY.
      - CUTE AS A BUTTON.
           - ALISON.
 - I'M GONNA GO WITH HIS EYES.

   I WOULD KILL FOR HIS EYES.
         THEY'RE BLUE.

 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE.

   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.

        HUSBANDS, GUYS,
  IT'S ALL ABOUT PERSPECTIVE.
   SO WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY
     WAS THE CRAZIEST THING
 SHE'S EVER HAD A GREAT VIEW OF

     WHILE DOING THE NASTY?
            THOMAS.
           - MY EYES.

          - OH, OKAY.
SO WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE NASTY,
THEN SHE ONLY HAS EYES FOR YOU.

        - THAT'S RIGHT.
            - OKAY.
           [laughter]
           I GOT IT.
    VALARIE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

 SHE SAID THE OCEAN IN BRAZIL.
      - I MEAN, YOUR EYES
 ARE GORGEOUS, BUT I MEAN, BAM.
  - THAT'S ALSO A GREAT VIEW.
       - OCEAN IN BRAZIL.

            - JOHN.
   - I'LL SAY A SWIMMING HOLE
           IN HAWAII.
      - THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
- YEAH, IT WAS ON OUR HONEYMOON,

  AND WE HAD A LITTLE PRIVACY
   IN A VERY SECLUDED PLACE,
          AND IT WAS--
      IT WAS A GOOD TIME.
        - OKAY. ALISON.

    THE WATERFALL IN HAWAII.
            - YEAH!
            - MWAH!
           OF COURSE.
            - YEAH.

        ALL RIGHT, ERIC.
    - UH, ONE TIME, A COYOTE
    CAME INTO OUR BACKYARD.
 - [laughing] IN THE BACKYARD?
            - YEAH.

- SO YOU GOT THE COYOTE HOWLING.

        - WHAT HAPPENED?

 I DIDN'T EAT ANY FOOD ALL DAY,

       AND THEN I WENT...
  - ONE BEER TURNED INTO TEN.

IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE BEDROOM,
      BECAUSE I NEVER HAVE
     TO BE SORRY FOR THAT.

      SAYING YOU'RE SORRY.

       MNH-MNH, NOT YOU.
           - [laughs]
 - ALL RIGHT, SO THAT KITCHEN.
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, LISA?
        IN THE KITCHEN.
         - YEAH. MWAH!

- UM, IT'S DEFINITELY IN PUBLIC.

   - DOES THIS--THINGS HAPPEN
      IN PUBLIC FREQUENTLY
     WHERE YOU HAVE TO SAY
         YOU'RE SORRY?
     - THEY DON'T--IT'S NOT
  LIKE AN EVENT THAT HAPPENS,

        - OKAY, VALARIE.

             - OH.
  WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IN PUBLIC?
       - IN THE KITCHEN?
  - YOU DON'T REMEMBER THINGS.

 SO WHAT IS THIS THAT HAPPENED
           IN PUBLIC?
     WE'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING
        IN THE KITCHEN.
    AND WE'RE FIGHTING NOW.

  - IT ENDS UP IN THE KITCHEN.
    FROM--FROM THE PUBLIC...
       - FROM THE PUBLIC.
  - IT MOVES INTO THE KITCHEN.
   - INTO THE KITCHEN, OKAY.

         YOU ARE GOING
      TO PUERTO VALLARTA.
      AND A SPECIAL THANKS

      ALL RIGHT, SO, ERIC,
 YOU CAN DO YOUR LITTLE "OHH!"

      IN PUERTO VALLARTA!
            [laughs]
  THAT'S OUR SHOW, EVERYBODY.
     THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
  <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i> GOOD NIGHT!

          DID YOU KNOW
     THAT IN PENNSYLVANIA,
      IT'S AGAINST THE LAW
      FOR A BRIDE OR GROOM
         TO GET MARRIED
      WHILE THEY'RE DRUNK?

       I GUESS THAT'S WHY
      THEY INVENTED VEGAS.
 HERE ARE TONIGHT'S NEWLYWEDS.
      ON THEIR FIRST DATE,
    THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST.

       I GUESS SHE LIKED
  HOW HE HANDLED HIS SAUSAGE.
      MEET MATT AND HEIDI.
       AT THEIR WEDDING,
   HER FATHER SURPRISED THEM

  WITH A BIG JUG OF MOONSHINE.
 NOW THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WON'T
    FIND ON MOST REGISTRIES.
   HERE ARE ANDREW AND TARA.

      AND HIS WIFE IS TINY
        BUT EATS A LOT,
 SO HE CALLS HER "SKINNY PIG."
    ATTENTION, MALE VIEWERS,
    DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.

 WELCOME JERMAINE AND JENNIFER.
 LET'S PLAY <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
         [upbeat music]

  Captioning provided by GSN.
            - HELLO!
         HI, EVERYBODY.

       HELLO, AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
  FELLAS, HOW ARE YOU TONIGHT?
         - GOOD. GOOD.
        - ARE YOU READY?
   - I CAN'T WAIT. LET'S GO.

- OKAY. WELL, WE SENT YOUR WIVES
  BACKSTAGE SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
 WE'RE GONNA GET RIGHT INTO IT.
           GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS OUR FIRST QUESTION.

  IF YOU AND YOUR WIFE PLAYED
    SEVEN MINUTES IN HEAVEN
AT YOUR NORMAL LOVEMAKING PACE,
 BY THE TIME THE CLOCK RAN OUT,

    WOULD YOU BE WARMING UP,
      IN THE ACT, OR DONE?
             MATT.

             - WOW.
       UM, I'M GONNA SAY,
   UM, HOW ABOUT WARMING UP?

      - ALL RIGHT. ANDREW.
   - I WOULD ALSO HAVE TO SAY
          WARMING UP.
         - WARMING UP.
            - YEAH.

          - JERMAINE.
  - I'M GONNA SAY IN THE ACT.
  - NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN,
           ALL RIGHT.
       SURE, YOUR WIFE'S
        A GOOD GIRL NOW,

 BUT WHAT'S ONE BAD-GIRL HABIT
 SHE KICKED BEFORE SHE MET YOU?
            ANDREW.
   - SHE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
      A LOT OF BAD HABITS,

      AND I THINK THE ONES
  THAT SHE HAS, SHE STILL HAS.
       UM [laughs] UH...
   - SO SHE DIDN'T KICK ANY.
            - YEAH.
EATING BAD FOOD, I WOULD--YEAH.

       - OKAY. JERMAINE.
         - WHEN MY WIFE
      USED TO GO TO BARS,
        SHE WOULD--SHE--

 LET'S SAY SHE WENT TO THE BAR
          WITH $20...
            - OKAY.
- SHE WOULD COME HOME WITH $20.
             - OH.

     - SHE WOULD MAKE GUYS
   BUY HER DRINKS ALL NIGHT.
   SHE WAS VERY GOOD AT THAT.
 - THAT DON'T SOUND LIKE A BAD
 HABIT TO ME, LADIES, DOES IT?

BUT FOR YOU, IT'S LIKE, UNH-UNH.
    FOR GUYS, IT'S NOT GOOD.
            - RIGHT.
         - OKAY. MATT.
  - WELL, MY WIFE IS SMOKIN',

 BUT I THINK ONE OF THE HABITS
   SHE DOES NOT HAVE ANYMORE,
       SHE DOESN'T SMOKE,
 SO I'M GONNA GO WITH SMOKING.
           - [laughs]

     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
       COMPLETE THIS POST
    TO YOUR TWITTER ACCOUNT.
   I'M AT <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME </i>
  <i>JUST WAITING FOR THE MOMENT</i>

  WHEN MY WIFE MAKES FUN OF ME
           FOR BLANK
    ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.
           JERMAINE.
- SHE--SHE'S GONNA SAY SOMETHING
            ABOUT ME

    LEAVING CLOTHES ALL OVER
   THE FLOOR IN OUR BEDROOM.
    - SO WOULD THAT JUST BE
       JUST HORRIFYING...
       - WELL, I MEAN...
    - IF SHE WOULD SAY THAT?

     - I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
    TO KNOW HOW MESSY I AM.
  - OH, BOY, NOW WE ALL KNOW.
            - YEAH.
       - ALL RIGHT. MATT.
- I FORGET EVERYTHING WITH HER,

 AND SHE'D SAY THE FIRST THING
 THAT'S GONNA GO IS MY MEMORY,
        SO SHE WOULD SAY
   I WOULD FORGET EVERYTHING.
- OKAY. ANDREW, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - WEARING A JUMPSUIT.

      - OKAY. SO WHAT IS--
     WHAT IS THE JUMPSUIT?
   ARE YOU MAKING VIDEOS WITH
  THE JUMPSUIT? WHAT ARE YOU--
    - NO, IT'S JUST TO WEAR
       AROUND THE HOUSE.

 IT'S, UH, I-I DON'T KNOW WHY.
      I THINK IT WAS, UM,
      FROM WATCHING <i>LOST.</i>
 IN--IN SOME OF THE FLASHBACKS,
 THEY ALL HAD THESE JUMPSUITS.

     AND I SAID, "I'D LIKE
      TO HAVE A JUMPSUIT,"
      SO SHE BOUGHT ME ONE
FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT ONE TIME.
            - YEAH?

      - AND NOW I WEAR IT
    AROUND THE HOUSE, BUT...
- ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, THANK YOU.
           NICE JOB.
       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,

BECAUSE THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST
 POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME
  WILL WIN A FANTASTIC SECOND
   HONEYMOON TO THE BAHAMAS.
         CHECK IT OUT.

  BASK IN THE WARM HOSPITALITY
         OF THE BAHAMAS
      AT THE ALL-INCLUSIVE
PARADISE ISLAND HARBOUR RESORT.
      ENJOY CASUAL DINING,
          LIVELY BARS,

      AND DAILY ACTIVITIES
 WHILE RELAXING ON THE RESORT'S
      PRIVATE LAGOON BEACH
              FROM
PARADISE ISLAND HARBOUR RESORT.

OKAY, THE WIVES HAVE JOINED US.
        WELCOME, LADIES.
        WERE YOU FEELING
  A LITTLE BIT OF TREPIDATION

   KIND OF SITTING BACK THERE
          NOT KNOWING?
        - A LITTLE BIT.
   - A LITTLE BIT? ALL RIGHT,
   WELL, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
  EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS WORTH
    5 POINTS, SO HERE WE GO.

LADIES, IF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
 PLAYED SEVEN MINUTES IN HEAVEN
AT YOUR NORMAL LOVEMAKING PACE,
 BY THE TIME THE CLOCK RAN OUT,
    DID HE SAY YOU WOULD BE

    WARMING UP, IN THE ACT,
            OR DONE?
             HEIDI.
             - HMM.

   KNOWING MATT, I WOULD SAY
     WE WERE PROBABLY DONE.
    - YOU'RE PROBABLY DONE.
    SEVEN MINUTES IN HEAVEN
       AND YOU'D BE DONE.

    WHAT DID YOU SAY, MATT?
          WARMING UP.
            [laughs]
   WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, TARA?

   - I WOULD SAY IN THE ACT?
      - ALL RIGHT, ANDREW.
          WARMING UP.
           - [laughs]

  - THAT--THAT--YOU--THAT'S--
       IS THAT LAUGHABLE?
 - I DON'T LIKE THE WARMING UP
           THAT MUCH.
- YOU DON'T LIKE THE WARMING UP
           THAT MUCH?

- I LIKE TO GET INTO IT. I DON'T
   LIKE IT TO TAKE THAT LONG.
 - OKAY. ALL RIGHT, NO PRESSURE
      ON YOU, ANDREW, HUH?
   - YEAH, NOT TOO MUCH, NO.

  - JENNIFER, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
            - DONE.
            - DONE?
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  JERMAINE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

          IN THE ACT.
         - IN THECT.
         - IT'S AMAZING
 WHAT THE WIVES THINK AND WHAT
 THE HUSBANDS THINK ABOUT THIS.

         - I'D BE DONE.
          - I LOVE IT.
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION,
 SURE, YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL NOW,

 BUT WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
   IS THE ONE BAD-GIRL HABIT
 YOU KICKED BEFORE YOU MET HIM?
             TARA.

  - MAKING OUT WITH STRANGERS.
           [laughter]
- THAT WILL GET YOU EVERY TIME,
             GIRL.

            - YEAH.
  - WELL, ONCE I FOUND ONE GUY
       TO MAKE OUT WITH,
      I STOPPED MAKING OUT
       WITH OTHER PEOPLE.

           - [laughs]
  ANDREW, NO PRESSURE ON YOU.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        EATING BAD FOOD.

             - OH.
            - YEAH.
    - YEAH, HE LIKES TO BUY
    SORT OF ORGANIC-Y FOOD,
          FRESH FOOD.

      I'M FROM THE SOUTH.
     WE LIKE TO FRY IT UP.
            - YEAH.
           [cheering]

          - ALL RIGHT.
   JENNIFER, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- I GAVE UP RIDING MOTORCYCLES.

   JERMAINE DOESN'T LIKE IT.
 - DID YOU HAVE YOUR OWN BIKE?
            - I DID.
       - WHERE IS IT AT?
        - I CRASHED IT.

- OH! I WONDER WHY HE WANTED YOU
      TO GIVE THAT ONE UP.
             - YEP.
            - YEAH.
 - WHAT DID YOU SAY, JERMAINE?

 MAKE THE GUYS BUY YOU DRINKS.
          - OH, YEAH.
     HE STOPPED THAT, TOO.
      - ALL RIGHT, HEIDI.

   - MAYBE FLAUNTING MY STUFF
          AT THE GYM.
     - ALL RIGHT, FLAUNTING
     YOUR STUFF AT THE GYM.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
            SMOKING.

             - OH.
         - I WAS HOPING
SHE'D BE SMOKING SOMETHING ELSE,
        NOT CIGARETTES.
   - WHO ARE YOU MARRIED TO?

          - ALL RIGHT.
 SO THIS IS THE FINAL QUESTION,
            LADIES.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
       COMPLETE THIS POST

    TO HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT?
   I'M AT <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME </i>
  <i>JUST WAITING FOR THE MOMENT</i>
  WHEN MY WIFE MAKES FUN OF ME
           FOR BLANK

    ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.
           JENNIFER.
       - THE WAY I DANCE.
 - WHAT DID YOU SAY, JERMAINE?

      LEAVING THE CLOTHES
         ON THE FLOOR.
             - OH.
   - IT WAS MAKING FUN OF ME.

            - YEAH.
             I WAS.
 - HOW DO YOU DANCE, JERMAINE?
       - HE GOES ALL OUT.

         - I'M KIND OF
     AN OLD-SCHOOL DANCER.
   I HAVE, LIKE, A, YOU KNOW,
         A LITTLE, UH,
  KICK-STEP, RUNNING MAN-TYPE
       DANCING, YOU KNOW.

       SO I THINK THAT'S
    WHAT SHE'S REFERRING TO.
       - I AM A LITTLE--
            - OKAY.
       COULD YOU SHOW US
  YOUR KICK-STEP RUNNING MAN?

          - HE SHOULD.
           [cheering]
       - WELL, YOU KNOW,
     I COULD DO A LITTLE...
       - OH, KID 'N PLAY.
           ALL RIGHT.

         - SO I THINK--
         I THINK THAT'S
    WHAT SHE'S REFERRING TO.
            - IT IS.
       - OKAY. THANK YOU.

       ALL RIGHT, HEIDI,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - HE IS THE MOST FORGETFUL
          PERSON EVER,
      SO HIS FORGETFULNESS
      I WOULD MAKE FUN OF.

            - OKAY.
    MATT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     HE FORGETS EVERYTHING.
     TARA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - UM, I WOULD SAY
       BEING INDECISIVE.
          - ALL RIGHT,
     AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  - I SAID WEARING A JUMPSUIT.
   - HIM WEARING A JUMPSUIT.

    - HE HAS THIS JUMPSUIT.
 - TELL ME ABOUT THIS JUMPSUIT.
 - IT'S A POWDER BLUE JUMPSUIT,
            AND I...
      I BOUGHT IT FOR HIM.

'CAUSE HE SAID ONE DAY, "I WOULD
 REALLY LIKE TO HAVE A JUMPSUIT
JUST TO WEAR AROUND THE HOUSE,"
        AND SO HE DOES.
AND HE WEARS, LIKE, A WIFEBEATER
     TANK TOP UNDERNEATH IT

  AND LEAVES IT ALL UNBUTTONED
         DOWN TO HERE,
     AND HE, LIKE, GOES OUT
    AND GRILLS ON THE PATIO
       AND SPENDS THE DAY
        IN HIS JUMPSUIT.

   - CAN WE GET A HALF POINT
      FOR THAT? I MEAN...
   - LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND
        WITH OUR SCORES.
    MATT AND HEIDI, YOU GUYS
 ARE IN THE LEAD WITH 5 POINTS.

       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,
  AND THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED,
         SO STAY TUNED.

          THESE NEXT 3
   ARE WORTH 10 POINTS EACH.

         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.
            - OKAY.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
       SOMETIMES I THINK
       I MARRIED A MULE,

    BECAUSE MY HUSBAND IS SO
STUBBORN WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
             HEIDI.
- I CONSTANTLY HAVE TO TELL HIM
    TO TURN OFF THE LIGHTS,

    AND HE JUST WON'T DO IT.
     EVERY DAY I COME HOME,
EVERY LIGHT IN THE HOUSE IS ON.
- AND THEN YOU GO BACK THROUGH,
          CUT 'EM OFF,

  AND HE CUTS 'EM RIGHT BACK?
    - NO, I TAKE HIM TO THEM
    AND SAY, "TURN IT OFF."
  - WELL, IS THAT ONE WORKING,
             MOMMY?

             - NO.
       - NO, NOT WORKING.
- OH, BUT HE LIKES THE SPANKING.
  - OH, HE LIKES THE SPANKING.
  MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE DOES IT,
              HUH?

  ALL RIGHT, THAT'S A GOOD WAY
    TO GET A SPANKING. TARA.
   - HE'S NOT VERY STUBBORN,
  BUT I GUESS THAT ONE THING--
   HE ALWAYS--WHEN HE SLEEPS,
   HE ALWAYS WEARS EARPLUGS.

            - OKAY.
- AND IT MAKES ME KIND OF CRAZY,
   'CAUSE I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE,
      WHAT IF I NEED YOU?
   WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
        AND I NEED YOU,

     AND YOU CAN'T HEAR ME?
BUT HE ALWAYS PUTS IN EARPLUGS.
   - HE PUTS IN THE EARPLUGS.
            - YEAH.
     - OKAY. AND JENNIFER.

    - I WOULD SAY CLEANING.
          HE'S A SLOB.
         AND I TELL HIM
   WE'RE HAVING PEOPLE OVER,
     YOU HAVE TO CLEAN UP,
        AND HE DOESN'T,

     SO I END UP DOING IT,
     AND I THINK THAT'S WHY
       HE DOESN'T DO IT,
    'CAUSE HE KNOWS I WILL.
- BECAUSE HE KNOWS YOU'LL DO IT.
     - HE JUST WON'T DO IT.

           - LADIES,
   HERE'S OUR NEXT QUESTION.
  WHEN YOUR HUSBAND PERSPIRES
          DURING SEX,
        DO YOU FEEL LIKE
  YOU'RE CAUGHT IN A MONSOON,

    STUCK IN A MILD SHOWER,
      OR UNDER A SLOW LEAK
        IN THE CEILING?
             TARA.

      - UM, I'M GONNA SAY
   SLOW LEAK IN THE CEILING.
    HE DOESN'T SWEAT A LOT.
           YOU KNOW,
  HE DOESN'T PERSPIRE A LOT...

            - YEAH.
      - WHICH DOESN'T MEAN
    HE DOESN'T GET INTO IT.
          - JENNIFER.

     - I'D SAY A SLOW LEAK.
      HE DOESN'T PERSPIRE.
            - OKAY.
        - HE'S WORKING,
    BUT HE DOESN'T PERSPIRE.
   - BUT JUST NOT PERSPIRING.

             HEIDI.
     - MATT'S THE SAME WAY,
   SO I WOULD SAY SLOW LEAK.
      - A SLOW LEAK, OKAY.
   THIS IS OUR NEXT QUESTION.

 OF ALL THE THINGS YOUR HUSBAND
          HUNGERS FOR,
     HIS APPETITE FOR WHAT
    CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED.
           JENNIFER.

        UM, HIS APPETITE
     FOR ME GOING "SOUTH."
             - OH.

    CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED.
      - NO, NEVER ENOUGH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             HEIDI.

     - THE MAN IS A FOODIE,
SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO THAT WAY
 AND SAY KRYSTAL'S HAMBURGERS.
          KRYSTAL'S--
    OH, BUT THOSE ARE GOOD.

 - YEAH, AND I'M A VEGETARIAN,
        SO I DON'T CARE.
             - OH.
        - BUT, YOU KNOW,
       I MIGHT EAT MEAT.
    I JUST DON'T DIGEST IT.

          - OH, OKAY.
        I LOVE THAT ONE.
      WRITE THAT ONE DOWN.
            THAT'S--

     THAT'S ONE YOU PUT ON
        FOR A RINGTONE.
            LOVE IT.
             TARA.

 - UM, HE LOVES--HE LOVES, UM,
   LIKE, GAME, LIKE, A, LIKE,
    I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, LAMB
     AND THAT KIND OF FOOD,

      HE LOVES, LIKE, LAMB
   AND FANCY FOOD LIKE THAT,
     SO I'M GONNA SAY THAT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
        SO, LIKE, LAMB.
  - WE'RE NOT GONNA SAY THAT.

     THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
   HERE IS A BONUS QUESTION.
        IT HAS 2 PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.

          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
     BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,
     THE ONE WITH THE MOST

   LET'S CHECK ON THE SCORE.
    MATT AND HEIDI, YOU GUYS
 ARE IN THE LEAD WITH 5 POINTS.

    FELLAS, HERE'S THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       SOMETIMES I THINK
       I MARRIED A MULE,

       BECAUSE MY HUSBAND
         IS SO STUBBORN
    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
             MATT.
  - MM, HOW ABOUT I'M STUBBORN

  ABOUT LEAVING THE LIGHTS ON,
     BECAUSE I JUST DON'T--
   KEEP TURNING 'EM BACK ON.
 - ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK,
             MATT?

           - [sighs]
     I LIKE TO SEE THINGS.
           - [laughs]
         HEIDI, DOES HE
      LIKE TO SEE THINGS?

   - HE LIKES TO SEE THINGS.
          - 'CAUSE YOU
     TURN ON THOSE LIGHTS.
            - WHOO.

      - ALL RIGHT, ANDREW.
   - UM, I WOULD SAY TALKING.
           - TALKING?
     - UH, YEAH. SOMETIMES
   SHE'LL SAY, "TALK TO ME,"

AND THAT JUST MAKES ME FREEZE UP
     IF THERE'S THAT MUCH--
       IF IT'S A DEMAND.
- THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH PRESSURE.
            - YEAH.

            - OKAY.
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, TARA?
 - I SAID, UM, WEARING EARPLUGS
    AT NIGHT WHEN I'M LIKE,

   WHAT IS SOMETHING HAPPENS
             TO ME
  AND I NEED YOU IN MY SLEEP?
            all: AW.

- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, JERMAINE?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
          I'M STUBBORN
         WHEN IT COMES
      TO DOING YARD WORK.

           - REALLY?
       - CAN'T STAND IT.
 - JENNIFER, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - CLEANING.

     OH, WE CAN'T TAKE IT.
         I'M SO SORRY.
     - I END UP DOING BOTH.
     - JERMAINE, YOU GOTTA
   STOP DOING THE RUNNING MAN

 AND HELP OUT AROUND THE HOUSE.
  I MEAN, I KNOW YOU PUT A LOT
     OF ATTENTION AND TIME
    INTO THE DANCES, BUT YOU
   GOTTA HELP YOUR WIFE OUT.

     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
   THIS IS OUR NEXT QUESTION.
 WHEN YOU PERSPIRE DURING SEX,
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
         SHE FEELS LIKE

   SHE'S CAUGHT IN A MONSOON,
       STUCK IN A SHOWER,
      OR UNDER A SLOW LEAK
        IN THE CEILING?

            ANDREW.
    - I WOULD SAY SLOW LEAK
        IN THE CEILING.
     I'M NOT A BIG SWEATER.

       - ALL RIGHT, TARA,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I SAID SLOW LEAK
        IN THE CEILING.
       - SLOW LEAK, YEAH.
            - YEAH!

        - AND, JERMAINE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I WOULD SAY SLOW LEAK.
    - A SLOW LEAK. JENNIFER?
         - WE GOT ONE.
          - SLOW LEAK.

         AND YOU, MATT.
        - I'M GONNA HAVE
    TO KEEP THE TRAIN GOING.
   I THINK IT'S A SLOW LEAK.
         - A SLOW LEAK.

            - YEAH.
     - HEIDI. A SLOW LEAK.
          - SLOW LEAK.
     - ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,

       OF ALL THE THINGS
        YOU HUNGER FOR,
     YOUR APPETITE FOR WHAT
    CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED?

           JERMAINE.
        - I LIKE TO PLAY
     A LOT OF VIDEO GAMES.
             - MM.

  - SO I WOULD SAY MY APPETITE
FOR Xbox OR PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.
     - ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     SHE SAID YOUR APPETITE
     FOR HER GOING "SOUTH"

    CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED.
  - WELL, THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
          - I'M RIGHT.

   - YEAH, WE'LL HAVE TO SAY
  THAT SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
            - OKAY.
           ALL RIGHT.
     MATT, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - I GOT THIS LITTLE THING
    FOR KRYSTAL HAMBURGERS.
- THEY'RE THE SQUARE HAMBURGERS,
          REALLY GOOD.
  - YEAH, DOWN SOUTH, WE HAVE
KRYSTALS DOWN THERE, NOT WHITE--

  - YEAH, THEY DON'T HAVE 'EM
     OUT HERE IN NEW YORK.
       YOU'RE MISSING OUT
     ON SOME GOOD KRYSTALS.
    HEIDI, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - HE DIGESTS THAT MEAT.

    - KRYSTAL'S HAMBURGERS!
      - ALL RIGHT, ANDREW.
      - UH, WELL, MY MIND
       ALSO WENT TO FOOD,

    UH, SO I WOULD SAY LAMB,
      WHICH IS MY FAVORITE
         KIND OF FOOD.
       - LAMB. ALL RIGHT.
    TARA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     - I TOTALLY SAID LAMB.
            - LAMB.
      - YEAH, YOU DID IT.
            - YEAH.
        - HE LOVES LAMB.

  SO WE'LL GET RIGHT INTO IT.
GENTLEMEN, OUR FIRST QUESTION--

       YOUR WIFE MIGHT BE
      A TIGER IN THE SACK,
    BUT WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL
     DOES SHE SOUND LIKE--
     A QUIET, LITTLE MOUSE,

      A LOW-MOANING WOLF,
 OR A SCREECHING BELUGA WHALE?
            STEVEN?

      - SHE SOUNDS LIKE--
          LIKE A WOLF.
   SHE'S LOUD, BUT NOT THAT--
      NOT--NOT THAT LOUD.
       - CAN YOU SHOW ME
   WHAT IT MIGHT SOUND LIKE?

   DERRICKO, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I WILL HAVE TO SAY

        - SHE START OFF
      LIKE A WOUNDED WOLF,
  LIKE, WHIMPERIN', YOU KNOW,
       LIKE... [whimpers]

          - HOW DOES--

    THEN SHE GETS... [howls]
             - OH.
       - YOU KNOW, SO...
    SO YOU KNOW WHAT IT IS.

   YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.
  - SO SHE REALIZES, "I'M NOT
    WOUNDED AFTER ALL," HUH?
          - NORMALLY,
     I WOULD GO WITH MOUSE.

     - HOW DOES THAT SOUND?
            - UH...
 [whispering] SHE'S VERY QUIET.
        JUST VERY QUIET.
         - [whispering]
   SO EVERYTHING'S LIKE THIS?

  IT'S A--YOU KNOW... [growls]
           - [laughs]
    - IT'S A VERY LOUD MOUSE
           AT TIMES.

    - NOW OUR NEXT QUESTION,
           HUSBANDS--
   IF YOUR WIFE WERE THE STAR
   OF AN EPISODE OF <i>HOARDERS,</i>
    WHAT WOULD BE THE THING
  SHE WAS GUILTY OF HOARDING?

           DERRICKO?
            - MAIL.
    - WE HAVE A MAIL BASKET,

      BUT THE MAIL BASKET
  IS ACTUALLY THE WHOLE CRIB.
     IT'S JUST EVERYWHERE.
         - OKAY. DAVID?

       - THE CLOTHES ARE,
     YOU KNOW, OMNIPRESENT.
  THEY'RE EVERYWHERE. THERE'S
 DRAWERS OPEN AND CLOSETS OPEN
       AND THINGS HANGING
          ON THE DOORS

    AND HANGERS EVERYWHERE.
     I'LL GO WITH CLOTHES.

            - YEAH,

  - DOES THAT MAKE YOU HAPPY?

     - YEAH. YEAH, IT DOES.
           - OH, HO.
         OKAY. THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--

 THAT SHE'S THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO LIKES TO BE BLANKED IN BED,
    NEXT THANKSGIVING DINNER
  WOULD BE VERY, VERY AWKWARD.

             DAVID?
    - I DON'T KNOW. SPANKED.
           - SPANKED.

  WHO ARE YOU GONNA BE SITTING
    ACROSS FROM AT THE TABLE

        AT THANKSGIVING?

         I DON'T KNOW.
           - [laughs]
           DERRICKO?

      - A GARDENING TOOL.
  MY WIFE LIKES TO BE TREATED
     LIKE A GARDENING TOOL
        IN THE BEDROOM.
            - OKAY.

  LET'S SEE, YOU GOT A SHOVEL,

- SHE WOULD LIKE TO BE SPANKED.

      - WELL, UH, SHE LIKE
       TO BE BEAT, BUT...

     - ALL RIGHT. JENNIFER?

   - I-IT DEPENDS ON MY MOOD,
            I GUESS,
   BUT I THINK WHAT HE WOULD
          PROBABLY SAY
    IS THE MOUSE, BECAUSE...
    - HOW DOES THAT SOUND--

           THE MOUSE?
   - HMM, JUST PROBABLY LIKE

- A LITTLE MOUSE. THAT'S RIGHT.
             - HEY.

      IF YOU WERE THE STAR
   OF AN EPISODE OF <i>HOARDERS,</i>

   WHAT DID YOU HUSBANDS SAY
       WOULD BE THE THING
  YOU WERE GUILTY OF HOARDING?
           KHADIJAH?
      - PROBABLY CLOTHES.
  - YOU GOT A LOT OF CLOTHES?

            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.

         YOUR DRAWERS.
          - JENNIFER?
   - I DIDN'T HAVE AN ANSWER
    UNTIL I HEARD THE MAIL,

'CAUSE HE--THEN I THOUGHT MAYBE
  THAT WOULD BE A GOOD ANSWER,
      BECAUSE HE'S ALWAYS
         YELLING AT ME
     FOR NOT THROWING AWAY
          THE MAIL...

           - MM-HMM.
   - AND NOT KEEPING THE MAIL
   INTO THE--IT PILES UP....
             - YES.
  - AND I HAVE TO SPEND HOURS
       GOING THROUGH IT.

            - OKAY.
    DAVID, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I SAID CLOTHES.
       - HE SAID CLOTHES.
           - CLOTHES?
            - YEAH.

- I DON'T BUY A LOT OF CLOTHES.
  - NO, BUT THEY'RE ALL OVER.
    THEY GOT THE--THE--THE--
   - MY CLOTHES ARE ALL OVER?
    - YOUR CLOTHES ARE ALL--
   WELL, MINE ARE OVER, TOO,

   BUT I NEEDED AN ANSWER...
 - I THINK YOURS ARE MORE OVER.
- AND THEY'RE ALL OVER THE DOORS
       AND THE--YOU KNOW.
            - CASEY?

 - I'M GONNA GO WITH UNDERWEAR,
      BECAUSE I CAN'T BUY
       ENOUGH UNDERWEAR.
   I JUST--I NEED TO HAVE IT
        IN EVERY COLOR,

  EVERY--EVERY, UH, MATERIAL,
        EVERY--I JUST...
            - YEAH?

           - STEVEN?

           UNDERWEAR.
       - GOOD JOB, BABY.
  - HERE'S OUR FINAL QUESTION.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    IF MY WIFE'S FAMILY KNEW
 THAT SHE'S THE KIND OF PERSON
WHO LIKES TO BE BLANKED IN BED,

    NEXT THANKSGIVING DINNER
  WOULD BE VERY, VERY AWKWARD.
           JENNIFER?

     - MAYBE, UH, SPANKED?
        - THERE YOU GO.
    DAVID, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - I KNOW WHAT SHE LIKES.

           - SPANKED.
     - ALL RIGHT! GOOD JOB.
          - ALL RIGHT.

             CASEY?
     - I LIKE IT WHEN HE'S,
        LIKE, AGGRESSIVE
    AND, LIKE, PULLS MY HAIR
          OR SPANKS ME

    OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
    SO I DON'T KNOW THE WORD
   THAT I WOULD SAY FOR THAT.
             UM...
     - SO WHAT'S EVERYBODY

   GONNA SAY AT THANKSGIVING
   AFTER THEY SEE THIS SHOW?
          - OOH, GOD,
    I DIDN'T THINK OF THAT.
           [laughter]

       - KIND OF BLOCKED
      THAT PART OUT, HUH?
           ALL RIGHT.

  - I'M GONNA GO WITH SPANKED.
        MAYBE HE SAID...

            SPANKED.
    I HOPE HE SAID SPANKED.
           [laughter]

       - WHY DO YOU HOPE
        HE SAID SPANKED?
    - BECAUSE I DO NOT NEED
      MY 86-YEAR-OLD AUNT,
       LIKE, "WHAT IS HE
        TALKING ABOUT?"

           [laughter]
    - SHE WATCHES THE SHOW?
          - UM, YEAH,
          SHE WATCHES
 EVERYTHING GAME SHOW NETWORK.

        - OH, DERRICKO,
         WHAT DID YOU--
   - I HOPE YOU WAS THINKING
        ABOUT AUNT LEAH
   WHEN YOU WROTE THAT CARD.

 - I MEAN, I WAS, BUT AUNT LEAH
KNOW I'M A GROWN MAN, TOO, NOW.
  - OKAY, THEN. ALL RIGHT, D.
    - ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID--
  WHAT DID YOU SAY, DERRICKO?

      - I SAID SPANKED...
    [speaking indistinctly]
   - ALL RIGHT, SAID SPANKED.
- YOU KNOW YOU LIKE TO BE BEAT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
 - WE KNOW YOU LIKE TO BE BEAT.

 - YOU LIKE IT ROUGH, YOU KNOW.
           - REALLY?
   - YOU LIKE TO BE SMACKED.
           - YOU LIKE
     A LITTLE VERBAL ABUSE.

  - OKAY! SO WE'RE GONNA STOP
