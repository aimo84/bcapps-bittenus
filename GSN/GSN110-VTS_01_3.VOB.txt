 - YES, IT WAS A RANDOM SEARCH,

  AND THEY WENT IN THE CORRECT
     BAG, AND THERE IT WAS.

        BECAUSE WE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE

          SO WE COULD
    ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.
   GENTLEMEN, YOU SOUND LIKE
         YOU'RE READY,
       SO WE'RE GONNA GET
          RIGHT TO IT.

     IF YOUR WIFE'S BREASTS
      WERE EYES ON A FACE,
 WOULD THAT FACE BE SURPRISED,
         SLIGHTLY SAD,

          OR FOCUSED?
            - LEWIS.
   - NO, THEY'RE NOT FOCUSED.

        THAT SOUNDS LIKE
      THEY'RE, LIKE, MEAN.
       [audience laughs]
     NO, THEY'RE SURPRISED.
       THEY'RE SURPRISED.
 - THEY'RE SLIGHTLY SURPRISED.

        - YEAH, THEY'RE
 DEFINITELY SLIGHTLY SURPRISED.
    - OKAY, WHAT ABOUT YOU,
             HIRAK?
       - LUCKILY FOR ME,
        VERY SURPRISED.

       - VERY SURPRISED,
           ALL RIGHT.
        AND LOOK AT YOU,
         YOU ARE HAPPY.
             OKAY.

            ANDREW?
      - I'D SAY SURPRISED.
          - SURPRISED.
   - SAD WOULD GET ME KILLED.

           - UH-HUH.
   - AND FOCUSED SOUNDS LIKE
          LASER BEAMS
       SHOOT OUT OF THEM.
 SO WE'RE GOING WITH SURPRISED.
        - SO SURPRISED.

           ALL RIGHT,
   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
       - HEY, LUCKY YOU,
      IT'S YOUR BIRTHDAY.
    AND YOUR WIFE'S PRESENT
TO YOU IS A GETTIN' BUSY SESSION

   IN ANY POSITION YOU WANT.
     SO WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE?
             HIRAK?

      - WELL, MY NICKNAME
       FOR HER IS DOG...
          - ALL RIGHT.
    - FOR A REASON, I GUESS.
    - SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA

        HAVE TO GO WITH
         DOGGIE STYLE.
      - WITH DOGGIE STYLE.
            ANDREW?
       - IT WOULD BE HER
        ON TOP, I THINK.

      I DON'T HAVE A GOOD
    JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT.
     IT'S JUST WHAT I LIKE.
            - OKAY.

     WHAT ABOUT YOU, LEWIS?
    - WELL, MY NICKNAME FOR
        MY WIFE IS DUCK.
            - OKAY.
- BUT THERE ISN'T A DUCKY-STYLE.

           - NO--NO.
    - WHICH WOULD BE WEIRD.
 UM...I LIKE HER ON TOP 'CAUSE
   THE ACTION'S IN YOUR FACE.
    AND YOU'RE LAYING BACK,
            LIKE...

            - YEAH,
      SO YOU GET TO ENJOY.
    - IT'S LIKE WATCHING TV,
          BUT BETTER.
         - BUT BETTER.
        OKAY, THANK YOU.

          THIS IS OUR
   FINAL QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
          IF YOUR WIFE
   STARTED A MOTORCYCLE GANG
          IN THE STYLE
     OF THE HELL'S ANGELS,

  GIVEN WHERE SHE SPENDS MOST
       OF HER FREE TIME,
       IT WOULD BE CALLED
        BLANK'S ANGELS.
            ANDREW?

         - IT WOULD BE
     THE INTERNET'S ANGELS.
    - THE INTERNET'S ANGELS.
            - YEAH.
 SHE COMES HOME FROM WORK, AND
 PUTS HER NOSE IN THE COMPUTER,

       AND WE GO TO BED,
        AND REPEAT, SO.
            - LEWIS?
      - I MIGHT GET KILLED
           FOR THIS.

        UM, IT WOULD BE
       THE COUCH ANGELS.
      - THE COUCH ANGELS.
         - SHE REALLY--
       WE BOTH LIKE TO--
  I MEAN, I HAVE A TV TATTOO.

        WE BOTH LOVE TV.
            - YEAH.
          - BUT YEAH,
        SO COUCH ANGELS.
      - THE COUCH ANGELS.
          - VERY COOL.

          - ALL RIGHT.
             HIRAK?
     - WHENEVER I GET HOME,
      OR EVEN WHEN I GET--
   I THINK I GET HOME EARLY,

      SHE'S ALWAYS THERE.
       SO I'M JUST GONNA
      GO WITH BED ANGELS,
         'CAUSE THAT'S
     USUALLY THE POSITION.

      SHE'S ON HER LAPTOP
          IN THE BED.
         - BED ANGELS.
            - OKAY.
       [audience laughs]

    OKAY, FELLAS, NICE JOB.
       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,

         - HI, SHERRI.

   WELL, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

        THREE QUESTIONS.
  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWER.

      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
    LADIES, IF YOUR BREASTS
      WERE EYES ON A FACE,

        DID YOUR HUSBAND
     SAY THAT FACE WOULD BE
    SURPRISED, SLIGHTLY SAD,
          OR FOCUSED?
              KIM?

      - I'D SAY SURPRISED.
          - SURPRISED.
             - YES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       HE SAID SURPRISED.
     [cheers and applause]

      - I THOUGHT FOCUSED
         MIGHT BE MEAN.
            - OKAY.
            MILLIE?
  - I WOULD GO WITH SURPRISED.

          - SURPRISED.
     HIRAK, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            - SORRY.
         JUST KIDDING.
     [cheers and applause]

      - ALL RIGHT, JENELL,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
           - FOCUSED?
           - FOCUSED.
            ANDREW.

      - HE SAID SURPRISED.
            - SORRY.
       - LIKE, LIKE, AN--
           LIKE, GRR.
            - MAYBE!
         I DON'T KNOW.

      - HE SAID FOCUSED IS
 MORE LIKE LASER SHOTS FLYING.
        - YEAH, LIKE...
           [chuckles]
          - ALL RIGHT.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.

      HEY, LUCKY FOR HIM,
 IT'S YOUR HUSBAND'S BIRTHDAY.
    AND YOUR PRESENT TO HIM
   IS A GETTIN' BUSY SESSION
   IN ANY POSITION HE WANTS.

     SO...WHAT DO YOU THINK
           HE CHOSE?
            MILLIE?
    - WELL, HIS FAVORITE IS,
    LIKE, SPOONING POSITION,

     KIND OF HIM BEHIND ME.
            - OKAY.
      - IT'S VERY SENSUAL.
       - THAT'S ROMANTIC.
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, HIRAK?

     HE SAID DOGGIE STYLE.
            - SORRY.
            - WHAT?
           - JENELL.

     - UM, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
    IT HAS TO BE ME ON TOP.
         - YOU ON TOP--
          YES, IT IS!
         - YOU FLIPPED
    THAT UP SO FAST, ANDREW.

          YOU'RE LIKE,
       "DON'T CHANGE IT."
  - I'M ALL BUSINESS, SHERRI.
        I'M READY TO GO.
       - STAY THE COURSE.

              KIM?
  - IT'S DEFINITELY ME ON TOP.
         - YOU ON TOP?
           - MM-HMM.
    - ALL RIGHT, YOU ON TOP,
         THERE YOU GO.

             OKAY.
     GIVE HER A KISS, YEAH!
     [cheers and applause]
           ALL RIGHT.
         IF YOU STARTED
   A MOTORCYCLE GANG, LADIES,

          IN THE STYLE
     OF THE HELL'S ANGELS,
     GIVEN WHERE YOU SPEND
    MOST OF YOUR FREE TIME,
 YOUR HUSBAND SAID IT WOULD BE
     CALLED BLANK'S ANGELS.

            JENELL?
    - I LOVE TO TAKE BATHS--
         BUBBLE BATHS--
  SO MAYBE THE BATHROOM ANGEL?

       - BATHROOM ANGELS.
        MM, SOUNDS CUTE.
          ANDREW SAID
       INTERNET'S ANGELS.
             - AW!

     HOW DO I SPEND MY TIME
        IN THE INTERNET?
       [audience laughs]
       - I THOUGHT ABOUT
    BATHROOM'S ANGELS ALSO.

       BUT IT SOUNDED...
       - IT DOES SOUND--
  - WORSE THAN HELL'S ANGELS.
           [laughing]
          - OKAY, KIM?

     - I HAVE A GIRL GANG,
   BUT IT'S NOT RELATED TO--
 A JOKE GIRL GANG, BUT IT'S NOT
RELATED TO WHERE WE SPEND TIME.
           - UH-HUH.
    - BUT I THINK I'M GONNA

       GO WITH IT 'CAUSE
       IT'S MY INSTINCT.
         I'M GONNA SAY
       RUNAROUND ANGELS.
   - RUNAROUND ANGELS, OKAY.
            - YEAH.

    - LEWIS, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     HE SAID COUCH ANGELS.
             - OH.
        - OH, I'M SORRY.

      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY,
            MILLIE?
       - WE SPEND MOST OF
    OUR TIME IN THE BEDROOM.
     EVEN IF IT'S--NO, EVEN
   IF IT'S JUST WATCHING TV.

         - OR SPOONING.
         - OR SPOONING,
       OR FORKING, OR...
            - YEAH.
       - EVERYTHING ELSE.
     I WOULD SAY BEDROOM'S.

      - BEDROOM'S ANGELS.
           ALL RIGHT,
     HIRAK, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      BED'S ANGELS, YEAH.

     [cheers and applause]
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
    LEWIS AND KIM, YOU GUYS
    ARE TIED FOR FIRST PLACE

     WITH HIRAK AND MILLIE.
   YOU BOTH HAVE TEN POINTS.

 ALL RIGHT, LADIES, IT IS YOUR
TURN TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.
      THESE NEXT THREE ARE
     WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.

          - THINK SO.
            - OKAY.
  MILLIE, YOU'RE LIKE, "OKAY."
         - DEEP BREATH.
        - THAT'S RIGHT,
      TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

     IF A COACH POPPED INTO
          YOUR BEDROOM
      TO GIVE YOUR HUSBAND
          A PEP TALK,
         WOULD HE SAY,
   "PUT SOME HUSTLE INTO IT!"

  "GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME!"
    OR, "THE SHOW AIN'T OVER
   TILL THE OLD LADY SINGS"?
       [audience laughs]
              KIM.

  - GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.
            - YEAH.
     HE CAN BE PREOCCUPIED
 WITH HIS SCHOOL AND STUFF, SO.

       - TO STAY FOCUSED
      IN WHAT'S GOING ON.
            - OKAY.
            MILLIE?
   - PUT SOME HUSTLE INTO IT.

       - PUT SOME HUSTLE
         INTO IT, WHY?
        - YES, SOMETIMES
   IT CAN SLOW DOWN A LITTLE.
        YOU KNOW, YOU...
     WANT IT CERTAIN WAYS,

            YOU WANT
      THE TEMPO TO CHANGE.
            - YEAH.
   - SO, I THINK I WOULD SAY
    PUT SOME HUSTLE INTO IT.
            - OKAY.

            JENELL.
    - EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE,
HE WILL LOSE FOCUS, AND GO BACK
TO WORK AND THINKING ABOUT WORK.
      AND NO--NOT NECES--
 OH, MY GOSH, NOT ALL THE TIME.

 BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE I'LL
 NOTICE HIM KINDA DRIFTING OFF.
      SO I'D SAY PROBABLY
GET YOUR HEAD BACK IN THE GAME.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   HERE'S THE NEXT QUESTION.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
      I CAN WRITE A NOVEL
       ABOUT MY HUSBAND,
        BUT HIS PRIVATE
       RITUAL OF BLANKING

   IS STRANGER THAN FICTION.
            MILLIE?
     - HE SLEEPWALKS A LOT.
        - OKAY. DOES HE
  EVENTUALLY COME BACK TO BED?

       - YEAH, SOMETIMES
   I'LL HEAR SOMETHING FALL,
  SO I'LL GO SEE WHAT IT WAS,
       AND IT'S HIM JUST
     LOOKING FOR SOMETHING.

BUT I'LL BRING HIM BACK TO BED.
 - ALL RIGHT, SO SLEEPWALKING.
            JENELL?
          - HE'S GONNA
    KILL ME FOR SAYING THIS,

   BUT SOMETHING THAT HE DOES
  THAT MOST PEOPLE DON'T KNOW
          IS HE PLAYS
      THE MAGIC CARD GAME.
        SO HE'LL, UM...
           - HE DOES?

           - HE DOES.
 AND HE HAS A COUPLE OF FRIENDS
      THAT WILL COME OVER,
  AND HE VERY PRIVATELY PLAYS.
 IT'S KIND OF LIKE THE DUNGEONS
 AND DRAGONS, BUT IN CARD FORM.

   SO I'D SAY THAT'S PROBABLY
  ONE OF HIS PRIVATE RITUALS.
             - KIM.
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
        DOING HIS HAIR.
       - DOING HIS HAIR.

   - HAVE YOU SEEN HIS HAIR?
           - I HAVE.
 - IT'S A WHOLE ROUTINE, YEAH.
            - YEAH.
     - HANDS OF HAIRSPRAY,
           TOWELS...

         I STILL DON'T
      FULLY UNDERSTAND IT.
            - OKAY.
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.

         THE FIRST TIME
      HE MET YOUR FAMILY,
        WAS YOUR HUSBAND
          DRESSED FOR
     A NIGHT AT THE OPERA,

   A NIGHT OUT WITH THE BOS
         OR A NIGHT IN
       WITH CHINESE FOOD?
            JENELL?

  - I THINK IT WAS A NIGHT IN
       WITH CHINESE FOOD.
            - OKAY.
              KIM?
  - UM, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE
  TO BE A NIGHT WITH THE BOSS.

   I THINK HE TRIED TO DRESS
  A LITTLE BIT CONSERVATIVELY,
          BUT NOT LIKE
   HE WAS GOING TO THE OPERA.
            - OKAY.
            MILLIE?

     - HE WAS DRESSED LIKE
 HE WAS GOING TO SEE HIS BOSS,
          OR AT WORK.
          SO IT WAS--
     WE WENT OUT TO DINNER,
       SO HE DRESSED UP.

            - OKAY.
         WELL, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS,
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.

          HERE WE GO.
  WHEN MAKING A PROS AND CONS
    LIST ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND,
       AT THE TOP OF YOUR
    PRO LIST WOULD BE BLANK,

         AND THE NUMBER
    ONE CON WOULD BE BLANK?
              KIM?
  - AT THE TOP OF MY PRO LIST
        I THINK WOULD BE

         THAT HE'S FUN.
       HE'S A LOT OF FUN.
          WE DO A LOT
    OF FUN THINGS TOGETHER.
   AT THE TOP OF MY CON LIST
    WOULD BE HE'S FORGETFUL.

 HE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.
           - MILLIE?
          - DEFINITELY
    ON TOP OF THE PROS LIST,

          I WOULD SAY
      HIS SENSE OF HUMOR.
           - MM-HMM.
- THAT'S WHAT ATTRACTED TO ME--
       TO HIM INITIALLY.

       FOR HIS CONS LIST,
     HE GIVES ME NICKNAMES
       THAT I DON'T LIKE.
   - WHAT KIND OF NICKNAMES?

       - THIS IS SO BAD.
           LIKE, DOG.
       [audience laughs]
       - HE TOLD US ABOUT
    THE DOG NICKNAME, YEAH.

     - OF COURSE HE WOULD.
           - JENELL?
     - I WOULD SAY THE PRO,
    HE'S...HE'S MY STRENGTH.

       HE'S ALWAYS THERE,
      AND HE'S MY SUPPORT.
        AND--OH, GOSH--
           THE CONS.
       THE ONE THING THAT
 REALLY IRKS ME THAT HE DOES--

          AND I--YEAH.
   HE BITES HIS FINGERNAILS,
     AND IT DRIVES ME NUTS.
     SO THAT'S ONE OF THEM.
            - OKAY.
       LADIES, THANK YOU.

        WHEN WE RETURN,
    WE'LL SEE JUST HOW WELL
         THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

   - ALL RIGHT, THE GUYS ARE
 BACK TO SEE IF THEY CAN MATCH
          THE ANSWERS
       THEIR WIVES GAVE.
    FELLAS, HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.

  ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE, IF A
 COACH POPPED INTO YOUR BEDROOM
    TO GIVE YOU A PEP TALK,
         HE WOULD SAY,
   "PUT SOME HUSTLE INTO IT!"

  "GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME!"
    OR, "THE SHOW AIN'T OVER
   TILL YOUR OLD LADY SINGS"?
             LEWIS?

     - I DON'T HAVE MY HEAD
      IN THE GAME ENOUGH.
             - MM.
       - SO I'M GONNA GO
  KEEPING MY HEAD IN THE GAME.

- KEEPING YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.
            - YEAH.
     - AS YOUR ARMS CROSS.
   AS YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT.
    - I AM SURE ABOUT THIS.
            - OKAY.

     KIM, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   GET YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME!
         - YEAH! WHOO!
     [cheers and applause]

      - ALL RIGHT, HIRAK,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        - WELL, I THINK
   WE'VE GONE OVER THE WHOLE
        I'M TOO SENSUAL,
  OR SUPER SENSUAL PART OF IT.

     SO I THINK IF A COACH
   CAME IN, HE'D PROBABLY SAY
   "PUT SOME HUSTLE INTO IT."
   - MILLIE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
    PUT SOME HUSTLE INTO IT.
     [cheers and applause]

            ANDREW?
        - I'M GONNA SAY,
   PUT YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.
  - PUT YOUR HEAD IN THE GAME.

            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            JENELL?
          - THANK YOU.
   - PUT YOUR--GET YOUR HEAD
          IN THE GAME.

     [cheers and applause]
           ALL RIGHT.
         NEXT QUESTION.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

     I COULD WRITE A NOVEL
       ABOUT MY HUSBAND,
        BUT HIS PRIVATE
       RITUAL OF BLANKING
   IS STRANGER THAN FICTION.

             HIRAK?
        - GETTING WAXED?
        - GETTING WAXED.
         YOU GET WAXED?
             WHERE?

      - YOU SAID PRIVATE,
     NOW I FEEL LIKE, YEAH.
            - YEAH.
      - I CAME OUT TO YOU,
     AND NOW YOU'RE LIKE...
   - AND I'M SO APPRECIATIVE

          YOU SAID IT.
        THAT YOU SHARED.
    MILLIE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         - THIS SUCKS.

 - SHE SAID YOUR PRIVATE RITUAL
        OF SLEEPWALKING.
        - I'M GONNA NEED
      A DRINK AFTER THIS.
           [laughing]
          - ALL RIGHT.

            ANDREW?
      - GETTING READY FOR
          WORK, MAYBE?
           - JENELL,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

          PLAYING YOUR
       MAGIC CARD GAMES.
          - [laughing]
- YOU LEAVE THE DOOR OPEN FOR--
       THE CAT COMES IN.

  - WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE CAT?
    - SHE'S VERY SENSITIVE,
        JUST LIKE HIRAK,
           AND SHE...
       [audience laughs]

   SHE GETS, LIKE, VERY UPSET
      WHEN YOU SHUT DOORS.
       'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T
 SEE WHAT'S GOING ON IN THERE.
      SO I LEAVE THE DOOR
          OPEN A PEEK.

        AND IF SHE WANTS
   TO COME IN, SHE COMES IN,
  IF SHE DOESN'T, SHE DOESN'T.
      - ALL RIGHT, LEWIS?

    - WELL, I WEAR CONTACTS.
 AND WHEN I'M PUTTING THEM IN,
       I OPEN THE PACKET
    AND JUST DUMP THE SALINE
    SOLUTION ON THE GROUND.

            AND WHEN
     SALINE SOLUTION DRIES,
   IT LEAVES THIS WHITE STAIN
THAT LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING ELSE.
             - YES.
      IT'S YOUR CONTACTS.

  - MY CONTACT LENS SOLUTION,
        PUTTING THEM ON.
            - OKAY.
      KIM, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        DOING YOUR HAIR.
 - THAT'S NOT A PRIVATE RITUAL!

     THIS IS FOR EVERYONE.
       [audience laughs]
        - IT IS, IT IS.
 - THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S HAIRDO.
      - IT ABSOLUTELY IS.
   - YOU'RE NOT DONALD TRUMP.

          - [laughing]
          - ALL RIGHT.
    NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
         THE FIRST TIME
  YOU MET YOUR WIFE'S FAMILY,

       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
   THAT YOU WERE DRESSED FOR
     A NIGHT AT THE OPERA,
   A NIGHT OUT WITH THE BOSS,

         OR A NIGHT IN
       WITH CHINESE FOOD?
            ANDREW?
     - I'M GONNA SAY DINNER
         WITH THE BOSS.

    - DINNER WITH THE BOSS.
   - JENELL, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
             - NO!
      WE ALWAYS GO CASUAL.

- A NIGHT IN WITH CHINESE FOOD.
             - OH.
          - IT'S--UGH.
             - I--
       - I WORE MY OTHER
   COLLARED SHIRT, I WORE...

        - OH, I'M SORRY,
    THAT'S RIGHT, I FORGOT.
       THE COLLARED SHIRT
  DOES TAKE IT UP THAT NOTCH.
            - LEWIS?
        - I WORE, LIKE,

    THIS REALLY COOL SHIRT.
      IT WAS, LIKE, TIGHT,
    AND HAD "CHAOS" WRITTEN
      ON THE FRONT OF IT.
       - IT--YOU WENT TO
    MEET YOUR WIFE'S FAMILY

          WITH A SHIRT
       THAT SAID "CHAOS"?
     - YEAH, AND THEY SAID,
     "WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?"
       [audience laughs]

  - AND WHAT'D YOU TELL THEM?
 - I TOLD THEM I WAS SPONSORED
    BY THE T-SHIRT COMPANY.
            - OKAY.
      - WHICH ISN'T TRUE.
            - YEAH.

     BUT IT WAS A GOOD ONE.
       - YEAH, IT WORKED.
        THEY WERE LIKE,
    "WHOA, HE'S SPONSORED."
      - SO WHAT WOULD THAT
           HAVE BEEN?

     - IT WOULD BE--I WOULD
   WEAR THAT TO MEET MY BOSS.
   IN FACT, I HAVE WORN THAT
     MEETING WITH MY BOSS.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   AND KIM, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     WITH--FOR A NIGHT OUT
         WITH THE BOSS.
            - WHOO!
     [cheers and applause]

           ALL RIGHT.
     HIRAK, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I MET MILLIE, AND
  I KNEW THAT SHE WAS THE ONE,

            SO I HAD
     TO PLAY IT JUST RIGHT.
  SO IF I HAD TO PLAY IT JUST
RIGHT, I COULDN'T TRY TOO HARD,
 BUT I COULDN'T NOT TRY AT ALL.
           - MM-HMM.

 - I'M GONNA GO WITH THE BOSS.
           - MILLIE?
    NIGHT OUT WITH THE BOSS.
     [cheers and applause]

             YEAH.
         OKAY, SO LET'S

     GENTLEMEN, WHEN MAKING

     - YOU DRINK TOO MUCH.
        - AND MY PRO...
         SHE WOULD SAY
       MY SENSE OF HUMOR,
