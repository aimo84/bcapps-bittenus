THEY GOT A BRAND-NEW CAR.
      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT

   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,
  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.

      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD

TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.

      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,
      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.
   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE

FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,

   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,
    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,

     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.
    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,

AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,
    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE

   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.
  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM

 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.
 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.

      WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
    WE HAVE SENT YOUR WIVES
  BACKSTAGE SO WE CAN ASK YOU

    SOME QUESTIONS, SO WE'RE
    GONNA GET RIGHT INTO IT.
      ARE YOU READY, GUYS?
         - ABSOLUTELY.
      - YEP, LET'S DO IT.
    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

        FIRST QUESTION--
     WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
       YOU AND YOUR WIFE
   HAD AN AFTERNOON DELIGHT--
     WITHIN THE LAST WEEK,

     WITHIN THE LAST MONTH,
OR YOU'RE KIND OF NIGHT PEOPLE?
             JOHN.

      - DEFINITELY WITHIN
        THE LAST MONTH,
  NOT WITHIN THE WEEK, 'CAUSE
THE--YEAH, NOT WITHIN THE WEEK,
    NOT IN MY RECOLLECTION.
            - STEVE.

 - THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
  WOULD ACTUALLY BE YESTERDAY,
SO I'M GONNA SAY WITHIN A WEEK.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             CHRIS.

        - UH, I AM MORE
     OF AN EVENING PERSON,
    WHEREAS MY WIFE IS MORE
      OF A MORNING PERSON,
      BUT, UH, THANKFULLY,
       THIS PAST SUNDAY,

        WE HAD A LITTLE
       AFTERNOON DELIGHT.
      COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.
            - OKAY.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
         NEXT QUESTION.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
            MY WIFE
   FINDS MY BLANK HILARIOUS,
         BUT I FIND IT
   TO BE NO LAUGHING MATTER.

             STEVE.
       - UH, I HAVE A LOT
  OF CRAZY ORGANIZED HABITS...
           - MM-HMM.
         - AND I THINK

   THAT, SECRETLY, SHE THINKS
       IT'S REALLY FUNNY.
      - ALL RIGHT. CHRIS.
        - I'M REALLY BAD
   ABOUT MATCHING MY CLOTHES.

            - YEAH?
  - SO SHE ALWAYS LAUGHS AT ME
   WHEN I COME IN, I'M LIKE,
        "SO THIS IS GOOD
      FOR TONIGHT, RIGHT?"
        AND SHE'S LIKE,

       "NO. NO, THAT'S--
 THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK AT ALL."
SO I'M GONNA GO WITH MY--I GUESS
   MY SENSE OF FASHION, YEAH.
       - ALL RIGHT. JOHN.

   - UH, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
            MY FEET.
            - FEET?
            - YEAH.
      THEY ARE PRETTY FLAT
         AND VERY WIDE.

            - YEAH?
      - SO SHE CALLS THEM
        SAIL--SAILBOATS.
   - OKAY. I LIKE THAT NAME.

     ALL RIGHT, THIS IS OUR
   FINAL QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
  THINKING BACK TO EVERY WOMAN
  YOU'VE EVER HAD A CRUSH ON,
 WHAT SINGLE WORD BEST SUMS UP
           YOUR TYPE?

             CHRIS.
     - I-I LIKE WOMEN WHERE
     THAT THEY HAVE A SENSE
  OF PASSION ABOUT SOMETHING.

           - MM-HMM.
      - AND THEY WANT TO--
   THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING,
   YOU KNOW? SO A GO-GETTER.
             YEAH.
       - GO-GETTER. JOHN.

 SOMEONE WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR.
          - SO HUMOR?
 - YEAH, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT.
            - OKAY.
             STEVE.

- I-I WOULD SAY THAT MY--MY WIFE
     IS DEFINITELY MY TYPE,
      SO I WILL SAY, UM...
     BRUNETTE--LIKE, REALLY
DARK-HAIRED AND, UH, HER SKIN--

    THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT
  REALLY ATTRACTED ME TO HER.
- SO WOULD WE GO WITH BRUNETTE?
- YEAH, WE'LL GO WITH BRUNETTE.
     - BRUNETTE. ALL RIGHT.

         OF EACH OTHER

     AND HAVE A GREAT TIME,

 THING THAT WE HAVE ON OUR WALL

      AT THIS POINT. YEAH.
       - ALL RIGHT. JEN.
        - UH, I'M GONNA
     HAVE TO MAKE IT THREE.
 WE HAVE A REALLY HUGE MIRROR.

    WE HAVE THE SAME MIRROR
         IN THE HALLWAY
   THAT'S HANGING VERTICALLY.
THIS ONE'S HANGING HORIZONTALLY
         ABOVE THE BED.

     - ABOVE THE BED, TOO?
       - [laughing] YEAH.
           - REALLY?
             - YES.
        - OKAY, LADIES.

   HERE IS A BONUS QUESTION.

            LADIES--

    MY HUSBAND WAS BORN WITH
  A NATURAL ABILITY TO BLANK,
   WHILE I WAS BORN TO BLANK.
           VERONICA.

     - A NATURAL ABILITY...
        TO WATCH ESPN...
           - [laughs]

         - WHILE I HAVE
      THE NATURAL ABILITY
 TO DICTATE OR--OR RUN THINGS,
            I GUESS.
            - OKAY.
 - I'M KIND OF A CONTROL FREAK.

          - I GOT YOU.
             - YES.
             - JEN.
       - UM, HE WAS BORN
     WITH A NATURAL ABILITY

       TO... GET HIS WAY.
        - AND WHAT ABOUT
     YOUR NATURAL ABILITY?
      - UM, AND I WAS BORN
          TO BE HAPPY.

 I'M REALLY HAPPY ALL THE TIME,
   ESPECIALLY WITH THIS ONE,
   SO YEAH. [chuckles] YEAH.
        - OKAY. MARTHA.
 - I'M GONNA SAY HE'S BORN WITH
 A NATURAL ABILITY TO BE FUNNY.

             - YES.
          - I AM BORN
     WITH A NATURAL ABILITY
       TO TALK TO A WALL.

        I CAN SOCIALIZE
    WITH ANYONE AND ANYTHING
     FOR HOURS AT ANY TIME.
       - WITH THE MIRROR
        ABOVE YOUR BED.

         - YEP, MM-HMM.

        HERE'S THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.

   GENTLEMEN, LET'S FACE IT--
        NOT ALL ORGASMS
       ARE CREATED EQUAL,
       SO WHICH OF THESE
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY

HAS GIVEN HER THE MOST POWERFUL
       PEAK OF PLEASURE--
         YOU, HERSELF,
      OR HER FAVORITE TOY?
             JOHN.

     - I WOULD CONFIDENTLY
        HAVE TO SAY ME.
             - YOU?
             - YES.
 - VERONICA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        SHE SAID MY MAN!
          - ALL RIGHT!
          - OW! MWAH!
            - YEAH.
            [laughs]

   SHE SAID SHE DOESN'T NEED
         ANYTHING ELSE.
           ALL RIGHT.
             STEVE.
- YOU KNOW, WHEN JEN AND I MET,

         IT WAS--IT WAS
   REALLY INTENSE FIREWORKS.
            - OKAY.
- IT WAS VERY, VERY PASSIONATE,
  UH, WHICH IS DEFINITELY PART
     OF HOW WE GOT MARRIED

     AFTER, UH, THREE WEEKS
    AFTER WE STARTED DATING.
             - OH.
THAT WAS A LOT OF PASSION, HUH?
   - SO, UM, I'M GONNA SAY--
    THAT'S A LOT OF PASSION.

      SO I'M GONNA SAY ME.
       - YOU. ALL RIGHT.
      - I'M GONNA SAY ME.
    - JEN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        SHE SAID MY MAN.
            - YEAH!
             MWAH!
    - WHAT ABOUT YOU, CHRIS?
        - DEFINITELY ME.

        - NOTHING ELSE?
           - HERSELF?
 I MEAN, ALL SHE HAS TO DO IS,
  LIKE, YELL DOWN THE HALLWAY
 AND SAY, "CAN YOU COME IN HERE
    FOR A SECOND," YOU KNOW?

          IT'S LIKE--
   IT'S DEFINITELY ME, YEAH.
   - DEFINITELY YOU. MARTHA.
            MY MAN!
           - MY MAN.

       - COME HERE, BABY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
        LOVELY COUPLES.
      GENTLEMEN, OF COURSE
YOU'RE HAPPY TO BE HER HUSBAND,

      BUT WHAT LAST SHRED
     OF YOUR BACHELOR DAYS
 DID YOUR WIFE SAY YOU'RE STILL
   CLINGING TO FOR DEAR LIFE?
             STEVE.

       IS IT A LONG LIST?
     - YEAH. I-I'M SORTING
    AND COLLATING RIGHT NOW.
          - [laughing]

 WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED, STEVE?
   - I WAS LETTING YOU KNOW.
    OKAY, I WILL SAY, UH...
           TRAVELING.
   - OH, SO THAT'S SO CRAZY!

      - YEAH, THAT'S NOT--
    THAT'S NOT REALLY CRAZY.
   - JEN. I LOVE YOU, STEVE.
     JEN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- IT'S NOT MUCH CRAZIER, BUT...
 - YOUR ORGANIZATIONAL HABITS.

             - OH!
    - [stomps foot] STEVEN!
        YOU EVEN SAID IT
  WITH THE COLLATING AND UHH!
          - [cheering]
          - [laughing]

          OKAY, CHRIS.
 - UH, I STILL LIKE TO HANG OUT
     WITH MY BUDDIES A LOT
        ON THE WEEKEND.

 WE GO--WE GO TO A SOCCER GAME
 OR SOMETHING, CHECK THAT OUT,
      AND GO--GO DRINKING.
   - WHAT'D YOU SAY, MARTHA?
           - SOCCER.

          - ALL RIGHT,
      WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT.
         - YEAH! YEAH!
        YOU SAID SOCCER.
          - MM. YEAH!

        - THAT WAS GOOD.
            - JOHN.
- SOMETIMES, NOT ALL THE TIMES,
   WOULD BE THAT ALONE TIME.

- VERONICA, IS THIS A SURPRISE?
   - YEAH, I THOUGHT HE LOVED
 SPENDING EVERY MOMENT WITH ME.
             - OH!
       - OH, MY GOODNESS.

       - I THOUGHT I WAS
     HIS BREAD AND BUTTER.
   - I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.
    I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.
   - JOHN, I FEEL ALONE TIME
        COMING FOR YOU.

         I CAN FEEL IT.
     [cheers and applause]
 - VERONICA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        YOUR MESSINESS.

      - THE COMPUTER ROOM.
   - YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, I--
       - YOU GO AND ENJOY
     YOUR ALONE TIME, JOHN.

  LET'S SEE. WE'RE GONNA GO ON
     TO THE NEXT QUESTION.
   - AND I'M COMING IN, BABY.
  - HERE'S OUR NEXT QUESTION,

    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,
   WHAT IS THE LARGEST THING
        IN YOUR BEDROOM
THAT IS THE HANGING ON THE WALL

   - WE--WE HAVE A-A BIG, UH,
   SORT OF MIRROR FRAMED ART
         KIND OF THING
     HANGING ABOVE OUR BED.

    I'M GONNA GO WITH THAT.
    - SO HOW DOES THE MIRROR
        COME INTO PLAY?
        - IT'S A MIRROR
  SO YOU CAN LOOK AT YOURSELF

    SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE--
    WHEN YOU'RE IN THE BED--
      OR NOT IN THE BED--
  IT'S A BIG MIRROR, YOU KNOW?
      - ALL RIGHT, MARTHA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

        - I SAID MIRROR.

   - YOU KNEW I WOULD SAY IT!
            - OKAY.
     STEVE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - UH, YOU KNOW,

   THAT I'VE GOT ON THE WALL,
 AND THEN I REMEMBERED WE HAVE
    THIS REALLY HUGE MIRROR

     HANGING ABOVE OUR BED,
            AS WELL.
