        I've worked hard
       to build my family.
  And also to build my career.

 So I'm not about to always let
   my frequent bladder urges,
      or the worry my pipes
    might leak get in the way
     of my busy lifestyle.

     That's why I take care,
         with VESIcare.
  Once-daily VESIcare can help
   control your bladder muscle
     and is proven to treat
       overactive bladder

        with symptoms of
    frequent urges and leaks
         day and night.
 If you have certain stomach or
       glaucoma problems,

      or trouble emptying
         your bladder,
     do not take VESIcare.
   VESIcare may cause allergic
 reactions that may be serious.

  If you experience swelling of
         the face, lips,
        throat or tongue,
      stop taking VESIcare
     and get emergency help.

 Tell your doctor right away if
 you have severe abdominal pain,
 or become constipated for three
          or more days.
          VESIcare may
      cause blurred vision,

  so use caution while driving
     or doing unsafe tasks.
       Common side effects
  are dry mouth, constipation,
        and indigestion.

        I've worked hard
     to get to where I am...
       and I've got better
          places to go
           than always
     going to the bathroom.

 So take charge of your symptoms
    by talking to your doctor
     and go to vesicare.com

      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES<i>E AND CARE</i>
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,<i>E.</i>

  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.

     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.

IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,

      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.

   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.

      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,

    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.

    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,

    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.

  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.

 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.
