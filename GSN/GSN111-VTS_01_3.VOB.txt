      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME A AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,

  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.

     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.

IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,

      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.

   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.

      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,

    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.

    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,

    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.

  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.

 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.

        SHERRI SHEPHERD!

           HI, GUYS.
    THIS IS IT. THIS IS IT.
       NEWLYWEDS, HELLO!
             HELLO!
  Captioning provided by GSN.

        THANK YOU, GARY.
  WELCOME TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>
          WHERE WE ASK
    YOUNG COUPLES EVERYTHING

           FROM WHO,
   WHEN, WHY, AND HOW LONG...
      JUST BECAUSE WE CAN.
   GARY, LET'S MEET TONIGHT'S
      THREE BRAVE COUPLES.

     - SHERRI, MEET COUPLE
 NUMBER ONE, DAN AND ADRIENNE.
       SHE LIKES A LITTLE
   MORNING NOOKY TO FUNCTION,
    OR SHE'S JUST NOT HAPPY.

LET'S HOPE HE'S AN EARLY RISER,

        TOM AND DEBORAH

    HAD THEIR WEDDING RUINED
         BY A TORNADO.
  IT WAS A GIANT TWISTER THAT
 TURNED HER WORLD UPSIDE DOWN.
         EH, BUT ENOUGH
   ABOUT THEIR WEDDING NIGHT.

      BACK TO YOU, SHERRI.
     [cheers and applause]
      - WELCOME, COUPLES.

       GOOD LUCK TO EACH
     AND EVERY ONE OF YOU.
   AND YOU BEAUTIFUL LADIES--
     I NEED YOU TO STAND UP
       AND GO BACKSTAGE,

     BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ASK
 YOUR HUSBANDS A FEW QUESTIONS.
     [cheers and applause]
   ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I'M GONNA
    ASK YOU THREE QUESTIONS,

  AND IT'S GONNA BE UP TO YOUR
  WIVES TO MATCH YOUR ANSWERS.
THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST POINTS
     AT THE END OF THE GAME
      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
       SECOND HONEYMOON.

        YOU READY TO GO,
           GENTLEMEN?
             - YES.
         - HERE WE ARE.
    ALL RIGHT, IN MARRIAGE,

    ACTIVITIES YOU ONCE DID
          BY YOURSELF
    BECAME ACTIVITIES YOU DO
       WITH YOUR SPOUSE.
   WHICH OF THESE ACTIVITIES
       HAVE YOU GUYS DONE

    AS A DUO MOST RECENTLY--
        GONE TO THE GYM,
        TAKEN A SHOWER,
   OR ENJOYED AN ADULT MOVIE?

    WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, DAN?
     - WELL, TO BE HONEST,
        IT WAS A SHOWER.
             - YES?
            - YEAH.

     THOUGH, I DON'T KNOW,
   I KIND OF LIKE TO GETTING
   THE SHOWER ALL TO MYSELF,
       BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
          YOU GET COLD

          IF THE WATER
      DOESN'T GET ON YOU.
           [chuckles]
  - BUT I THINK, WHEN YOU TAKE
       A SHOWER TOGETHER,

            IT'S NOT
    ABOUT SCRUBBING BUBBLES.
           IT'S ABOUT
    <i>SCRUBBING BUBBLES</i> TOGETHER.
  SO YOU SAY WHEN YOU ENJOYED
       A SHOWER TOGETHER.

           ALL RIGHT,
   WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, STEVE?
       - I'D HAVE TO SAY
 THE SHOWER AS WELL--SHOWERING.
            - YEAH?
             - YES.

    WE ONLY HAVE ONE SHOWER,
    AND TIME IS TIGHT OFTEN,
   SO WE HAD TO GO TOGETHER.
         - WAS IT GOOD?
        - IT WAS GREAT.

   SCRUBBED LOTS OF BUBBLES.
             - MM.
           [laughter]
    AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, TOM?

       - IT WOULD ALSO BE
          THE SHOWER.
          BUT THEN...
     THE LONGER WE SHOWER,
   THE MORE IT KIND OF TENDS
  TOWARDS THE GROWN-UP MOVIE--

    ADULT MOVIE ALSO, SO...
  - THAT'S WHAT I ALWAYS SAY--
     "AFTER A GOOD SHOWER,
      GO WATCH SOME PORN."

           [laughter]
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
        WHAT'S ONE ITEM
  YOUR WIFE USES THAT YOU HAD
      NEVER EVEN HEARD OF

     UNTIL YOU MARRIED HER?
             STEVE.
   - UH, PERHAPS THE LOOFAH.

           [laughter]
        I THOUGHT IT WAS
          AN AIRLINE.
    - YOU THOUGHT LUFTHANSA?

          IS THAT WHAT
     YOU WERE THINKING OF?
             - YES.
    - SO IT WAS THE LOOFAH.

           - CORRECT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT DO YOU SAY, TOM?
         - I THINK IT'S
      THE EYELASH CURLER.

      IT LOOKS LIKE A PAIR
   OF KIND OF TWEEZER/PLIERS,
       BUT I HAD NO IDEA
           WHAT FOR.
           - GOT YOU.
      WHAT ABOUT YOU, DAN?

          - THE DUVET.
          - THE DUVET?
     - YEAH, I'D NEVER USED
         A DUVET COVER.
     I DIDN'T KNOW YOU HAD
       TO COVER A COVER.

           [laughter]
           - I KNOW.
     IT SEEMS KIND OF DUMB.
         - IT'S WEIRD.

    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
     EVEN THOUGH YOUR WIFE
     IS JUST ABOUT PERFECT,
      WHICH OF HER FRIENDS
          DO YOU THINK

  COULD GIVE HER A COUPLE TIPS
   ON BEING A BIT MORE SEXY?
          AND YOU HAVE
      TO CHOOSE SOMEBODY.
              TOM.

    - I'D HAVE TO SAY LILY,
BECAUSE THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
     THE LONGEST AS ADULTS.
            - OKAY.
  - THEY WERE COLLEGE BUDDIES.

  - WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LILY?
            - UH...
             UHH...

   I THINK LILY--I THINK LILY
       IS A GREAT WOMAN,
  AND SHE AND DEB SHARE A LOT.
        SO I THINK THAT,
         UH, YOU KNOW,

          IF ANYTHING
  HAS TO BE EVER SAID TO DEB,
     LILY WILL BE THE ONE.
   - AND I WILL VOTE FOR YOU
            IN 2016.

        - OH, THANK YOU.
           THANK YOU.
  - THAT WAS THE BEST ANSWER.
        ALL RIGHT, DAN.

  - ADRIENNE'S FRIEND GITTEL.
           - GITTEL?
            - YEAH.
    - TELL US ABOUT GITTEL.

          - THEY SHARE
      AN OFFICE TOGETHER.
           THEY, UH--
      YOU KNOW, I THINK--
    - YOUR VOICE IS SHAKING.
         YOU ALL RIGHT?

            - YEAH.
   I'M JUST A LITTLE NERVOUS
 WHEN SHE HEARS THIS, YOU KNOW.
          - OH, OKAY.
        - IS GITTEL HOT?

   - YEAH, SHE'S KIND OF HOT.
      - SHE'S KIND OF HOT?
        - MM-HMM. YEAH.
   - STEVE, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

   - I'D HAVE TO SAY KRISTYN.
 - KRISTYN. WHAT ABOUT KRISTYN?
       TELL US ABOUT HER.
        - SHE'S PERFECT,
         LIKE MY WIFE,

    BUT A LITTLE WEALTHIER.
  - SHE'S A LITTLE WEALTHIER.
            - YEAH.
           [laughter]

   - ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT HER
     IN THE HOTNESS FACTOR?
         - ALWAYS TAN.
      - SHE'S ALWAYS TAN?
            - YEAH.

        - ANYTHING ELSE?
   - YOU'RE KILLING ME HERE.
           [laughter]
            - I AM--

      - I HAVEN'T MADE IT
 TO OUR FIRST ANNIVERSARY YET.
           [laughter]
          - I LOVE IT.
       FELLAS, THANK YOU.
           NICE JOB.

      WHILE WE'RE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,
         GARY, TELL US
ALL ABOUT THAT SECOND HONEYMOON
      THEY'RE PLAYING FOR.

   - TONIGHT'S <i>NEWLYWED</i> WINNERS

    - HOW'S THAT BEEN GOING?
    - YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD
        MORNING ACTIVITY
     FOR US TO DO TOGETHER.

            - YEAH?

   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
   THESE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
          HERE WE GO.

    IF YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER
       WITH YOUR HUSBAND
   WAS A HUNTING EXPEDITION,
WERE YOU THE UNSUSPECTING PREY,
   THE PREDATOR ON THE PROWL,

      OR DID YOU BOTH HAVE
   INSTANT ANIMAL ATTRACTION?
           ADRIENNE.
      - UNSUSPECTING PREY.
             - WHY?

          - ACTUALLY,
       WHEN WE FIRST MET,
        HE THOUGHT THAT
     WE WERE BEING SET UP,
  AND WE WERE JUST HANGING OUT
          AS FRIENDS.

AND I THOUGHT THAT HE WAS BEING,
      LIKE, VERY FORWARD,
 AND HE WAS TRYING TO SIT NEXT
    TO ME AND GET ME DRINKS.
           AND I WAS
     A LITTLE WEIRDED OUT,

      BUT HE WAS SO CUTE,
          SO I WANTED
   TO GO OUT WITH HIM AGAIN.
            - OKAY.
     DANA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - I WOULD SAY THAT I WAS
     PROBABLY THE PREDATOR.
    - YOU WERE THE PREDATOR?
            - YEAH.
HE WAS THE FIRST GUY THAT I EVER
  ACTUALLY, LIKE, WENT AFTER.

      I KNEW I WANTED HIM,
         AND I GOT HIM.
            - OKAY.
    DEBORAH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - INSTANT ANIMAL ATTRACTION.

           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.
     WE KNEW IT RIGHT AWAY.
          - ALL RIGHT.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       EVERY WOMAN LOVES
         A STRONG MAN.
 SO WHAT IS THE BIGGEST MUSCLE
    ON YOUR HUSBAND'S BODY?

      [laughter, murmurs]
             DANA.
      - WHAT IS IT CALLED?
        HIS ARM MUSCLES.

        - IS IT BICEPS?
   - YEAH, HE HAS BIG BICEPS.
   - HE HAS BIG BICEPS? YEAH?
           - UH-HUH.
           - DEBORAH.

          - HIS LEGS.
          - HIS LEGS?
     - YEAH. HE'S A DANCER.
             - AH.
     - ALL RIGHT, ADRIENNE.

 - I'M ALSO GONNA GO WITH ARMS.
        - WITH THE ARMS?
        - MM-HMM. YEAH.
       HE KNOWS IT'S ONE
     OF MY FAVORITE PARTS,

       AND SO, YOU KNOW,
        HE KEEPS THEM...
           IN SHAPE.
            - YEAH.
        [both laughing]

           ALL RIGHT,
       AND NOW A QUESTION
   FROM AIRWICK SCENTED OILS
    WINTER LUXURY EDITION--
   A COLLECTION OF INDULGENT
      SEASONAL FRAGRANCES.

           AS A GIFT,
 YOUR IN-LAWS ARE PROVIDING YOU
    WITH THE USE OF A MAID,
        A PERSONAL CHEF,
         OR A CHAUFFER
         FOR ONE YEAR.

      WHICH LUXURY SERVICE
    DOES YOUR HUSBAND THINK
       YOU NEED THE MOST?
            DEBORAH.

           - A MAID.
         - A MAID--WHY?
       - YEAH, WE'RE BOTH
          REALLY BUSY,
   AND WE TRY TO KEEP THINGS,
    YOU KNOW, LOOKING OKAY.

    BUT WE COULD REALLY USE
      A LITTLE EXTRA HELP.
        - A LITTLE MAID.
           ALL RIGHT.
           ADRIENNE.
           - A MAID.

      - ALL RIGHT, A MAID.
             DANA.
- I'M GONNA GO WITH A MAID TOO.
         - A MAID TOO.
            - YEAH.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
   HERE'S OUR BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

            LADIES,
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
       WHEN WE FIRST MET,
  I WONDERED IF MY HUSBAND WAS
   THE TYPE OF GUY WHO WOULD
      NEVER STOP BLANKING,

       AND HE WAS WORRIED
  THAT I WAS THE TYPE OF GIRL
        WHO WOULD NEVER
        START BLANKING.
           ADRIENNE.

      - WHEN WE FIRST MET,
   I WAS WORRIED THAT HE WAS
       THE TYPE OF GUY...
  WHO WOULD NEVER STOP TALKING
ABOUT VIDEO GAMES ALL THE TIME.

   AND I THINK HE WAS WORRIED
      THAT I WOULD NOT GET
     INTO HIS VIDEO GAMES.
     - DID YOU FINALLY GET
     INTO THE VIDEO GAMES?

 - SOMETIMES HE CAN CONVINCE ME
   TO PLAY SOME VIDEO GAMES.
       - ALL RIGHT, DANA.
     - HE WOULD NEVER STOP
       TAKING CARE OF ME.

   AND I WOULD NEVER START...
          EXERCISING.
     - THAT YOU WOULD NEVER
          START EXER--

         - YEAH, 'CAUSE
      HE'S REALLY HEALTHY,
 AND I DON'T LIKE TO EXERCISE.
            - OKAY.
            DEBORAH.

     - I THOUGHT AT FIRST,
  HE WOULD NEVER STOP TOURING,
     BECAUSE HE WAS TAKING
   THE DANCE COMPANY ON TOUR,

    AND THEY WERE TRAVELING
         ALL THE TIME.
    AND I WOULD HAVE TO SAY,
            FOR ME,
    IT'S THAT I WOULD NEVER
       START ORGANIZING.

          - ALL RIGHT.
   THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
        WE'RE GONNA SEE
       IF THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS,

        SO STAY WITH US.

    GENTLEMEN, IF YOUR FIRST
    ENCOUNTER WITH YOUR WIFE

   WAS A HUNTING EXPEDITION,
      DID SHE SAY SHE WAS
     THE UNSUSPECTING PREY,
   THE PREDATOR ON THE PROWL,

      OR DID YOU BOTH HAVE
   INSTANT ANIMAL ATTRACTION?
              DAN.
   - I GOTTA SAY WE BOTH HAD
   INSTANT ANIMAL ATTRACTION.

             - YES?
          - OH, YEAH.
     WE WERE JUST SUPPOSED
     TO GO OUT FOR DINNER,
    AND IT ENDED UP TURNING
   INTO THIS 12-HOUR ODYSSEY.

   YOU KNOW, WE WERE WALKING
       ALL OVER THE CITY.
    WE WENT TO A SPEAKEASY.
    WE SAW THE PRIDE PARADE.
     WE SPENT ALL THIS TIME
           TOGETHER.

            IT WAS--
         IT WAS GREAT.
