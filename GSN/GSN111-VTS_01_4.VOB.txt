          - ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

       UNSUSPECTING PREY.
   - IT'S TRUE, OUR FIRST <i>DATE</i>
         <i>WAS LIKE THAT,</i>
     BUT WHEN WE FIRST MET,
  YOU WERE, LIKE, ALL OVER ME,

       'CAUSE YOU THOUGHT
     WE WERE BEING SET UP.
            - RIGHT.
- IN A GOOD WAY, IN A GOOD WAY.
            - STEVE,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

       - I'D LOVE TO SAY
   INSTANT ANIMAL ATTRACTION,
   BUT I'M NOT THAT AWESOME.
        SHE MADE ME WALK
     SEVEN FEET BEHIND HER

    THE FIRST NIGHT WE MET,
  SO I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY
   SHE IS UNSUSPECTING PREY.
           - SHE WAS
     THE UNSUSPECTING PREY?

   - WHAT DOES YOUR WIFE SAY?
     PREDATOR ON THE PROWL.
    - I TOLD YOU I LOVED YOU
        THE SECOND DAY.

- YOU TELL SOMEBODY YOU LOVE 'EM
      ON THE SECOND DATE,
  THEY GOT SOMETHING GOING ON.
        - SIX YEARS AGO.
      - YEAH, I THINK SO.

    TOM, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
       - OH, WE BOTH HAD
   INSTANT ANIMAL ATTRACTION.
     - WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

    - OUR FIRST CONVERSATION
      WAS TEN HOURS LONG.
      WE TALKED ALL NIGHT
    UNTIL WE HAD TO, LIKE--
      UNTIL A TAXI DRIVER
 HAD TO ACTUALLY ALMOST PUT HER

  IN A TAXI AND TAKE HER AWAY
       THE NEXT MORNING.
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.
             - WOW.
    WELL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

          - I SAID...
  - INSTANT ANIMAL ATTRACTION!
     [cheers and applause]
              YES.
           ALL RIGHT,
         NEXT QUESTION.

  GENTLEMEN, EVERY WOMAN LOVES
         A STRONG MAN.
   SO WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY
     IS THE BIGGEST MUSCLE
         ON YOUR BODY?

             STEVE.
            - ARMS.
          - YOUR ARMS?
   - CAN I SEE--CAN YOU FLEX?

            YEA--OH!
     [cheers and applause]
             YEAH!

     AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      YOU HAVE THE BICEPS.
           ALL RIGHT.
          - THANK YOU.

         - TOM, YOU'RE
      OVER THERE SMILING.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I THINK SHE WOULD ALSO
        HAVE SAID ARMS.

          - THE ARMS?
     YOU GOT THE BIG ARMS?
      - WELL...BIG ENOUGH.
  - DID YOU SAY "BIG ENOUGH,"
           THE ARMS?

          - THEY ARE,
        BUT I SAID LEGS.
     - DAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - I THINK CHEST.
  I THINK SHE LIKES MY CHEST.

            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.
       I DON'T MANSCAPE.
           [laughter]

       AND SO, YOU KNOW,
 SHE KIND OF RUBS A LITTLE BIT.
            - YEAH.
          - YOU KNOW.
          - ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     - I DO LOVE HIS CHEST,
        BUT I SAID ARMS.
             - OOH.
 - BUT I LOVE YOUR CHEST A LOT.
         - OKAY. GOOD.

          HERE WE GO.
  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       WHEN WE FIRST MET,
    I WONDERED IF MY HUSBAND

      WAS THE TYPE OF GUY
 WHO WOULD NEVER STOP BLANKING.
       AND HE WAS WORRIED
  THAT I WAS THE TYPE OF GIRL
     WHO WOULD NEVER START
           BLANKING.

              DAN.
    - I WAS THE TYPE OF GUY
      WHO WOULD NEVER STOP
      PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

  AND SHE WAS THE TYPE OF GIRL
    WHO WOULD NEVER START...
             UM...
   ALSO PLAYING VIDEO GAMES?
         I DON'T KNOW.
          - ALL RIGHT.

  ADRIENNE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
 - YAY! THAT'S WHAT I SAID TOO!
  - TALKING ABOUT VIDEO GAMES,
 GETTING INTO VIDEO GAMES! YES!
       DAN AND ADRIENNE,
    YOU ARE NOW IN THE LEAD.

           OKAY, TOM,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - I WAS THE GUY
 THAT WOULD NEVER STOP SMILING.
      AND SHE WAS THE TYPE
    WHO WOULD NEVER START...

           FROWNING.
           [laughter]
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?

         - WELL, I SAID
      SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
          - TOURING...
- YOU WOULD NEVER STOP TOURING.
     - AND SHE WOULD NEVER
       START ORGANIZING.

         - ORGANIZING.
        - I'M SO SORRY.
       - SHE'S SO RIGHT.
      - ALL RIGHT, STEVE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

    - I WOULD NEVER STOP...
            FARTING?
           [laughter]

     - OKAY. AND SHE WOULD
     NEVER START BLANKING.
            - UM...
         BEING QUIETER,
        LESS TALKATIVE.

           [laughter]
           - OH, BOY.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       TAKING CARE OF ME
        AND EXERCISING.

         I'M SO SORRY.

       SO ARE YOU READY?

       GIVING OUT DEGREES
      BASED ON YOUR WIFE'S
        SEXUAL HISTORY,

    WOULD SHE RECEIVE A PhD,
      A BACHELOR'S DEGREE,
        OR A HIGH SCHOOL
      EQUIVALENCY DIPLOMA?

            MICHAEL,
     WE'LL START WITH YOU.
  - I'LL GO BACHELOR'S DEGREE.
     - A BACHELOR'S DEGREE?

 - WE'LL SHOOT FOR THE MIDDLE.
    - SHOOT FOR THE MIDDLE.
       YOU CAN'T GO WRONG
      IN THE MIDDLE, HUH?

        WHAT'S ONE ITEM
    YOUR WIFE HAS SO MANY OF

   YOU COULD AUCTION THEM OFF
            ON EBAY
  AND SHE'D NEVER EVEN NOTICE?
             DAVID.
           - WELL...

         OUR BED IS UP
         ON BED LIFTS,
 AND IT'S FOR ONE REASON ONLY.
   IT'S BECAUSE SHE HAS ABOUT
      100 POUNDS OF MAKEUP

          UNDERNEATH.
           - GOTCHA.
       ALL RIGHT, JOSHUA.

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
      HER FRIEND JENNIFER

       BECAUSE, UM, WELL,
  SHE HASN'T BEEN MARRIED YET,
    AND SHE DOESN'T PLAN ON
  GETTING MARRIED ANYTIME SOON
   BECAUSE SHE LIKES TO KEEP
    HER MEN AT ARM'S LENGTH.

           - MM-HMM.
     - SHE'S PRETTY DEADLY,
       FROM WHAT I HEAR.

      YOU HAVE SO MANY OF

THAT YOUR HUSBAND SAID HE COULD
    AUCTION THEM OFF ON EBAY
  AND YOU'D NEVER EVEN NOTICE.
            DAWN...

          OH! MAKEUP.
     I HAVE SO MUCH MAKEUP
   THAT HE CAN AUCTION IT OFF
            ON EBAY.
    ABSOLUTELY, HANDS DOWN,
           MY MAKEUP.

         - WHERE DO YOU
       KEEP YOUR MAKEUP?
   - I HAVE OUR BED ON LIFTS,
        AND I HAVE PILES
     OF MAKEUP UNDER THERE.

         - OKAY, WELL,
   WHAT DO YOUR HUSBAND SAY?
     [cheers and applause]
            - WHOO!

       ALL RIGHT, REGINE,
       WHAT DO YOU HAVE?

    - I HAVE A LOT OF SHOES.
            - SHOES?

      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

  - I WOULD SAY SHOES AS WELL.
       - ALL RIGHT, WELL,
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY?
     [cheers and applause]
        CONGRATULATIONS.

      ALL RIGHT, COUPLES,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
     IF <i>THE DEADLIEST CATCH</i>

         WAS THE TITLE
      OF A TV DATING SHOW,
     WHICH OF YOUR FRIENDS
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
      HE WOULD CAST FIRST?

            REGINE?
           - JESSICA?
    - OKAY, WELL, LET'S SEE
        WHO JOSHUA SAID.

         WHO'D YOU SAY?
       [audience "oohs"]
          - MY SISTER?
           [laughter]

        SHE SAID FRIEND.
          THE FRIEND.
 - BUT APPARENTLY HE'S THINKING
    ABOUT YOUR SISTER, GIRL.
       - I'M NOT THINKING
        ABOUT HER, NOW.

      - KIND OF FIX IT UP,
           FIX IT UP.
        OKAY, JENNIFER,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
       - I FEEL LIKE THIS
        CAN GO ANY WAY,

  BUT THERE'S ONE FRIEND THAT
  HE THINKS JUST TALKS A LOT.
        SO...I WOULD SAY
        MY FRIEND DIANA.
     I LOVE HER AND I KNOW
       HE LOVES HER TOO,

     BUT...I KNOW HE THINKS
     SHE TALKS A LOT, SO--
       - WHO DID YOU SAY?
             - OHH.

    - YOU ALWAYS TALK ABOUT
   SHE'S BEAUTIFUL AND STUFF,
     AND I PLEAD THE FIFTH.
        - OH, I'M SORRY.
          - IT'S OKAY.

        ALL RIGHT, DAWN,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
      - I WOULD THINK THAT
   JESSICA WOULD BE THE ONE.
      - AND WHY WOULD YOU
          SAY JESSICA?

  - JESSICA HAS A GREAT BODY,
       AND I THINK HE HAS
     THE SAME TASTE AS ME.
          - ALL RIGHT.

    - SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
             - OHH!
 - WHAT THAT--JENNIFER AS WELL?
         - JENNIFER HAS
       A GREAT BODY TOO.

       I COULDN'T DECIDE.
     - SHE'S A LOT DEADLIER
 THAN JESSICA, THAT'S FOR SURE.
           [laughter]
        - SO YOU HEARD!

             OHH...
     [cheers and applause]

   [cat calls from audience]
            MM-HMM.

- HE MIGHT REALLY GET MAD AT ME
         IF I SAY THIS,
        BUT I WOULD ADD
          ANOTHER TOY.
        - AS OPPOSED TO
    ALL THE OTHER ONES OR...

   TO HAVE A PLEASURE CHEST.

          LADIES, NAME
     ONE PERSONALITY TRAIT
     YOU HOPE YOUR CHILDREN
         WON'T INHERIT
       FROM YOUR HUSBAND.

             DAWN.
            - HIS...
         NOT DOING WHAT
     HE SAYS HE'S GONNA DO.

             - OHH.
     - I CAN'T STAND THAT.
    AND HE DOES IT SO OFTEN.
       I LOVE HIM, BUT...
       - DOES HE FORGET?

    - NO, HE DOESN'T FORGET.
     HE JUST DOESN'T DO IT.
    - HE JUST DOESN'T DO IT.
           - [laughs]
      - GOTCHA. ALL RIGHT,
    REGINE, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

      - HIS COMEDIC SIDE.
             UM...
           [laughter]
       - YOU DON'T--WAIT!

    YOU DON'T WANT THE KIDS
           TO GET IT?
     - NO, NO, HE IS FUNNY
      WHEN HE--SOMETIMES.
      BUT SOMETIMES, LIKE,
           JUST STOP.

        IT'S NOT FUNNY.
           YOU KNOW?
     - ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - OKAY, HERE'S THE THING.

     I COMPLETELY LOVE HIM,
  BUT HE DOES HAVE A TENDENCY
  TO BE A LITTLE BIT...BOSSY.

            - OKAY.
        - SO, YOU KNOW,
      HE'LL TRY--NOT BOSSY
         IN A BAD WAY.
            I--LIKE,
    I'LL BE COOKING DINNER,

         AND HE'LL SAY,
        "OH, NO, NO, NO.
     YOU'RE--YOU'RE ADDING
TOO MUCH BUTTER," OR WHATEVER--
  - HE'S GOT SOMETHING TO SAY
      FOR A LOT OF THINGS.

   - LIKE, "OH, LET ME HELP."
 BUT HE'S TRYING TO BE HELPFUL.
       - OKAY, I GOT IT.

   - IT'S ANNOYING SOMETIMES.
            - OKAY.
    AND NOW A QUESTION FROM
     AIR WICK SCENTED OILS
     WINTER LUXURY EDITION,

   A COLLECTION OF INDULGENT
      SEASONAL FRAGRANCES.
 IF YOUR HUSBAND WERE PLANNING
    THE IDEAL DATE FOR YOU,
        WHERE WOULD THIS
     LUXURIOUS NIGHT BEGIN?

            REGINE?
  - HE LOVES TO GO OUT TO EAT.
    IT WOULD PROBABLY START
 AT A NICE ROMANTIC RESTAURANT.

         - AND YOU TOO?
  DO YOU LIKE TO EAT AS WELL?
          - YES, I DO.
      I ENJOY FOOD, HONEY.
           [laughter]

     - I KNOW, YOU TALKING
         TO ONE, GIRL.
      ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
    - I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE
  TO GO ALONG THE SAME LINES.

           - MM-HMM.
          - YOU KNOW,
       WE'RE BOTH ITALIAN
    AND HE LOVES HIS PASTA.

    SO I FEEL THAT HE WOULD
LIKE A NICE ITALIAN COOKED MEAL
 AT A NICE ITALIAN RESTAURANT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     DAWN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - WELL, SINCE WE'RE SUCH
          BIG FOODIES,
     WE'RE DEFINITELY GONNA
         START THAT OFF
    WITH A NICE RESTAURANT.

       - ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
 NOW HERE'S OUR BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.

          HERE WE GO.
        LADIES, COMPLETE
         THIS SENTENCE.
         "THE ONE THING
      ON MY HUSBAND'S BODY

  "THAT KIND OF CREEPS ME OUT
         IS HIS BLANK.
   "BUT WHEN I SEE HIS BLANK,
         I WANNA CREEP
       A LITTLE CLOSER."

           [laughter]
           JENNIFER.
 - YOU KNOW, HE'S A LITTLE BIT
        SELF-CONSCIOUS.

   HE DOES HAVE A LITTLE BIT
       OF A BUBBLE BUTT.
            - OKAY.
            - SO...
  BUT I FEEL LIKE HE'S A LIT--

        DON'T LOOK AT IT
       WHEN HE WALKS OUT.
         BUT I FEEL...
           [laughter]
    - GIRL, YOU KNOW THAT'S

        THE FIRST THING
   WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT!
             WHAT?
         - HE'S REALLY
    SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT IT.

    'CAUSE SOMETIMES HE DOES
   KNOCK THINGS OVER WITH IT.
            - OKAY.
      - BUT I FEEL LIKE...
           [laughter]
           LATELY...

      I FEEL LIKE LATELY,
  SINCE WE'VE GOTTEN MARRIED,
     HE'S A LITTLE BIT MORE
SELF CONSCIOUS ABOUT HIS BELLY.
       SO I WILL SAY THAT
        THAT KIND OF...

  CREEPS ME OUT A LITTLE BIT,
          'CAUSE IT'S
       GOTTEN A LITTLE...
           - GOT LOW.
     - GOT A LITTLE PAUNCH.

            - YEAH.
  - SO I'M GONNA GO WITH THAT.
    I'M GONNA SAY HIS BELLY,
    BUT WHEN I SEE HIS EYES

    IT MAKES ME WANNA CREEP
      A LITTLE BIT CLOSER.
          - AW. OKAY.
  - HE'S GOT REALLY NICE EYES.
     YOU CAN LOOK AT THOSE.
        - SO HIS BELLY?

        - I WILL LOOK--
WELL, I WANNA LOOK AT HIS BUTT.
          I'M GONNA--
      CAN I LOOK AT BOTH?
       IS IT OKAY IF I--
       - SURE, GO AHEAD.

         - OKAY, GREAT.
           THANK YOU.
   WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, DAWN?
  - BACK IN HIS MILITARY DAYS,
   HE DECIDED TO GO TO A BAR

 WHERE THEY HAD A TATTOO PARLOR
   AND HE ENDED UP WITH THIS
  SKULL TATTOO ON HIS STOMACH.
AND AS HE'S BEEN GAINING WEIGHT

     IT'S KIND OF EXPANDING
      INTO A HORSE SKULL.
           [laughing]
   - WOW, SO IT'S GOTTEN THIS
       REALLY LONG FACE?

     - IT'S GETTING THERE.
    SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
    THAT THAT CREEPS ME OUT,
   HIS TATTOO ON HIS STOMACH.
       - OKAY, SO TATTOO.

            GOT YOU.
- BUT WHEN I LOOK AT HIS SMILE,
     I WANNA CREEP CLOSER.
       I LOVE HIS SMILE.
 - HE'S GOT A BEAUTIFUL SMILE.

       - FIRST THING THAT
      ATTRACTED ME TO HIM.
            - OKAY.
       ALL RIGHT, REGINE,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

          - IT'S FUNNY
     YOU ASK THIS QUESTION
     'CAUSE WE WERE TALKING
   ABOUT THIS THE OTHER DAY.
            - OKAY.
     - IT WAS THE STOMACH.

  JUST LIKE THE OTHER LADIES,
           ACTUALLY.
 'CAUSE WE EAT A LOT SOMETIMES.
            WELL...
      WELL, WE EAT A LOT.

        JUST IN GENERAL.
           - UH-HUH.
  - DEFINITELY HIS SMILE ALSO.
   I TOLD HIM THAT YESTERDAY.
      - REALLY, HIS SMILE?
         - HIS SMILE'S

   WHAT ATTRACTED ME TO YOU.
          - ALL RIGHT!

      Thank you very much.
   Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.
           It's been
     a terrific week here.
       I hope you had fun
          joining us.

   Today is gonna be another
  good day, I can promise you.
    There's always something
  very special about a Friday
  because everybody's looking
     forward to the weekend

 and we want to give everybody
   money to make them happy.
   You feel like Santa Claus?
    I feel like Santa Claus
     and gives you a chance

     to get home and rest
 and lie down for the weekend.
Sure.
And bask by the pool
and stuff.
Do nothing,
just lie around.

                     Do nothing.
               Oh, this man is--
      They put a key in his back
  and wind him up every morning.
         He never stops
       for three months.

I do have a busy
weekend coming up.
      But we're gonna make
    Jackie Smith very happy
'cause you'll give her
so much money,

she's tell all her friends.
What are you up to
these days, Jackie?
          Well, I just graduated
           from Long Beach State

         with a degree in Radio
           and TV broadcasting.
A-ha!
And I'm looking for a job
so I'm kind of relaxing
right now.
Now, Jackie, this,
this is what we call

     a television studio.
               I know all of it.
      The lights up here.
   You know all that stuff.
       I know all of that stuff.
 Much good luck in that field.

   Jaime, how are you, sir?
                     Very good.
    I realized the other day
    that I had argyle's socks on
 and it helped us with David.
So you left them?

Yeah, I have those
plus other props.
I have a cross
and masusa, earrings,
bracelet, pantyhose,
anything you can

You can point it
that's the way it is.
Simply how we won this game.
That's how you won the game
with the argyle socks.
         That's right.
  Dave Nicholson, how much money
  have you won so far?

                        $20,750.
A little trip to London,
a little video camera recorder.
                   That's right.
Good stuff.

Much good luck to all of you,
ladies and gentlemen.
 You know our Winner's Circle.
     We'll talk about that
    when we get there later.

     These are the subjects

Let's go

     [audience applauding]

      [indistinct chatter]
 Tell you what, Dave.
If you win this $10,000,
I personally will see

that you get $30,750.
How about that?
      Sounds like a deal.
 Since you won $20,000...

Uh, that would be
very, very nice.
        Yes, it would.

           I couldn't get you...
You know, what?

Nothing wrong with your clues,

       Things on a nest.
You see bird eggs.
You got it.
       Things in a nest.

        in his mind.

                           Yeah.
       I'm was thinking
   on stepping on the eggs.
Uh, $250--
Is that where you were?
             Yeah.
     Don't step on the droppings
     or the eggs.

        Good advice.
        $250, $300, $400-- $550.
            We'll be right back.
          Right, David, I tried.

    We love the sun 'n water

          so we use new

       Wet 'n Clear.
             It sprays clear on
             wet skin

               while most sprays
              go
              on white 'n messy.
      We get broad spectrum
           protection

    when we splish 'n splash
       with new Coppertone
          Wet 'n Clear.
              Coppertone.
              Embrace the sun.

 You don't, you don't know what
you just did to me on a Friday.
      I looked over there,
         wait a minute!

Get a picture.
Get a fore shot of this.
      Oh, he did notice.
You, son of a gun.
          He noticed.
(Betty) We thought
you'd never know.

We thought you'd never do that.
 See a good host would know that
     before the cameras went on.
                         (Betty)
                           Yeah.

         Well, I was--
     To tell you the truth,
I was looking at who's gonna be
here next week.
I'll get rid of you two

and I don't worry
about this stuff.
 Alright, let's switch place.
     David, you come over here.
   Next week Audrey Landers
     from "A Chorus Line"
   and "Dallas" will be here.

  Brian Mitchell, a young man
   from "Trapper John, M.D."
    And I'll be glad to get
   rid of these two loonies.
And then I don't have to worry
    about exchanging seats.
               I...It wasn't...

         I'm in where I belong?
               I didn't move...
It wasn't your idea?
                         (Jamie)
                  No, it wasn't.
                   It was, uh...
           It was David's idea.
             Yeah.

     He's got all this money now
     and he doesn't care.
You would, you were hoping
I'll just go on down the line
weren't you?
By route no less.

      David, you won $550.
        You're partnered
       with Betty White.
 And we're gonna send her back
     to the "Golden Girls"

     as soon as we get rid
          of her here.
Uh, see tomorrow night
at 9 o'clock at NBC.
Is that true?
       Thank you, Dick.
            Uh-huh.

       Okay.
       Jamie, you're up in deck.
           Jamie and Jackie,
           there's a combination
 if ever there was.

 We have The Lei Of The Land,
       Beam Me Up Scotty,
   Come Out Wherever You Are,
     I Never Forget A Face,
       Fast And Furious,

         Time Is Money.
  And, uh, I guess you noticed
          the spelling
 on Lei of the Land and I don't
    have to talk about that.

     We've got a Mystery 7
     that's more important.
      And if you get that
          7 out of 7,
   you'll win an automobile,
            folks.
                             Oh.

         Brand new set of wheels
         over there.
Jackie,

       How about Time Is Money?
        It's up to you.

         Time Is Money,
          Jackie said.
Time Is Money
is the first choice.
   Alright, let's move along
           with it.

                 A Learjet, 747.

No, its...
        [buzzer sounds]
Concorde was what
we're looking for.
      Sorry, abbreviation
         was the word.

That was a tough break.
     [audience applauding]
      The abbreviation and
the Concorde did you in, folks.

      You've got 3 points.
     We'll see what happens
          to them now.
Betty, what would you like?

       Fast And Furious.

          out of there
         and win a car.
           Come on.
             Beam Me Up Scotty.

We'll write that one down
for posterity.
       And that's all she wrote.
Alright, folks,
we're gonna go for $25,000.

Add that to the prior winnings,
it comes up to $45,750.
Good luck.
Let's do it.
Here is your first subject.
Go!

       Uh, the bride, the groom.
Things in a wedding.
                         Uh-hmm.
     [audience applauding]

            Oh, I'm hanging here
                     in a bunch.
         And if they pick me...
What a banana might say.
   They'll make wine out of me.
What a grape might say.

                         Uh-huh.
     [audience applauding]
            Uh, hor's d'oeuvres,

                   potato chips.
Snacks.
                         Uh-hmm.
     [audience applauding]

                       A girdle.
Things that women wear.
                     Uh, a belt.
 Things that are tight.

     [audience applauding]
                       Uh, uh...
               Snapping fingers.

 Things that click.
     [audience applauding]
             A good game player.

People that win.
Things that win.
                   A smart fox.
        [buzzer sounds]
                       Oh, damn!

     [audience applauding]
        What did I say?
Betty, he doesn't
know what it is.

                             Oh.
Forget you said that,
what else would you do?
A good game player.
                 I have no idea.
   She used a synonym for a word
   that we need up there.

       Oh, I could kill myself.
    Clever, clever things.
Clever, yeah, clever.
It's...
That's not...

     I get so brainwashed to try
               to use a modifier
           to really describe it
    but then you modify yourself
          right down the toilet.
That's the dangerous part
about that chair.

People say,
"Well, what makes it,
that game so tough?
It's easy for me
I play it all the time.
 I win all the time at home."

You get in that chair...
                             Oh.
And you're mind's
running 90 miles an hour,
you're trying real hard.
       Oh, Dave, I am so sorry.

           Yeah, no.
                But yoll have
            another shot at it.
         That's right.
Yeah, he's gonna be back
on Monday.
            Darling, I'm sorry.
And he's got tons of money.

     And I'm out of the business
             that's what you're
                 trying to say.
You never ever
darken my doorstep again,
woman.
                         I know.

         And I don't deserve to.
You're terrific.
$750, we'll be right back.
             I'm so sorry, Dave.
                 I mean I tried.

       IT WAS LIKE A RED RASH...
               VERY SORE LOOKING
               KINDA BLISTERY.
     [audience applauding]
  LIKE SOMEBODY HAD SET A BAG
  OF HOT CHARCOAL ON MY NECK.

      I WAS A FIREFIGHTER
      FOR 24 YEARS.
 BUT, I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED
 SUCH A BURNING SENSATION
   UNTIL I HAD THE SHINGLES.

 I REMEMBER IT WELL. I WAS IN
 THE BACK YARD DOING YARD WORK.
  I HAD THIS IRRITATION GOING
  ON IN MY LOWER NECK.
  I CHANGED SHIRTS BECAUSE I
  THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING

   IN THE COLLAR OF THE SHIRT
   IRRITATING MY NECK.
   AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
   WHAT WAS GOING ON.
     I HAD NO IDEA IT
     CAME FROM CHICKENPOX.

 I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHINGLES WAS
 ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE...
    A LOT OLDER THAN MYSELF.
I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE,

           IT IS BAD.
    IT'S SOMETHING YOU
    NEVER WANT TO ENCOUNTER.

She's gonna spend the weekend
going to every reference book.
                         I know.
   No, no I'm still working
         on presented.
  I'm still working on that.
From yesterday.

Oh, I'm still working on that.
  I don't have time for this.
Jackie...
You have won $1,100
at the Pyramid.
                         Thanks.
            Thank you very much.
            Have a good weekend.

Jaime, the same to you.
       Thank you, Dick.
Come back
        It's been fun.
      Dave, you're gonna be back
      on Monday to add more

        to the $22,050
        you have already
        and the London trip
        and the video--
        22,050, I thought
        it was more than that.

                  I think it is.
      It only would have.
It doesn't matter.
I'll figure it out by Monday
rest assured.

Betty, we'll see you tomorrow
night on "Golden Girls."
           You bet.
    For now, I'm Dick Clark.
            So long.
