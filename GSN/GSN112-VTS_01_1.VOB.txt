BOY, THIS NAME IS WORKING ME.
              HI.

 WE'RE SPREADING THE WORD ABOUT
 NEW HONEY BUNCHES OF OATS
   FRUIT BLENDS AND THEIR
   UNIQUE TASTE COMBINATIONS.
     LIKE PEACH/RASPBERRY.

 WITH ONE FLAVOR IN THE GRANOLA
 BUNCH AND ONE ON THE FLAKE.
   TWO FLAVORS.
                   IN HARMONY.
     HONEY BUNCHES OF OATS.

 MAKE YOUR DAY BUNCHES BETTER.
      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,

  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.

     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.

IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,

      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.

   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.

      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,

    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.

    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,

    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.

  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.

 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.
