   I MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THERE,
       BUT IN HIGH SCHOOL
      I FEEL LIKE MY WIFE
       WAS A TOTAL BLANK.
             COREY?
        - MAYBE A NERD.

   - YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR WIFE
       WAS A TOTAL NERD?
    - A LITTLE NERD, MAYBE.

     BE A DEFINITE TOMBOY?
  - SHE'S DEFINITELY A TOMBOY,
    THAT'S KIND OF THE WAY--
  WHERE I'D GO WITH THAT ONE.

      - ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
 OUR FINAL QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
    I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT
 WAS CUTE THAT I SHARE MY NAME
      WITH A SPANISH WINE,
            SHERRY.

       [audience laughs]
     SHE HAS HER OWN DRINK
        THAT SHE MAKES.
          SHE CALLS IT
  "STACY'S SUNFIRE SURPRISE."

         WHAT IS THAT--
     - IT'S CRYSTAL LIGHT,
         WITH NO WATER,
           AND VODKA.

     THE--SAYING THE PAPER.

            - YEAH.

       SO I WOULD SAY HE
   WOULD SAY I'M A JOKESTER?
     - SAM, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

          I GAVE YOUR
       HUSBAND THE ANSWER
         AND HE HAD TO
     TELL ME THE QUESTION.
         SO THE ANSWER
        WAS "YOUR BUTT."

          SO ACCORDING

     THE QUESTION WOULD BE,
         WHAT IS BLANK?

            SIMONE?
        "WHAT IS ROUND?"
    OOH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

       - "WHAT IS JUICY?"
  - HE'S ALWAYS SQUEEZING IT.

     - HE LIKES TO SQUEEZE?
 - AND I THINK IT'S JUICY, YES.
    - STEVEN IS A SQUEEZER?
       - I BELIEVE--YUP.
        - WHAT IS JUICY.

   - SO I THINK HE WOULD SAY
        "WHAT IS JUICY?"
      - ALL RIGHT, STEVEN.

  IT'S MY FAVORITE BODY PART.

     - OH, WHAT'D YOU PUT?

   FAVORITE BODY PART, SO...

      NOT TOO GOOD, CLOSE.

     KNEW YOUR HUSBAND BEST
   DURING HIS COLLEGE YEARS?

         THE LIBRARIAN,
   THE COOK AT THE CAFETERIA,

           - JESSICA?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
     THE, UM, LIQUOR STORE.

- THE LADY AT THE LIQUOR STORE.
        BECAUSE STEVEN'S
   WORKED HARD OVER THE YEARS
  AND IN STUDYING I KNOW THAT
 HE LIKES TO TAKE THAT EDGE OFF

 AND NOTHING TAKES THE EDGE OFF
LIKE A NICE DRINK, A TALL GLASS.
      - LIKE A TALL GLASS.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
          - ALL RIGHT.

 THIS NEXT QUESTION IS FROM OUR
 FASHIONABLE FRIENDS AT MACY'S.
     WHICH ITEM IN YOUR OWN
       FASHION COLLECTION
       WOULD YOUR HUSBAND
       WANT TO SEE ON YOU

          WHILE YOU'RE
  STRUTTING DOWN THE CATWALK?
            SIMONE?

           - NOTHING?

           - NOTHING.
 - ALL RIGHT, I THINK WE CAN--
  - NOTHING FROM THE WARDROBE.
      - IF YOU WANNA WALK
  ON THAT CATWALK IN NOTHING,

    THEN THERE YOU GO, GIRL.
     [cheers and applause]
          YEAH! KATIE?

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
     A LITTLE BLACK DRESS.
    - A LITTLE BLACK DRESS?
             - YES.
          - ALL RIGHT.

    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION,
        IT IS TWO PARTS,
          EACH PART IS
        WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
 THE ONE FRIEND OF MY HUSBAND'S
      WHO IS SO ANNOYING,
   THAT I WOULD LOVE TO ISSUE

      A RESTRAINING ORDER
     AGAINST HIM IS BLANK,
    BUT THE ONE FRIEND OF MY
    HUSBAND'S WHO IS SO HOT,
     THAT I ALWAYS HAVE TO

     RESTRAIN MYSELF AROUND
           IS BLANK?
            JESSICA?
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH
      THE MOST ANNOYING--

     WAS IT MOST ANNOYING?
             - YES.
        - WOULD BE BERT.
            - BERT?

      - BECAUSE BERT JUST
    CARRIES ON AND ON AND ON
      AND HE NEVER LEAVES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    - SO THAT WOULD BE BERT.

         AND I RESTRAIN
         MYSELF FROM--
          WOW, THAT'S
       A TOUGH ONE, UM--
         - HIS NAME IS
       NOT ERNIE, IS IT?

     - NO, IT'S NOT ERNIE.
      - OKAY, JUST SAYIN'.
      - THERE'S A BERT BUT
     THERE ISN'T AN ERNIE.
            - OKAY.

 - UM, I'M GONNA GO WITH LUKE.
          - WITH LUKE?
       - LUKE IS A REALLY
         ATTRACTIVE GUY
         AND I'M GONNA
         GO WITH LUKE.

       SO I WOULD HAVE TO
   RESTRAIN MYSELF FROM LUKE.
       - WITH LUKE, OKAY.
            - MM-HM.
