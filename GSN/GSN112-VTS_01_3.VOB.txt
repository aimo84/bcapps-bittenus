     - YOU SAY NONE, BUT IF

         THE WAY I PUT
      MY OUTFITS TOGETHER.

     SOMETIMES I DRESS HIM.
    HE'S LIKE MY PAPER DOLL.
            - OKAY.
            - SO...
   I THINK THAT HE WOULD SAY
          TRENDSETTER.

          - SO HOW DID
 YOUR LITTLE PAPER DOLL ANSWER?
         A TRENDSETTER.
             - YES!

   SHE PICKED OUT THIS SHIRT.
        - AH, IT'S NICE.

          - THANK YOU.
          - I LOVE IT.
     SARAH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - I'D ALSO SAY TRENDSETTER,

   'CAUSE HE ALWAYS TELLS ME
   I'M MY OWN PERSON, AND...
         I THINK I AM.
       - WHAT DO YOU SAY?
       YOU LOOK SO GLUM.

           [laughter]
       - I'M DOIN' GREAT.

       HOW ARE YOU DOIN'?
       - TREND FOLLOWER.
  - HE SAID A TREND FOLLOWER.
            - WHAT?

         YOU ARE NUTS.
          - IT'S OKAY.
    - HE TRIES TO ROPE ME IN
           WITH HIM.

       - YEAH, BUT I LOVE
       WHAT YOU HAVE ON.
         THIS IS GREAT.
    - THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
        - IT LOOKS GOOD.
        GOOD JOB, SARAH.

           ALL RIGHT.
    JANELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - I'M DEFINITELY
         A TRENDSETTER.
         - TRENDSETTER.

     - ACTUALLY, I MAKE HIM
           LOOK GOOD.
        - THERE YOU GO.
    - I MADE HIM LOOK GOOD.
         - YEAH, RIGHT.

      - HE WAS A HOT MESS
        WHEN HE MET ME.
          I WAS LIKE,
     "OH, I CAN DRESS HIM."
   THAT'S WHY I MARRIED HIM.

          - ALL RIGHT.

           ALL RIGHT.
      LADIES, THIS IS OUR
        FINAL QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

  "LUMPY" IS THE PERFECT WORD
  TO DESCRIBE MY WIFE'S BLANK.
             SARAH.
      - DEFINITELY CHEST.

   - YOUR CHEST IS NOT LUMPY.
           - [laughs]
     WELL, NOTHING ELSE IS.
           [laughter]

     - ALL RIGHT, KENNETH,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           THE CHEST!
           - FINALLY!
            FINALLY!

    [laughter and applause]
- AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU DIDN'T SAY
       "MASHED POTATOES"?

             - YES.
  - THAT WAS MY FIRST THOUGHT.
           - JANELL.
      - MY BIG OLD BOOTY.
     - YOUR BIG OLD BOOTY.

  - THAT'S WHY HE MARRIED ME.
        - ANTHONY, IS IT
      THAT BIG OLD BOOTY?
   - IT'S THAT BIG OLD BOOTY!
            - YEAH!

     [cheers and applause]
- THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
            - WHOO!
            YOLANDA.

    - OH, I HATE TO SAY THIS
        ON NATIONAL TV,
     BUT PROBABLY MY BELLY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, JAMES?

      - FIRST OFF, I SAID,
         "WHAT BELLY?"
          AND THEN...
        - THERE YOU GO.
     - BUT UNFORTUNATELY--

       - NOW I'M CURIOUS.
      - OKAY, YOUR PILLOW.
          - MY PILLOW?
  - I WASN'T THINKING "BODY."
       - OH, YEAH, IT IS
         KIND OF LUMPY.

 BUT I THINK OF MY BODY PARTS.
       - I KNOW, I KNOW.
        - I LOVE JAMES.
HE SAID, "I AM NOT GOING THERE."
         HE SAID I WANT
    A RESTFUL NIGHT'S SLEEP.

             MM-MM!

    IT WAS BECAUSE OF BLANK.

 SO YOU JUST REFUSE TO PUT THEM

 HE HAS THIS LITTLE PATCH HERE.

        BATMAN'S SYMBOL.

             - YEAH

 HE'S, LIKE, RIGHT IN BETWEEN,
  NOT LIKE THE WOLFMAN, BUT...

       - MY FRIEND JOANI.

    - SHE WAS MORE EXCITED.
    SHE WAS EXCITED FOR US.
        SHE WANTED THIS
    RELATIONSHIP TO HAPPEN.

            - OKAY.
  AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, YOLANDA?
       - HIS BEST FRIEND
      IN FLORIDA, DERRICK,
   BECAUSE JAMES IS THE LAST
 OF HIS FRIENDS TO GET MARRIED.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.

        THAT ONE OF US--
     OR WE WERE TOO TIRED,
 BECAUSE OFTENTIMES, WE JUST--
  WHEN WE GET HOME, WE'LL JUST
     FALL ASLEEP, HONESTLY.

   - YOLANDA, WHAT YOU'D SAY?

       - CAT ON THE BED.
           BLACKIE...
            - OKAY.

         - ON THE BED!

    KENNETH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - AH, IT'S GOT TO BE THE DOGS.
          - THE DOGS?
 - I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE
        THEY GOT EXCITED
AND TRIED TO JUMP IN OR BECAUSE
     THEY JUMPED THE FENCE.

    I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE,
  BUT IT'S GOT TO BE THE DOGS.
- BUT IT'S GOT TO BE THOSE DOGS.

          - THE DOGS.

     [cheers and applause]
          - GOOD JOB.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   GENTLEMEN, NEXT QUESTION.

    IF YOUR WIFE SHEARED OFF
       ALL OF YOUR WOOL,
 DID SHE SAY SHE'D HAVE ENOUGH
     TO KNIT A CUTE SWEATER
    FOR A PARROT, A POODLE,

           OR A PONY?

         TO SAY PARROT,
      BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY
   HAD TO FIND OUT ONE TIME,

      'CAUSE I LOST A BET,
       SO I'M GOING TO GO

     WHO DID YOUR WIFE SAY

 HE ACTUALLY--WHEN I TOLD HIM,
       HE SAID, "TO WHO?"
      AND HE WAS ACTUALLY

 WE WERE IN HIS HOUSE, AND SHE
 WAS ACTUALLY RIGHT BEHIND ME.

     HERE IS WHERE WE STAND
        WITH OUR SCORE.
ANTHONY AND JANELL, YOU GUYS ARE
  IN THE LEAD WITH 35 POINTS.

           IT IS TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.
     THIS QUESTION IS WORTH
        UP TO 30 POINTS.
      ARE YOU GUYS READY?

           all: YES.
    - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
WE'LL BE CELEBRATING OUR GOLDEN
   ANNIVERSARY IN A NUTHOUSE,

  BECAUSE AFTER 50 YEARS OF ME
   PUTTING UP WITH HIS BLANK
       AND HIM PUTTING UP
         WITH MY BLANK,
     WE'RE BOTH GOING TO BE
       COMPLETELY INSANE.

            KENNETH.
         - I'M A SLOB.
SO SHE WOULD HAVE TO PUT UP WITH
ME JUST BEING MESSY EVERYWHERE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
- AND THIS IS GONNA SOUND WORSE
       THAN IT REALLY IS,
   BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PUT UP
       WITH HER TALKING.

            - OKAY.
          - BECAUSE--
      - IT SOUNDS WORSE--
          - HEY. HEY.
         I DEFY ANYBODY
      TO TRY TO WATCH TV,

   AND ALL'S YOU HEAR IS THIS
         IN YOUR EAR...
       [audience groans]
        THE ENTIRE TIME.

    - YOU'RE RIGHT, KENNETH.
    THAT SOUNDS A LOT WORSE.
           - THANKS.
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?

- HIS MESSINESS AND MY NAGGING.
       - AND THE NAGGING.
      WE'LL TAKE 'EM BOTH!
              YES!
     [cheers and applause]

 ALL RIGHT, KENNETH AND SARAH,
    YOU'RE NOW IN THE LEAD.
    WE'RE GONNA GO TO JAMES.
  - I WOULD SAY SHE WOULD HAVE
  TO PUT UP WITH MY MESSINESS,

BECAUSE HONESTLY SHE GETS ON ME
     ABOUT IT ALL THE TIME,
  WHETHER IT'S THE CAT LITTER,
     WITH MY WONDERFUL CAT,

 OR JUST, YOU KNOW, NOT GETTING
        THINGS DONE IN--
     YOU KNOW, IN MY TIME,
'CAUSE SHE LIKES IT TO BE DONE,

         AND I'M LIKE,
  "OH, I'LL GET TO IT, HONEY."
  AND THEN I GET THE DAGGERS.
    - HOW LONG IS THIS STORY
       GONNA LAST, JAMES?

   - THAT'S IT, RIGHT THERE.
      - I'M JUST KIDDING.
          I'M KIDDING.
        - I WOULD SAY...
           BOSSINESS.

   - YOLANDA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
    - I SAID YOUR MESSINESS
      AND MY CLEANLINESS.
         - OH, MY GOD!
  WHY DIDN'T I THINK OF THAT?

    - SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
     [cheers and applause]
         - I DON'T MIND
   YOUR CLEANLINESS, THOUGH.

        - BUT I'M SORRY.
         UNFORTUNATELY,
    IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO WIN.
      ALL RIGHT, ANTHONY,
     WE'RE GONNA GO TO YOU.

    - I'M GONNA SAY--I HATE
  TO REPEAT EVERYBODY ELSE'S,
       BUT ME--MESSINESS,
     NOT DOING THE DISHES.
  'CAUSE I HATE DOING DISHES.
        DON'T DO DISHES.

          AND HER JUST
       ALWAYS IN MY EAR.
    NAG, NAG, NAG, NAG, NAG.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   JANELL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

    - ARGUING AND BICKERING.
          - I'M SORRY.
       WE CAN'T TAKE IT.
       - CONGRATULATIONS,
      COUPLE NUMBER THREE!

           YOU READY?

             - YEP.
  - OKAY, TAKE A DEEP BREATH.
     HERE WE GO, GENTLEMEN.
      FILL IN THE BLANK--

  YOU'VE HEARD OF PERSONAL ADS
  THAT SAY, "MUST LOVE DOGS."
    BUT IF MY WIFE MADE ONE,
       IT WOULD'VE SAID,
       "MUST LOVE BLANK."

             BRIAN.
           - [laughs]
             UM...
     I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
         MESSY EATERS,

 BECAUSE ONE OF THE FIRST TIMES
 WE ATE IN FRONT OF EACH OTHER,
          SHE ACTUALLY
    LICKED HER PLATE CLEAN.
      AND I'VE NEVER SEEN
     A HUMAN BEING DO IT--

   NOT A HUMAN PERSON DO THAT
        EVER IN MY LIFE.
    - YOU THINK IT WAS LIKE
   A PROMISE OF MORE TO COME?

          OH--NO, NO.

 PROBABLY A COUPLE OF OPTIONS.
     BUT THINKING ABOUT IT,
            I THINK
  WHAT I'M GOING TO GO FOR IS,

   MUST LOVE WATCHING SPORT.
 - YOU ARE NOT FROM THE BRONX.

   I LOVE THE ACCENT, LADIES.

      THE WIVES ARE BACK,

      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.

         SO HERE WE GO.
    LADIES, FIRST QUESTION--
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
       FILL IN THE BLANK?
  YOU'VE HEARD OF PERSONAL ADS
  THAT SAY, "MUST LOVE DOGS."

    BUT IF MY WIFE MADE ONE,
      IT WOULD HAVE SAID,
       "MUST LOVE BLANK."
             TANIA.
            - UM...

      MUST LOVE SURPRISES,
       BECAUSE OUR LIVES
      HAVE DEFINITELY BEEN
      UNEXPECTED TOGETHER
   IN LOTS OF DIFFERENT WAYS.

         UM, SO I'D SAY
      MUST LOVE SURPRISES.
   - BRIAN, DID YOU GET THOSE
UNEXPECTED MOMENTS OF SURPRISE?
         - I WAS CLOSE.
    - HE SAID MESSY EATERS.

           [laughter]
          - I KNEW IT.
 - DID YOU LICK A PLATE CLEAN?
 WAS THAT A SURPRISING MOMENT?
      - I EMBRACE THE FACT
   THAT I LICKED THAT PLATE.

    IT WAS A VERY GOOD MEAL
      THAT I MADE, AND...
      IT'S STILL SOMETHING
       I CONTINUE TO DO,
    AND I'M NOT EMBARRASSED
  OF THE PLATE LICKING, SO...

    - JEAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - EITHER HE'S GONNA SAY
         THE STEELERS,
    OR HE'S GONNA SAY WINE.

          AND I THINK
      HE'S GONNA SAY WINE.
    - GREG, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
    HE SAID WATCHING SPORTS.
             - OH!

           IT'S OVER.
         - IT IS OVER.
      - ALL RIGHT, SHEVON,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - UM, I DEFINITELY THINK
          I KNOW THIS.
             IT'S--
     IT'S MUST LOVE SPORTS.
  IT'S SPORTS 24 HOURS A DAY,

             24-7,
      ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT--
        DREAMING SPORTS.
            - JERRY.
            EATING.
             - OH.

    - IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
      WHAT YOU LIKE DOING.
       - I THOUGHT IT WAS
       - BUT IS THAT TRUE
     THAT YOU LIKE EATING?

            - I DO.
           I LOVE IT.
       - IT'S ABOUT YOU.
           SEE? SEE?
  - LADIES, WE'RE GONNA GO ON
     TO OUR NEXT QUESTION.

         WHICH OF THESE
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
         BEST DESCRIBES
    YOUR TRAVEL EXPERIENCES
    TO GIRL-ON-GIRL ISLAND--

  YOU HAVE A COUPLE OF STAMPS
       IN YOUR PASSPORT,
          YOU ONCE HAD
      A SECOND HOME THERE,
  OR HAVE YOU ALWAYS PREFERRED

      AT THE EIFFEL TOWER?
          - [giggles]
            - JEAN.

  - I GOT A COUPLE OF STAMPS.
    - YOU GOT A COUPLE OF--
      THAT'S WHAT I THINK
       YOU PUT IN THERE.

            - GREG,
   WHAT DID YOU PUT IN THERE?
   - I PUT THE EIFFEL TOWER.
            - WHAT?
     - YOU LIKE VACATIONING
      AT THE EIFFEL TOWER.

     - YOU DO LIKE CLIMBING
         ON BIG THINGS.
           [laughter]
          - ALL RIGHT,
    SHEVON, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - I HAD A SECOND HOME THERE.
       I WOULD SAY THAT.
   - JERRY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    HE SAID ALWAYS PREFERRED
VACATIONING AT THE EIFFEL TOWER.

   - WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT,
             JERRY?
      - THE EIFFEL TOWER.
           YOU LIKE--
           - NO, NO.

        - WERE YOU AWARE
  OF THE SECOND HOME IN THE--
         - UM, TELL ME.
        WHAT'S GOING ON?
           [laughter]

      - ALL RIGHT, TANIA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - I'M GONNA GO WITH STAMPS,
BECAUSE OUR STRATEGY'S HONESTY,
  SO I'M GONNA GO WITH STAMPS.

           ALL RIGHT.
     AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  ALWAYS PREFERRED VACATIONING
      AT THE EIFFEL TOWER.
    - I ALSO PREFERRED--YES.

       - ARE ALL YOU GUYS
      IN COMPLETE DENIAL?
     [cheers and applause]
             - MAN.
       - OH, MY GOODNESS.

           ALL RIGHT,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
    IF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
   UPDATED THE FAMOUS SAYING
     "WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS
        STAYS IN VEGAS"

        USING THE LOCALE
OF YOUR WILDEST NIGHT TOGETHER,
           WHAT WORD
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
     WOULD REPLACE "VEGAS"?

            SHEVON?
   - WHAT HAPPENS IN JAMAICA
      STAYS IN JAMAICA...
             - OH.
          - BECAUSE...

  OUR SON WAS CONCEIVED THERE,
    AND WE HAD A GOOD TIME.
    - JERRY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     WHAT HAPPENS DOWNTOWN
        STAYS DOWNTOWN.

   - WHAT'S--WHAT'S DOWNTOWN?
        - EVERYONE KNOW
    WE HAD A KID IN JAMAICA.
     - BUT WHAT'S DOWNTOWN?
 - EVERYBODY KNOW WE HAD KIDS--

      - WE DON'T EVEN LIVE
          IN DOWNTOWN.
   - BUT WE TRAVEL DOWNTOWN!
       - WHAT'S DOWNTOWN?

        - WHAT IS THAT?
   - YOU KNOW WHAT DOWNTOWN--
          - NO, NOT--
    WELL, I KNOW NOW, BUT...
          - [laughing]

           ALL RIGHT.
     TANIA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I'M GONNA GO WITH VEGAS.
    THE--THE ORIGINAL SAYING
      MAKES SENSE FOR US.

    WE GOT MARRIED IN VEGAS.
   WE HAD AN ELVIS MINISTER.
         - WELL, BRIAN,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
 HE SAID IN MY BROTHER'S TRUCK.

           [laughter]
    - AND I TAKE IT FROM HER
 LAUGHING THAT SHE REMEMBERS--
    YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

    - THAT'S A VERY SPECIFIC
           LOCATION.
    - WHAT ABOUT YOU, JEAN?
 - WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
      SUNDERLAND, ENGLAND,

 BECAUSE WE TOOK THIS ONE TRIP,
       AND WE HAD TO STAY
 IN MY FRIEND'S MOTHER'S ROOM,
 AND I FELT VERY UNCOMFORTAE
  DOING IT ON SOMEBODY'S BED,

           SO I SAID,
   "WE'RE HITTING THE FLOOR."
            - OKAY.
      - AND THERE WAS A--
I THINK, LIKE, A FAKE POLAR BEAR
  SKIN INVOLVED OR SOMETHING.

       - ALL RIGHT, GREG,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   A FRIEND'S EX-BOYFRIEND'S
       MOTHER'S BEDROOM.
          YOU GOT IT.
          - BOOMTOWN!

            [laughs]
            - YEAH!
         - WE'RE CRAZY.

             - YES.

       <i>DOVE CHOCOLATE BAR.</i>

         - WELCOME BACK
      TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

        IT IS YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.
        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
         ARE YOU READY?

             OKAY.
       IS THE LANDSCAPING
     AROUND YOUR HUSBAND'S
    SEXUAL SUNDIAL MOST LIKE

  AN UNTAMED PERUVIAN JUNGLE,
    A GRASSY AFRICAN PLAIN,
           OR A BARE
     SAUDI ARABIAN DESERT?

             TANIA.
          - I WOULD GO
   WITH GRASSY AFRICAN PLAIN.
            - YEAH?

     - HE'S, UM, VERY NEAT
         AND WELL KEPT.
       - AND YOU'RE LIKE,
  "AND I WILL LEAVE IT THERE."
          - [chuckles]
    - JEAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - I'M ALSO GONNA HAVE TO GO
   WITH GRASSY AFRICAN PLAIN,
      ONLY BECAUSE I THINK
     WE'RE AT A GRASSY AREA
           RIGHT NOW.

           - [laughs]
      IS IT VERY SEASONAL?
  - UH, I THINK IT'S WHENEVER
         I GET THE URGE

   TO BRING OUT THE CLIPPERS.
            - OKAY.
    THAT'S A GREAT PASTIME.
           - [laughs]

           - SHEVON.
        - I WILL ALSO GO
   WITH GRASSY AFRICAN PLAIN,
 UM, BECAUSE HE'S IN THAT STAGE

          WHERE IT'S--
       IT'S GROWING BACK,
    AND SO I WILL SAY THAT.
          - ALL RIGHT.

    NEXT QUESTION, LADIES--
     WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT
      OF THE UNITED STATES
  WHEN YOUR HUSBAND WAS BORN?

             JEAN.
      - UM, HE'S ENGLISH,
      SO I DON'T EVEN KNOW
     IF HE'S GOING TO KNOW
          THIS ANSWER.

   I WOULD SAY REAGAN, 'CAUSE
  THAT'S PRETTY MUCH THE '80s.
   I'M GONNA GO WITH REAGAN.
           - SHEVON.
      - I'M GONNA ALSO GO
          WITH REAGAN,

   'CAUSE HE WAS BORN IN '81,
         AND I BELIEVE
      REAGAN WAS IN OFFICE
         AT THAT TIME.
            - TANIA?
         - OH, MY GOSH.

        CARTER? I THINK.
        - JIMMY CARTER?
           - WHO WAS
      RIGHT BEFORE REAGAN?
      - I CAN'T TELL YOU.
      - NOBODY KNOWS THAT.

       IT'S NOT JUST ME.
       NOBODY KWS THAT.
 - LOOK, EVERYBODY'S LIKE THIS.
           [laughter]

  - I'M GONNA GO WITH CARTER.
            - OKAY.
    TELL ME, WHAT'S THE MOST
 CUTESY-WOOTSY WAY YOUR HUSBAND
    LIKES TO SHOW AFFECTION?

            SHEVON.
         - UM, HE LIKES
       TO SHOW AFFECTION
            BY, UM,
      RUBBING ON MY FEET.

             - AW.
           ALL RIGHT.
             TANIA.
       - UM, THERE'S LOTS
   OF LITTLE THINGS HE DOES.

       I THINK THE CUTEST
            IS, UM,
        WHEN HE PRETENDS
        TO BE A GORILLA.
           [laughter]

AND HE PROTECTS ME FROM THE REST
  OF THE IMAGINARY PREDATORS.
             - OH.
       OH, THAT'S GREAT.
             JEAN.

      - THE--THE KISSING.
            KISSING.
     I WOULD SAY HE KISSES.
            - OKAY.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--

     IF WE EACH HAD TO PICK
     ONE PLACE IN THE WORLD
 TO LIVE THE REST OF OUR LIVES
  OTHER THAN OUR CURRENT HOME,
     I WOULD CHOOSE BLANK,

         AND MY HUSBAND
      WOULD CHOOSE BLANK.
             TANIA.
   - THIS IS SAD, B I THINK
     HE WOULD SAY IRELAND,

     BECAUSE THAT'S A PLACE
   HE'S ALWAYS WANTED TO GO,
            AND, UH,
       I WOULD SAY INDIA.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             JEAN.

   - UH, I WOULD PROBABLY SAY
           CAPE TOWN.
    I WOULD LOVE TO GO BACK
        TO WHERE WE MET.
 BUT SINCE HE MOVED FROM LONDON
          TO MARRY ME,

    I THINK HE WOULD GO BACK
          TO ENGLAND.
           - GOT IT.
            SHEVON.

 - I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY ITALY
     BECAUSE OF THE FOOD--
          I LOVE FOOD.
          AND FOR HIM,
  HE WOULD PROBABLY SAY PARIS,

         BECAUSE, UM--
  - HE LIKES THE EIFFEL TOWER.
              YES.
         - APPARENTLY.
     SO I WOULD SAY PARIS.

            - OKAY.
   THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES.

 IN THE LEAD WITH FIVE POINTS.
  NOW, COST PLUS WORLD MARKET
        HAS HOOKED US UP

         WITH A LITTLE
     INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR.
     BUT BEFORE WE GET BACK

   GREGORY AND JEAN, TELL US
ABOUT YOUR INTERNATIONAL STORY.

    YOU MET IN SOUTH AFRICA?
    - YEAH, I WENT TWO WEEKS
           BY MYSELF.
      FIRST DAY I WOKE UP,

SAW THIS DEVASTATINGLY HANDSOME
        MAN TO MY RIGHT,
    AND LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT.
  WE DATED 2 1/2 YEARS ACROSS.

        ME IN NEW YORK,
         HIM IN LONDON.
 TWO DAYS AFTER HE MOVED HERE,
        WE GOT MARRIED.
           - REALLY?
        CONGRATULATIONS.

     [cheers and applause]
           ALL RIGHT.
  HERE IS OUR FIRST QUESTION,
           GENTLEMEN.
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
        THE LANDSCAPING

   AROUND YOUR SEXUAL SUNDIAL
          IS MOST LIKE
  AN UNTAMED PERUVIAN JUNGLE,
    A GRASSY AFRICAN PLAIN,

           OR A BARE
     SAUDI ARABIAN DESERT?
             BRIAN?
           - [laughs]
 I'M GONNA SAY THE SECOND ONE--

       THE AFRICAN PLAIN.
    - TANIA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
 - I SAID GRASSY AFRICAN PLAIN.

          - OH, YEAH!
     [cheers and applause]
            - GREG.

     - I THINK I'M GONNA GO
       WITH SAME ANSWER--
     GRASSY AFRICAN PLAIN,
      ESPECIALLY IT'S BEEN
    A HARD WINTER IN AMERICA
   FOR ME, SO I'VE NEEDED A--

    NEEDED A BIT OF WARMTH.
          - [laughing]
      THANK YOU FOR THAT.
             JEAN.

     [cheers and applause]

          HUSBANDS...
   WHO DID YOUR WIFE SAY WAS
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
      WHEN YOU WERE BORN?

             GREG.

JUST FOR LACK OF KNOWLEDGE, I'M
 PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO SAY...

            CLINTON,
         BILL CLINTON.

     [cheers and applause]
       ALL RIGHT, BRIAN.

             YEAH!

         - YOU GOT IT.

     TO OUR NEXT QUESTION.
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,

             WHAT'S
   THE MOST CUTESY-WOOTSY WAY
  YOU LIKE TO SHOW AFFECTION?
             JERRY.

           - OH, MAN.
   I CAN--I CAN JUST FEEL HER
     BREATHING DOWN MY NECK
           RIGHT NOW.

           [laughter]
       ME TRYING TO BITE
          ON HER LIPS.
           - SHEVON?
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

     - RUBBING ON MY FEET.
      - YOU RUB HER FEET.
           - [scoffs]
    SO MUCH DIFFERENT WAYS.

     WE DO A LOT OF THINGS!
    - YOU FEEL HER BREATHING
     DOWN YOUR NECK STILL?
         - IT'S A HEAT.
       IT'S A HEAVY HEAT.

        - I CAN FEEL IT.
            - OKAY.
   BRIAN, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
   - UH, LIKE, BABY TALKING?

   - OH, YOU DO BABY TALKING?

    ARE YOU HIS TINY LOVEY,
             TANIA?

         [normal voice]
  YOU PRETEND TO BE A GORILLA.
     - I WAS GOING TO SAY--
          OH, MY GOD.
          - SHOW 'EM.

    [laughter and applause]
     - OH, THAT WAS GREAT.
     GREG, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - I THINK THE BEST ANSWER
       WOULD BE PROBABLY
     PLAYING WITH HER FEET.
   - WHAT DID YOU SAY, JEAN?

       - I SAID KISSING!
           - [groans]
        - OH, I'M SORRY.
OKAY, LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.

    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.

  THIS CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.
         ARE YOU READY?
          HERE WE GO.
  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

     IF WE EACH HAD TO PICK
     ONE PLACE IN THE WORLD
 TO LIVE THE REST OF OUR LIVES
  OTHER THAN OUR CURRENT HOME,

     I WOULD CHOOSE BLANK,
         AND MY HUSBAND
      WOULD CHOOSE BLANK.
             GREG.

   - OH, THIS IS A HARD ONE.
  UM, BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE
 THE SAME PLACE FOR BOTH OF US.
 IT WOULD BE, UH, STELLENBOSCH
        IN SOUTH AFRICA.

   - WHAT DID YOU SAY, JEAN?
   - I SAID YOU WOULD GO BACK
     TO YOUR HOME, ENGLAND.

 AND I WOULD SAY IN CAPE TOWN.
    - SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT,
         IN CAPE TOWN.
      YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.

        - SOUTH AFRICA.
            - OKAY.
        - YEAH, ALMOST.
           [applause]

        AND, UM, FOR ME,
    I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO--
     I HAVE NO ROOTS THERE
          OR ANYTHING,
  BUT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO
          TO IRELAND.

           - TANIA--
   - WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
           - WHAT...
           OH, YEAH!

           [applause]
          - SURPRISE!
     [cheers and applause]

           ALL RIGHT.
  JERRY, YOU HAVE TO GET BOTH
         RIGHT TO TIE.
        - OH, WOW. UM...

   WELL, DUE TO THE FACT THAT
 SHE LOVES TO EAT ITALIAN FOOD,
      I HAVE TO SAY ITALY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
      - AND, UM, MYSELF...

    I'LL SAY PARIS, FRANCE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    SHEVON, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     YEAH, ITALY AND PARIS!

     [cheers and applause]
           LET'S SEE,
      SO COUPLE NUMBER ONE
    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE
           ARE TIED,

   WHICH MEANS WE HAVE TO GO
        TO A TIEBREAKER.
        BEFORE THE SHOW,
      WE ASKED EACH COUPLE
        TO PREDICT WHAT
  THEIR FINAL SCORE WOULD BE.

  THE COUPLE WHOSE PREDICTION
         COMES CLOSEST
       WITHOUT GOING OVER
      WILL BE THE WINNER.
      SO, BRIAN AND TANIA,
     WHAT DO YOU GUYS HAVE?

           30 POINTS.
           ALL RIGHT.
       JERRY AND SHEVON,
           40 POINTS.

        CONGRATULATIONS,
       JERRY AND SHEVON.
      YOU'RE THE WINNERS.
YOU'RE GOING ON A CARAVAN TOUR.
BUT EVERYBODY'S A WINNER TODAY,
