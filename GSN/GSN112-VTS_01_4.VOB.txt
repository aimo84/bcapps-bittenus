           <i>Dick Clark!</i>

      [audience cheering]
   Thank you very, very much.
   Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.

      This is a Wednesday,
       as you well know,
            and it's
      The $25,000 Pyramid.
          And we gave
   some money away yesterday,

      we'll probably give
     some more away today.
 And you won't get any of it,
but you get the thrill
of excitement of playing along

 with Audrey Landers.
How are you?
       I'm feeling good.
You two coordinated
your wardrobe

before you came in today?
         That's right.
         Let's find out
         your partner's name.
Pat Cornog, is it?
                           Yes.

What do you do, Pat?
 I sell residential real estate
           in West Los Angeles.
 Are you good at this game?
     I'm wonderful at this game.

                        I hope.
We'll be the judge of that.
      Pat, we'll see how--
      Audrey, how did you
   first learned this thing?

         You watched it
         on television?
      I have to tell you,
 when I was doing a soap opera
          in New York,

         I was about 12
        or 14 years old,
       and everyone used
         to watch this
         before we went
   to the taping of the show.

You're 12 or--
    I think it's so crazy,
     I couldn't watch it.
   But I keep looking at it--
You hear that Brian?
She was 12 or 14 years old

when she first started
the Pyramid.
          Yeah, yeah.
      Now, you've grown up
         a little bit.
 Brian, how are you, sir?

           I'm fine.
         How are you?
Very well.
Your partner has done
quite well here.
Margaret Smith, who's--

What is it?
what do we call you,
A marketing consultant?
       Uh, Director of Marketing
     for a Psychiatric hospital.
Alright. That's it.
Better to clarify.

         How much money
     did you win yesterday?
                        $16,100.
That's right.

Brian, you got to give her
more of our money away.
          Absolutely.
We will take you over
to that Winner's Circle

    and see that it's done.
Either Pat or Margaret will win
     some today, for sure.
     These are the subjects
        on a Wednesday:

Uh-hmm.

Okay, and you sleep
with it at night.
It's a cute little thing.
                  A teddy bear.
Uh-hmm.
              A stuffed animal.

           Okay, and it's a kind

         Tropical fish.

        Would they razzed that,
                      I wonder?
I don't know.
Is that alright judge,
armored soldier?
Yeah, they are armored.
                       Armored.

         They're armed, I guess,
         is a better word,
 but armored is really.
                  Oh, so close.
            Really.

 Hey, $750.
That's about a good
as you can get
and it's a tough
score to beat.

So that's the way
the game will play.
And in the next round,
we'll see if that holds,
maybe you'll be back here.
             Okay.

             We'll find out
             in a second.
                            Ah!
           Thank you.
  I was going to say armored but
 I was afraid of getting razzed.

         Oh, I know.
          But I was thinking...
You know, I get panicked
at the end.
You really don't think.
                          Yeah.

       But I was thinking
      of fish in the sea.
      I wasn't picturing.

            You're watching
            The $25,000 Pyramid,
          Wednesday edition here
          on CBS.

             Audrey and Margaret
             are partnered now.
      Margaret has just won $750
      which makes it
           a tough score to beat
           as we discussed.

      And Audrey will be
      in a day or two off on a--
           Not a pleasure joint,
           you're going work.
         That's right.
Where are you going to work?

I'm going to be working
in Vienna and Berlin
shooting a movie there.
About?
        About the life
      of Johann Strauss.

And as we clarified
on Monday,
      you are not playing
          Mr. Strauss,
       but one of his--
            One of his three...

        How many wives?
            He had three wives.
I played the second one
who is much younger than he was.
What happened to you
along the way?

Or do we have to see
the movie to find out
      or read a good book?
        We were actually granted
                      a divorce.

    I was so rotten to him.
Really?
    Yes. Back in those days.
Back in those days.
            Uh-hmm.

      Uh, what's the name
          of the film?
       "The Waltz King."
Alright, we'll look for it.
When?
Sometime next year?
            Uh-hmm.

 Good luck with that.
Brian Mitchell,
Jackpot on "Trapper John,"
CBS, what night of the week?

           Right now
      on Thursday nights.
At?
         Eight o'clock.
 Well, thank you sir.

Pat, you're up on deck
and these are your subjects.
        You're gonna do
   a little catching up here.

     We have the Mystery 7.

   You will want to win this
definitely because if you do so,
 I personally will drive it up
         to your house.
   I'll sit in the front seat
      and bring it to you.

       Guess what it is?
                  I really need
             one of those, too.
A tractor you need?
                     A tractor.
             [audience laughing]

            That will be great.
    Uh, it's an automobile,
          of course.
          What would you like?
             What do you think?
           Let's try
      Just Lying Around.

                          Okay.
Just Lying Around, alright.
Describe these things

Very nicely done.
           Good job.
                      Thank you.

       Puts the pressure
       on the other team.
     When you get 7 points,
        they got to work
        a little harder.
        Not that they're
       not working hard.

Audrey?
          Winging It.
          Winging It
          is the choice.

                             Oh.

         What was the other one?
7-5, the score.
The advantage is Pat's.
     Still looking for that
    Mystery 7 in there, Pat.

Where do you think it is?
                      We'll try
              It's Such a Drag.
   Alright, these are things
   associated with an auto race.
 Things associated

                          Okay.

                  You wave this.
Flag.
                         Right.

           And your tire goes...
Flat.
            And when someone has
    an accident, this vehicle...

Crash.
                      Comes up.
Emergency.
Ambulance.
                         Right.
           And you wear this
           to protect your head.

Helmet.
        And the person who works
        on the car is the...
Pit crew.
The engineer.

Mechanic.
      Like, you take your car--
                         Right.
       And how fast you're going
                       is the...
Speed limit.

   And you sit in these benches.
Uh, bleachers.
                         Right.
(Dick) You can't get
anymore than that.

Hanging on
to a perfect score.
14-5.

    Um, a blank cheese sandwich.
A Swiss--
Grilled cheese.
                          Okay.

           Um, this is where you
                  set a mouse...
Trap.
      Um, this is melted cheese,
      you stick a...

A grill.
A griddle.
No, it's Swiss and it's melted.
Fondue.
                          Okay.
   And this is cheese and blank,
   a type of elbow...

Macaroni.
        [buzzer sounds]
                         Right.
(Dick)
Alrighty.
     [audience applauding]

We have sort of
a tight game here.
         12-14, 14-12.

Now, the good part, Margaret,
about trailing is
you have the choice first.
                        Uh-hmm.
     You have a 50-50 shot
       of finding a card

      that says Mystery 7,
      then it's up to you
        to win the car.
Where is the Mystery 7?

                   Inside Moves.
                             Ah!
     [audience applauding]

   Now comes the hard part.
                         Right.
             Do you want to give
             or receive?
                   I will give.
Alright.

Uh, I always gave away to you.
 I need your 30 seconds here.
30 seconds
and a score of 19 on the board

will win you a car.
 Ready, go.
            Okay, you shoot this
                   from the gun.

Bullet.
                         Right.
Okay, and I spill coffee on my--
I have now a...
Shirt.
          I cannot get it out--

Stain, stain.
                         Right.
    Okay, and she comes out
    of the bottle, I dream of...
Genie.
                          Okay.

   And a wolf has these large...
Fangs.
                         Right.
           Okay, and I have, um,

            I have my blank out,
                      it bursts.
Your appendix.
                         Right.
     Okay, and this is a little,
     like a slug

      with his house on the top.
A snail.
                         Right.
          Okay, and this flower,
       it's a bud and then it...

Rose. Bloom.
Blossom.
                         Right.
(Dick)
That's got it!
 Congratulations.

     [audience applauding]
     It was the all things
         that come out.
       A bullet, a stain,
        a genie, fangs,

           appendix,
       snail and blossom.
      Things that come out.
      And, Johnny Gilbert,

         Now, let's see
    how the game continues.

           It's 19-14
Pat, that's disappointing
you didn't win a car,
but you maybe can win the chance
to go to the Winner's Circle

Would you like to give
or receive?
                  I'll receive.
You need 20 points.
           Uh, Brian,
     describe these people

       who have appeared
     in "People Magazine."
             Okay.
People who have appeared
in "People Magazine."
            Uh-hmm.
Ready, go.

Uh, she's a singer
with a...
                  Dolly Parton.
Uh-hmm.
Uh, he's a talk show host

and he's always going out
interviewing people.
                  Johnny Carson.
               Uh, Phil Donahue.
Um, she's on "Dynasty."
She's very--

                  Joan Collins.

(Dick)
That's it!

                          Yeah!
           Let's go.
We're off to the Winner's Circle
to go for $10,000.
      [audience cheering]

Oh.
      What a good timing.
So you didn't win a car.
     I would love $1,100.
Okay, here we go again.

This is the last one
for the day.
You have a chance
to win $10,000.
You do want to keep in mind
that your opponent has won $750.

That's what we call
the score money.
The bonus money
is just money.
          Still money.
Nice money.

It doesn't count
on the scoreboard.
So in order to return,
it must be a tie at $750.
Obviously, if you win more
or go to 10,000,

no tie, you'll be back
to try again, okay?
             Okay.
             For $10,000,
     here is your first subject.

             Go!
               Uh, Miss America.
                 Miss Universe.
Beauty Pageant.

     [audience applauding]
             We went up the hill
       to fetch a pail of water.
What Jack and Jill
would say.

     [audience applauding]
         Uh, the hors d'oeuvres.
                 The appetizer.
Things before dinner.

Things on the menu.
     [audience applauding]
                Uh, Billy Bardy.

Clown. Short people.
Midget.
     [audience applauding]
              Uh, your marriage.

                 Your Christmas.
Things you celebrate.
                 Your marriage.
Things you have a ceremony for.

Things you--
                      The birth
           of your first child.
         Things that excite you.
         Things you like.
                       The birth
            of your first child.

Things that make you happy.
     [audience applauding]
            Um, your shiny nose.

Things you powder.
                    You got it!
      [audience cheering]
There you go.

 Congratulations.
 That's a perfect word.
Pull up a chair
and rest yourself.

That was a challenge.
              Oh.
      To match $750 is,
      you know, that's not easy.
How are you?
      I'm not in reality.

              I--
No--
    You're gonna wake me up
       and it's tomorrow
   and still on the show.
You had 13 seconds left
on the clock.

What's that 47 seconds?
      Whoo! That's great.
Pretty good.
        But what's that?
Was that things make you happy?
I don't even know what that was.

Joy or happy
were the key words they wanted.
A joyful event.
A happy event or whatever.
Things that make you happy.

                But you got it.
So far--
You're not too worried
about the car now?
  No, maybe I'll buy one now.
Yeah, good.

Alright, we'll be back
to wrap it up in a second.
Don't go away.
       Oh, that's great.
                      Terrific.
      Thank you so much.

               Congratulations.
            Oh, yes.
      [indistinct chatter]
     Great, thanks so much.

   Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.

     Audrey, we'll meet you
        again tomorrow.
          Absolutely.
Are you ready to go after him
tomorrow with a vengeance?

   Well, he's tough but, uh--
Be careful, Brian.
We have to say good-bye
to Margaret,
 but it's not all that bad.

You can drive away
in your car.
You know it's not here,
I was only kidding.
                That's alright.
    Is it alright if I don't
    drive it over to your house?

                   That's fine.
You get that
along with $16,850
and our hearty
congratulations.
           Thank you very much.
          Brian, we will
          see you tomorrow, sir.

         I'll be here.
At the appointed hour.
Pat, you have won $11,100.
The 10,000 was won
in 47 seconds.
                  That's great.

      Let's see if you can do it
      again tomorrow.
                          Okay.
We'll see you right here.
    For now, I'm Dick Clark.
            So long.
