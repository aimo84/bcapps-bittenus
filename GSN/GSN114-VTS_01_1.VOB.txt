HEY, THE SINNOTT FAMILY
GOT 130. THE ASHLEYS
NOT ON THE BOARD YET.

DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, THOUGH.
THE GOAL IS 300 POINTS.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

 COPD makes it hard to breathe,
    so I wasn't playing much
    of a role in my own life,
        but with ADVAIR,
      I'm breathing better

   so now I can take the lead
     on a science adventure.
   ADVAIR is clinically proven
      to help significantly
     improve lung function.

  Unlike most COPD medications,
      ADVAIR contains both
   an anti-inflammatory and a
   long-acting bronchodilator,
working together to help improve
   your lung function all day.

ADVAIR won't replace fast-acting
  inhalers for sudden symptoms
        and should not be
   used more than twice a day.
People with COPD taking
ADVAIR may have

  a higher chance of pneumonia.
    ADVAIR may increase your
      risk of osteoporosis
     and some eye problems.

     Tell your doctor if you
     have a heart condition
     or high blood pressure
      before taking ADVAIR.

     If you're still having
      difficulty breathing,
         take the lead.
       Ask your doctor if
        including ADVAIR

       could help improve
       your lung function.
