             - HI.
             HELLO!

          AND WELCOME
      TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
   NOW, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED
        THAT THINGS LOOK
  A LITTLE DIFFERENT TONIGHT.

    ALL THIS WEEK, THE FOLKS
   AT COST PLUS WORLD MARKET
        ARE ADDING SOME
INTERNATIONAL FLARE TO OUR SHOW,
     INCLUDING MY JEWELRY.

         THEIR PRODUCTS
     ARE UNIQUE, AUTHENTIC,
    AND ALWAYS AFFORDABLE--
   PERFECT FOR OUR NEWLYWEDS

         AS THEY START
   THEIR NEW LIVES TOGETHER.
          SO, FELLAS,
      WELCOME TO OUR SHOW.
        ARE YOU READY TO
         JUST DO THIS?

            - YEAH.
         - ABSOLUTELY.
            - OKAY.
    WELL, LET'S GET STARTED.
           GENTLEMEN,
  ARE YOUR WIFE'S TRAVEL BAGS

      SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT
        UNDER THE SEAT,
    BIG ENOUGH TO BE CHECKED
          AT THE GATE,
      OR SO HUGE THAT THEY
    REQUIRE GROUND SHIPPING?

             JEFF.
    - I'M GONNA GO WITH THEY
NEED TO GET CHECKED AT THE GATE,
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY'RE JUST,
     YOU KNOW, PERFECT SIZE

    THAT YOU WANNA TAKE THEM
 WITH YOU ALL THE TIME, BUT...
           - UH-HUH.
   - YOU DON'T WANT EVERYBODY
  WATCHING YOU WHEN YOU DO IT.
         - OKAY. JODIE.

     - CHECKED AT THE GATE.
     - CHECKED AT THE GATE?
       - YEAH, DEFINITELY
   CHECKED AT THE GATE, YEP.
   - MARLON, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - UNDER THE SEAT. SHE'S READY
   TO GO--YEAH, SHE'S QUICK.
 SHE GETS EVERYTHING TOGETHER.
            - OKAY.
      - EVERYTHING PACKED,
     EVERYTHING ORGANIZED.

          - GENTLEMEN,
      OUR NEXT QUESTION--
     MANY LITTLE GIRLS LIKE
    TO DRESS UP THEIR DOLLS
    WHEN THEY'RE GROWING UP,
  BUT NOW IT'S YOUR TURN, MEN.

     IF, FOR YOUR PLEASURE,
     YOU COULD ADD ONE ITEM
    TO YOUR WIFE'S WARDROBE,
     WHAT WOULD YOU CHOOSE?
             JODIE.

      - I WOULD DEFINITELY
     CHOOSE STRIPPER HEELS.
   - OH, SOME STRIPPER HEELS?
          - YEAH, SOME
      MORE STRIPPER HEELS.

  - SOME MORE STRIPPER HEELS?
    - YEAH, YEAH, SOME MORE.
      - YOU CAN NEVER GET
     ENOUGH STRIPPER HEELS.
    - NO, YOU NEVER CAN, NO.

     - BOY, THAT'S PUTTIN'
     A SMILE ON YOUR FACE.
      - YEAH, YOU KNOW IT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    MARLON, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

           - PROBABLY
      A FISHNET BODYSUIT.
     - A FISHNET BODYSUIT?
              OH!

  YOU HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS.
          - [chuckles]
  - I CAN SEE IT IN YOUR HEAD.

    - JEFF, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - SHERRI, I'D HAVE TO SAY
  SOME REALLY SLUTTY LINGERIE.
 - LIKE WHAT KIND OF LINGERIE?

    - SOMETHING THAT, LIKE,
         EXUDES SEX...
            - OKAY.
     - WHEN SHE PUTS IT ON.
          - ALL RIGHT.

       HUSBANDS, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
         WHICH OF YOUR
     WIFE'S ACCOMPLISHMENTS
     IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS
  SHOULD GET HER ON THE COVER

         OF <i>TIME</i> MAGAZINE
     AS WOMAN OF THE YEAR?
            MARLON.
        - BEING MY WIFE.

            - OKAY.
    - SHE DOES A GREAT JOB.
     - SHE DOES A GREAT JOB
        BEING YOUR WIFE?
            - YEAH.
            - JEFF.

  - YEAH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
     WITH THAT SAME ANSWER.
     YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK
      THAT SHE, YOU KNOW,
         DEALS WITH ME
       ON A DAILY BASIS,

     AND THAT'S HARD ENOUGH
          FOR ANYBODY.
        SO SHE DESERVES
     MANY AWARDS FOR THAT.
        - OKAY, WILL DO.
             JODIE.

   - I'D HATE TO FOLLOW SUIT,
  BUT I'D SAY THE SAME THING.
    SHE'S AN AMAZING WOMAN.
           SHE DOES--
     SHE JUGGLES EVERYTHING
     ALL THE TIME IT SEEMS.

 AND IN THE COURSE OF ALL THAT,
      MARRIED ME AS WELL.
    SO I THINK I WOULD HAVE
          TO SAY THAT.
      - ALL RIGHT, WHAT--
   YOU GUYS ARE SO WONDERFUL.

       NICE JOB, FELLAS.
     NOW, I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,
       BECAUSE THE COUPLE
      WITH THE MOST POINTS

     AT THE END OF THE GAME
      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
 SECOND HONEYMOON TO ST. CROIX.
         CHECK IT OUT!

           ALL RIGHT!
      OUR WIVES ARE BACK.
          NOW, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS.
  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.

         SO HERE WE GO.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
        DID YOUR HUSBAND
    SAY YOUR TRAVEL BAGS ARE

      SMALL ENOUGH TO FIT
        UNDER THE SEAT,
    BIG ENOUGH TO BE CHECKED
          AT THE GATE,
      OR SO HUGE THAT THEY
    REQUIRE GROUND SHIPPING?

             ANNA.
        - I'M GONNA SAY
    BIG ENOUGH TO BE CHECKED
          AT THE GATE.
 - YEAH, ANY PARTICULAR REASON?

    - I HOPE THEY'RE ENOUGH
         TO GRAB ONTO.
        - AH. JEFF, ARE
   THEY ENOUGH TO GRAB ONTO?
     - ABSOLUTELY, SHERRI.
   - BIG ENOUGH TO BE CHECKED

          AT THE GATE!
            - WHOO!
        GOOD JOB, HONEY.
            [laughs]
     - ALL RIGHT, KENYALA,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

         - I'M GONNA GO
     WITH THE SAME THING--
    BIG ENOUGH TO BE CHECKED
         AT THE GATE...
            - YEAH?
   - BECAUSE I'M--SAME THING.

         I'M NOT SMALL,
    BUT I'M NOT HUGE, SO...
            - OKAY.
 - THINK THEY'RE NICE, THOUGH.
    - JODIE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
           - PERFECT.

   - BIG ENOUGH TO BE CHECKED
          AT THE GATE.
           - [laughs]
      - ALL RIGHT, TAMARA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

 - I THINK BIG ENOUGH TO CHECK
          AT THE GATE.
       I'M NOT TOO SMALL,
         NOT TOO LARGE.
      - ALL RIGHT, MARLON.

          SMALL ENOUGH
     TO FIT UNDER THE SEAT.
             - AH.
           - [laughs]
         - MARLON, DID
     YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT--

   - I ANSWERED THAT QUESTION
       TOTALLY INCORRECT.
   I WASN'T THINKING AT ALL.
            - YEAH.
      - WERE YOU ACTUALLY
       THINKING LUGGAGE?

      - YEAH, I'M THINKING
         ABOUT LUGGAGE.
  - AND YOU KNOW WHAT, SHERRI?
    I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT,
     BECAUSE I'M THINKING,
    "HE'S THINKING LUGGAGE."

          - [laughing]
    - HE'S THINKING LUGGAGE.
          - HUSBANDS,
        NEXT QUESTION--
  MANY GIRLS LIKE TO DRESS UP
          THEIR DOLLS

    WHEN THEY'RE GROWING UP.
          BUT NOW IT'S
  YOUR HUSBAND'S TURN, LADIES.
     IF, FOR HIS PLEASURE,

     HE COULD ADD ONE ITEM
       TO YOUR WARDROBE,
       WHAT DO YOU THINK
      HE SAID HE'D CHOOSE?
            KENYALA.

           - [sighs]
   I'M GONNA GO WITH NOTHING,
  'CAUSE, GIRL, I GOT IT ALL.
             - OH!
          I LIKE THAT!

          - [laughing]
          - I LOVE IT.
  JODIE, DOES SHE HAVE IT ALL?
    - SHE DOES HAVE IT ALL.
         - BUT HE WOULD
   LOVE SOME STRIPPER HEELS.

             - AH!
         - SORRY, BABY.
         - THAT'S OKAY.
          - [chuckles]
      - ALL RIGHT, TAMARA,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

         - HE LIKES ME
     IN TIGHTS OR LEGGINGS,
         SO I WOULD SAY
    ANOTHER PAIR OF TIGHTS.
   - ANOTHER PAIR OF TIGHTS.

             OKAY.
    MARLON, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       FISHNET BODYSUIT.
         - BABE, WHAT?

           [laughter]
    - WELL, SHE HAS FISHNET
   BODYSUITS ALREADY, THOUGH.
            - YEAH.
    - I WANTED MORE, THOUGH.

          - OH, GOSH.
           [laughter]
            - OKAY.
     ANNA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I'M KIND OF TORN,
        BUT I'M THINKING

        THAT HE WANTS ME
      TO JUST WEAR THINGS
     THAT ARE JUST KIND OF
        MORE REVEALING.
 LIKE, SHIRTS THAT KIND OF SHOW
OFF MY CHEST A LITTLE BIT MORE,

 JUST LIKE KIND OF PUSH THEM UP
 TO SHOW THEM OFF A LITTLE BIT.
   - JEFF, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I SAID LINGERIE.
    - HE SAID SEXY LINGERIE.

   - THAT WAS THE OTHER ONE.
           - COME ON!
          - I'M SORRY!
 I WAS THINKING THAT AT FIRST,
        BUT THEN LATELY
     YOU'VE JUST BEEN LIKE,

       "YOU NEED TO SHOW
       YOUR BOOBS MORE."
           - YOU DO!
       IN SEXY LINGERIE.
          - ALL RIGHT.

        LADIES, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
 WHICH OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS
     IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
  SHOULD GET YOU ON THE COVER

         OF <i>TIME</i> MAGAZINE
     AS WOMAN OF THE YEAR?
            TAMARA.
        - I'M A TEACHER,
   SO HE WOULD SAY SOMETHING
    THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ME

    SPENDING TIME IN SCHOOL.
        - OKAY, MARLON.
    HE SAID BEING HIS WIFE.
            - BABE.
             WHAT?

            CLEARLY,
    WE DIDN'T COME TOGETHER.
           [laughter]
            - OKAY.
     ANNA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - MY GUESS IS JUST PROBABLY
    SOMETHING WORK-RELATED.
    HE JUST KNOWS I'VE BEEN
  WORKING AN AWFUL LOT LATELY.
   AND JUST REALLY, YOU KNOW?

  OR, THOUGH, I COULD HEAR HIM
 SAYING, LIKE, "BEING MY WIFE."
      - BUT YOU SAY WORK?
    - BUT I'M GONNA GO WORK.
            - OKAY.
WELL, JEFF, IS IT WORK RELATED?

             - NO!
         BEING MY WIFE!
    [laughter and applause]
            COME ON!

           - KENYALA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - I'M GONNA GO WITH WORK, TOO,
      BECAUSE I JUST WORK
         ALL THE TIME.

      I WORK REALLY HARD.
I JUST STARTED A NEW JOB, SO...
         YEAH, AND HE'S
  REALLY PROUD OF ME FOR THAT.
     - OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.
   JODIE, YOU SO PROUD OF HER

     ABOUT BEING AT WORK--
        BEING HIS WIFE!
    [laughter and applause]
         OH, I LOVE IT.
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.

JEFF AND ANNA, YOU GUYS ARE TIED
     WITH JODIE AND KENYALA
       FOR FIRST PLACE--
   YOU GUYS GOT FIVE POINTS.
     BUT WHEN WE COME BACK,

     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,
         AND THIS TIME
    THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED.
         SO STAY TUNED.

   [ Mom ] TO ME, CHEX IS NOT
  JUST A LITTLE BOWL OF CEREAL,
    IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL.
      CHEX HAS FIVE FLAVORS
      THAT ARE GLUTEN-FREE.

       EVEN A CINNAMON ONE
         THE KIDS LOVE.
  THE WORD "WOW" COMES TO MIND.
 <i>[ Male Announcer ] CHEX CEREAL.</i>

          <i>FIVE FLAVORS.</i>
      <i>GOOD AND GLUTEN FREE.</i>
              â™ª

         BREAK THE ICE
     WITH BREATH-FRESHENING
     COOLING CRYSTALS.
         ICE BREAKERS.

 LOOK WHO WE GOT HERE.
  PUT A LITTLE PEPPER ON THAT.
       I'M A TYPICAL MOM.

    I GO TO AMUSEMENT PARKS.
      AND MY KID'S GAMES.
 AND JUST LIKE ANY TYPICAL MOM

 I'M THRILLED WHEN MY CHAMPION
     LOVES TO EAT SOMETHING
     NUTRITIOUS,
 LIKE CHOBANI CHAMPIONS YOGURT.

 IT'S A GOOD SOURCE OF PROTEIN,
AND MOST IMPORTANT, HE LOVES IT.
     SO EVEN THOUGH I'M AN
     OLYMPIAN, AROUND HERE,

 I'M JUST ANOTHER MOM TRYING TO
 HELP HER CHAMPION WIN THE DAY.
       CHOBANI CHAMPIONS.
       WIN THE DAY.
         - WELCOME BACK
      TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
   IT IS YOUR TURN TO ANSWER
        A FEW QUESTIONS.
        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.

     ARE YOU READY, LADIES?
             - YES.
      - OKAY, HERE WE GO.
 IF YOU COULD CHANGE ONE THING

 ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND'S PROPOSAL,
       WHAT WOULD IT BE--
      MORE OF A SURPRISE,
         MORE ROMANTIC,
      OR A DIFFERENT RING?

             ANNA.
        - MORE ROMANTIC,
      BECAUSE HE HAD THIS
  BIG, HUGE THING PLANNED OUT,

 AND THERE WAS A THUNDERSTORM,
   AND THERE WERE, YOU KNOW--
    ONE OF OUR FRIENDS GOT,
     LIKE, THE CHICKEN POX.
           - OH, NO!

      - SO HIS WHOLE PLAN,
         LIKE, FOLDED.
         AND SO HE JUST
    KIND OF JUST WINGED IT.
   SO I'M HOPING THAT THAT'S
    WHAT HE'S GONNA GO WITH.

            - OKAY.
    KENYALA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - WELL, I PICKED OUT THE RING,
       SO IT'S NOT THAT.
   AND IT WAS VERY ROMANTIC.

  AND IT WAS A SURPRISE, TOO.
 HE FLEW ME UP IN A HELICOPTER
       AND EVERYTHING...
             - OH!
        - OVER THE LAKE.

       IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
             - WOW.
    - BUT I'LL SAY ROMANTIC,
       BECAUSE JODIE WAS
      A HELICOPTER PILOT,

    BUT HE DIDN'T GET TO FLY
           THE PLANE.
    SOMEONE ELSE HAD TO FLY.
     SO IF HE WOULD'VE FLEW
           THE PLANE,

 IT WOULD'VE BEEN EVEN BETTER.
          - OH, OKAY.
  - SO I'LL SAY MORE ROMANTIC.
           - GOT YOU.
    TAMARA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

           - SHERRI,
      THIS IS A TOUGH ONE.
       IT WAS DEFINITELY
          A SURPRISE.
     IT WAS VERY ROMANTIC.

      AND I LOVE MY RING,
'CAUSE I PICKED IT OUT AS WELL.
   SO I'M JUST GONNA GO ALONG
      WITH MORE ROMANTIC.
    - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
    NEXT QUESTION, LADIES--

        HOW MANY STUNTS
       CAN YOUR HUSBAND'S
     LITTLE JACKIE CHAN...
           [laughter]

     PULL OFF IN ONE NIGHT?
            KENYALA.
          - [laughing]

         THIS IS CRAZY.
 HE'S DEFINITELY GOOD FOR TWO.
             YEAH.

       I WANNA SAY THREE,
 BUT I'M GONNA STICK WITH TWO.
    - YOU'RE GONNA SAY TWO?
            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.
            TAMARA.

     - I'M GONNA SAY THREE.
            - THREE?
             ANNA.
        - I'M DEFINITELY
         SAYING THREE.

     AND MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S
     IN THE AUDIENCE, SO...
             - OH!
 - BUT I'M STILL SAYING THREE.
- MOM-IN-LAW'S IN THE AUDIENCE.
         - YES, SHE IS.

         - LOOK AT HER.
  WHAT'S THE LOOK ON HER FACE?
 - SHE'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSED.
           [laughter]
- BUT SHE SHOULD BE PROUD, TOO.

             YEAH?
        - SHE SHOULD BE!
     SHE RAISED A GOOD BOY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.

    IF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
WERE TO START YOUR OWN COUNTRY,
  WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST LAW
  ENFORCED IN YOUR NEW NATION?
            TAMARA.

  - ALWAYS TREAT ANIMALS WELL.
   HE'S REALLY INTO ANIMALS.
  HE DOESN'T LIKE WHEN PEOPLE
      ARE ABUSING ANIMALS.

     SO I'LL GO WITH THAT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             ANNA.
 - I HAVE NO CLUE ON THIS ONE.

      SO I'M JUST GONNA GO
     WITH SOMETHING FUNNY,
        BECAUSE WE WATCH
        A LOT OF <i>FRIENDS.</i>
        SO I'M GONNA SAY
         NAKED MONDAYS.

  - NAKED MONDAYS, ALL RIGHT.
            KENYALA.
          - WE'RE BOTH
   VERY COMPASSIONATE PEOPLE,
SO WE DO NOT LIKE TO SEE PEOPLE
  BEING MEAN TO OTHER PEOPLE.

     SO I'M JUST GONNA SAY
          BEING SWEET.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
            COMPLETE
     THIS SENTENCE, LADIES.

   IF I COULD MAKE LOVE TO MY
 HUSBAND ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,
     IT WOULD BE IN BLANK.
      AND MY HUSBAND WOULD
   WANT US TO DO IT IN BLANK.

             ANNA.
           - FOR ME,
       I'D WANT IT TO BE,
         LIKE, AT A BAR
         OR RESTAURANT.

          - [laughing]
            - YEAH.
AND FOR HIM, HE'D WANT IT TO BE,
      LIKE, AT A STADIUM,
   LIKE, AT A SPORTING EVENT.

             - WOW.
             - YEP.
           - YOU GUYS
 ARE REALLY PUBLIC PEOPLE, HUH?
      - APPARENTLY, YEAH.
            - OKAY.

         AND THEN WHAT
      ABOUT YOU, KENYALA?
         - FOR ME, IT'S
     DEFINITELY BORA BORA,
       'CAUSE I'VE ALWAYS
      WANTED TO GO THERE.

      AND FOR HIM, I MEAN,
 I THINK MAYBE BORA BORA, TOO,
        BECAUSE HE KNOWS
       I WANNA GO THERE,
      SO HE WOULD WANNA DO
    WHATEVER I WANTED TO DO.

            - OKAY.
           - [laughs]
   - TAMARA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I WOULD PROBABLY SAY
     ON THE BEACH, SUNSET.

        AND HE PROBABLY
    WILL SAY THE SAME THING.
   WE LOVE THE BEACH, SUNSET.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            - YEAH.

      - THANK YOU SO MUCH,
            LADIES.
      NOW, WHEN WE RETURN,
        WE'RE GONNA SEE
       IF THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

    NOW, IF WE CAN JUST GET
   THE GUYS TO STOP THINKING
   ABOUT THEIR WIVES' GLOBES
         FOR A SECOND,

  WE'LL GET BACK TO THE GAME.
       ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
       HERE IS THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.

    GENTLEMEN, IF YOUR WIFE
     COULD CHANGE ONE THING
      ABOUT YOUR PROPOSAL,
 WHAT DID SHE SAY IT WOULD BE--
         MORE ROMANTIC,
      MORE OF A SURPRISE,

      OR A DIFFERENT RING?
             JEFF.
       - WELL, I KNOW SHE
    ABSOLUTELY WOULD NOT SAY
       A DIFFERENT RING.

     - SHE LOVED HER RING?
          - SHE ABSO--
  SHE DIDN'T ACTUALLY SAY YES
        TO THE PROPOSAL.
    SHE ACTUALLY JUST STARED
          AT THE RING.

             - AW!
 - SO I HAD TO, LIKE, ASK HER,
    YOU KNOW, CAN YOU PLEASE
          LET ME KNOW?
            - YEAH.
   - NO, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO

    WITH MORE OF A SURPRISE.
   - WHAT DID YOU SAY, ANNA?
    - I SAID MORE ROMANTIC.
        - MORE ROMANTIC.

            - WHAT?
   - YOU HAD THE WHOLE THING
          PLANNED OUT,
         AND EVERYTHING
    JUST KEPT FALLING APART,

         SO I FELT BAD!
       - THAT'S ROMANCE.
      - WELL, BUT YOU HAD
         A WHOLE THING.
         THAT'S WHY...
          - PSH! PSH!

             - AW!
     - I'M GONNA SMACK YOU!
      MY ANSWER WAS RIGHT.
        YOURS WAS WRONG.
  - YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RING,
  HOW MUCH YOU LOVE YOUR RING.

     CAN WE SEE YOUR RING?
    OH, THAT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.
             IT IS.
             - YES.

       - IT'S ALL BLING.
        IT'S LIKE, WHOA!
          - [chuckles]
  - VERY NICE, VERY BEAUTIFUL.
    - I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT.

            - OKAY.
     JODIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - WELL, I DON'T THINK
  YOU COULD GET MORE ROMANTIC
       THAN WHAT WE DID,
 WHICH WAS THE HELICOPTER RIDE,

     SUNSET OVER THE LAKE.
             - OH!
   - IT WAS VERY, VERY COOL.
          - ALL RIGHT.
         - AND I THINK
    SHE PICKED OUT THE RING,

         SO I WOULD SAY
      MORE OF A SURPRISE.
     - MORE OF A SURPRISE.
   KENYALA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        - MORE ROMANTIC.

         - JUST BECAUSE
       DANNY WAS WITH US.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
          THAT'S TRUE.
   - MARLON, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
    I DID SUCH A GREAT JOB.
            - YEAH?
   - I MEAN, I WAS ROMANTIC.
       IT WAS A SURPRISE.

        I DID MY THING.
            - YEAH?
- I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY NOTHING.
   - TAMARA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

    SHE SAID MORE ROMANTIC.
            - WHAT?
            - BABE,
    WE HAD TO SAY SOMETHING.
       WHO SAYS NOTHING?

       - I'M JUST SAYIN'.
           - [sighs]
          - IT'S OKAY.
         WE'RE GONNA GO
TO THE NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.

        HOW MANY STUNTS
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
    YOUR LITTLE JACKIE CHAN
          CAN PULL OFF
       IN A SINGLE NIGHT?

             JODIE.
     - I'M GONNA GO WITH--
     I'M GONNA GO WITH TWO.
          - WITH TWO?
             - YES.

              TWO.
          - [laughing]
      - KENYALA, WHAT'D--
  - SOMETIMES BETTER, BUT TWO.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            KENYALA.

           both: TWO.
     [cheers and applause]
           - MARLON.

          SHE PROBABLY
       LOWERED MY NUMBER,
    SO I'M GONNA GO WITH...
CAN I SAY "TWO OR THREE," OR DO
  I HAVE TO SAY TWO OR THREE?

        - YOU GOTTA GIVE
    A SPECIFIC NUMBER, YES.
           - FOR ME,
   IT WOULD PROBABLY BE MORE,
   BUT BECAUSE SHE HAS TO GO
   TO WORK IN THE MORNING...

           [laughter]
      - I'M GONNA SAY TWO.
       - TWO. ALL RIGHT.
    TAMARA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            - DAMN.

            - THREE!
       - WE'VE DONE THAT
         BEFORE, BABE!
           [laughter]

          - ALL RIGHT.
     JEFF, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I'M GONNA GO WITH THREE.
         - WITH THREE?
    - YEAH, IT'S--YOU KNOW,

           A KIND OF
    A GOOD ROUND NUMBER OF--
       WE COULD PROBABLY
       GO MORE, YOU KNOW.
       USUALLY IT'S LESS.

    BUT, YOU KNOW, THREE IS,
    LIKE, THE HAPPY MEDIUM.
   - I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS,
        'CAUSE YOU KNOW,
      YOUR MOM IS SITTING
        RIGHT BEHIND ME.

        - YEAH, I KNOW.
       I KNOW. THAT'S...
           THANK YOU
     FOR POINTING THAT OUT
         AND MAKING IT
      MORE AWKWARD FOR ME.

            AWESOME.
            HI, MOM.
         HOW YOU DOING?
           [laughter]
    ANNA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

            - THREE!
             - YES.
       - AND I ALSO SAID,
    "AND MY MOTHER-IN-LAW'S
       IN THE AUDIENCE."

     - ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
         NEXT QUESTION.
   IF YOU AND YOUR WIFE WERE
   TO START YOUR OWN COUNTRY,
   WHAT DID SHE SAY WOULD BE

         THE FIRST LAW
  ENFORCED IN YOUR NEW NATION?
            MARLON.
  - THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO TALK
    BEFORE WE DID ANYTHING.

            - OKAY.
    TAMARA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        - I HAVE NO IDEA
    WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.
  - ALWAYS TREAT ANIMALS WELL.
   - YOU LIKE ANIMALS, BABE.

         YOU DON'T LIKE
   WHEN PEOPLE ABUSE ANIMALS.
     - YEAH, BUT STARTING--
     - WOMEN AND CHILDREN.
            - YEAH,
    BUT STARTING A COUNTRY,

      YOU'RE NOT THINKING
       ABOUT THE ANIMALS.
           [laughter]
           - OH, SEE?
     - I AM SO EMBARRASSED.
    NO, I AM SO EMBARRASSED.

    - THE KISS DIDN'T WORK?
             - NO.
         - YOU SAW HIM
     TRYING TO SNEAK--MWAH!
           [laughter]

      BEFORE SHE COULD SAY
         ANYTHING ELSE.
             OKAY.
     JEFF, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - WELL, IN OUR HOUSE,
       LAW NUMBER ONE IS

        THAT WE NEVER GO
         TO BED ANGRY.
      SO I WOULD HAVE SAY
  THAT THE FIRST LAW WOULD BE
  NOBODY IN OUR ENTIRE VILLAGE
  CAN GO TO BED WHEN ANGERED.

           [laughter]
           - ANNA...
        WHAT DID YOU SAY
       ABOUT THE VILLAGE?
        - NAKED MONDAYS.
        - NAKED MONDAYS!

            - WHAT?
         IT'S THURSDAY!
           THURSDAY.
       WELL, WE'RE GOING
     TO BED ANGRY TONIGHT.

           [laughter]
- YOU'RE BREAKING YOUR OWN RULE!
    - IT'S NOT OUR VILLAGE.
     - IT'S JOEY'S VILLAGE.
           - EXACTLY.

        - OH, BOY, OKAY.
    JODIE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      - MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE
      LIKES TO GET NAKED,
        SO I'M GONNA SAY
         NAKED SUNDAYS.

     - NAKED SUNDAYS, WHOO!
        - NAKED SUNDAYS.
     - ALL RIGHT, KENYALA,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - PROBABLY WAY OFF, BUT...
         - HE'S RIGHT.

       I DO LIKE TO SHUCK
     THOSE CLOTHES, BUT...
        I SAID BE SWEET.
          - BE SWEET.
- THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE SO RIGHT,
        AND I WAS WRONG.

           [laughter]
   - LOOK, KENYALA, HOW OFTEN
     ARE YOU RUNNING AROUND
     SHUCKING YOUR CLOTHES
          BEING NAKED?

        - ALL THE TIME.
  - WHEN THE KIDS AREN'T HOME,
           I'M NAKED.
         - OH, REALLY?
            - YEAH.
      - ALL THE TIME, HUH?

        - ALL THE TIME.
            - OKAY.
    MAYBE THAT'S WHAT MAKES
      THE WORLD GO ROUND--
      YOU JUST GET NAKED.

           ALL RIGHT,

      I SAID ON THE BEACH.

     FRIENDS AND RELATIVES
      PLACE YOUNG CHILDREN

     [cheers and applause]
       HE'S FROM ISRAEL,

      AND THEIR FIRST DATE
      WAS TO A TACO BELL,
      SO HE COULD FINALLY
       TRY MEXICAN FOOD.
     MEET OMER AND MONICA.

 SHE SURPRISED HIM WITH A TRIP
   TO THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.
     THEN HE SURPRISED HER
 WITH A PROPOSAL ON THE BEACH.
 GUESS IT PAYS TO KEEP SECRETS
       FROM YOUR PARTNER.

       HERE'S ED AND AMY.

   GENTLEMEN, THE FIRST TIME
   YOUR TRUSTY...TRAVEL GUIDE
    EXPLORED YOUR WIFE'S...
            VOLCANO,

     DID THE MOUNTAIN ERUPT
   IN AN EARTH-SHAKING EVENT,
    EXPERIENCE SMALL TREMORS
    WHILE REMAINING INTACT,
         OR FIZZLE OUT
   IN A SMALL PUFF OF SMOKE?

             OMER?
     - I WOULD PROBABLY SAY
     "ERUPT" AND THE REST.
         THE FIRST ONE.

        - THE FIRST ONE?
            - YEAH.
           - ERUPT IN
    AN EARTH-SHAKING EVENT.
             - YES.

         SINCE WE DID A
  LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP,
    SO SHE CAME TO VISIT ME
       ON THE FIRST TIME,
  SO AFTER, LIKE, THREE MONTHS
  WE NOT SEEING EACH OTHER...

             - OH.
  - IT WAS PRETTY GOOD, YEAH.
     - IT WAS AN ERUPTION.
            OH. ED?

  - UH, IT DEFINITELY ERUPTED
   IN AN EARTH-SHAKING EVENT.
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.
            IT WAS--
     IT WAS PRETTY MAGICAL.

    - WHAT ABOUT YOU, ALEX?
    - OH, WELL, I'LL GO WITH
   THE SECOND ONE, BECAUSE...
       - THE SECOND ONE.
          - YOU KNOW.

  - "EXPERIENCED SMALL TREMORS
    WHILE REMAINING INTACT."
    - 'CAUSE THE FIRST TIME,
        WE BOTH WEREN'T
  IN OUR RIGHT MIND, YOU KNOW.

   WE WERE BOTH HANGING OUT.
            - OKAY.
- SO I COULDN'T PERFORM THE WAY
  I REALLY WANTED TO PERFORM.
      SO LET'S JUST SAY...

   LET'S JUST SAY THE LIQUOR
      GOT THE BEST OF ME.
    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
         NEXT QUESTION.
 WHAT'S THE ONE THING YOUR WIFE
   WOULD BE OVERJOYED TO HEAR

        THAT YOU FINALLY
       GAVE UP FOR GOOD?
              ED?
           - SMOKING.

          EVEN THOUGH
    I DON'T SMOKE THAT MUCH,
   BUT EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE
         WHEN I DRINK,
    I DO SMOKE A LITTLE BIT,
     SO I WOULD SAY--YEAH.

            - ALEX?
     - PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.
       'CAUSE EVERY TIME
       I GET OUT OF WORK,

         THE LITTLE BIT
        OF TIME I HAVE,
   I HOP ON THE PLAYSTATION.
            - YEAH.

       - AND SHE DOESN'T
      LIKE THAT VERY MUCH.
       SHE SAID I SHOULD
      SPEND TIME WITH HER.
 BUT I DO SPEND TIME WITH HER.
        ON THE WEEKENDS.

        - OH, THAT'S SO
       VERY NICE OF YOU.
            - I DO.
    - OMER, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - I USED TO SMOKE A PIPE,
    AND MONICA DOESN'T LIKE
        SMOKING AT ALL,
     SO I GAVE UP FOR HER.

 - THAT'S SO VERY, VERY SWEET.
      ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

     "FORGET TELEMARKETERS.

       ON THE CALLER ID,
MY ABILITY TO PICK UP THE PHONE

             ALEX?
       - I HAVE A FRIEND.
       HIS NAME IS RANDY.
        WE DON'T REALLY
      LIKE HIM THAT MUCH.

   BUT HE ALWAYS BOTHERS US.
     HE WANTS TO COME OVER.
     HE WANTS TO HANG OUT.
 BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE ANY MONEY
        TO DO ANYTHING,

   SO EVERY TIME HE CALLS US,
          WE JUST SAY,
        "YOU KNOW WHAT?
  "LET'S JUST IGNORE THE CALL.

       LET'S JUST PRETEND
      WE'RE SOMEONE ELSE."
    - OMER, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - I WOULD PROBABLY
         CHOOSE NO ONE.

     - YOU'D CHOOSE NO ONE?
            - YEAH.
          - OKAY. ED?
       - OUR FRIEND WILL.

       JUST 'CAUSE I KNOW
       WHEN HE'S CALLING
   HE'S GONNA WANT TO GO OUT,
       AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
  GO OUT HARD ALL NIGHT LONG,

     AND I PROBABLY AM NOT
      WANTING TO DO THAT,
     SO I'M GONNA SAY WILL.

   WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE THING

  - SO I'M GONNA GO WITH SIZE.
             - AMY.
            - WELL,
     I KNOW HE'S GONNA KNOW

       THAT I WILL NEVER
          SAY "TASTE."
            - OKAY.
             - AW!
     AW, I'M SUCH A PRUDE.

           [laughter]
          - IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE EXERCISING YOUR OPTIONS.
  - AND I'M ALLERGIC TO NUTS,
     SO I'M GONNA SAY SIZE.

  - YOU'RE JUST GONNA GO SIZE.
            - YEAH.
            - AVENA?
       - HE CALLS HIMSELF
  THE TRINIDADIAN STALLION...

             - OH!
    - SO "SIZE" HANDS DOWN.
             SIZE.
    - ALL RIGHT. I LOVE IT.

     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.
      TO THE CLOSEST HOUR,
    WHAT TIME OF DAY WAS IT

       WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
  FIRST TOLD YOU HE LOVED YOU?
              AMY?
  - WE WERE ON A BOOZE CRUISE,

   SO AT SOME POINT THE HOURS
  ALL KIND OF MELDED INTO ONE.
            - YEAH?
        - UM...MIDNIGHT?
          - MIDNIGHT?
             OKAY.

     - IT WAS A LATE NIGHT.
            - AVENA?
       - WHEN WE STARTED
       OUR RELATIONSHIP,

         WE USED TO BE
    ON THE PHONE EVERY NIGHT
      UNTIL THE WEE HOURS
        OF THE MORNING,
        SO I'M GONNA SAY
        AROUND 2:00 a.m.

           - MONICA?
  - I WAS IN ISRAEL VISITING,
   AND WE WERE--WE HAD, LIKE,
 THESE REALLY INTENSE MOMENTS,

          AND HE LEFT,
       AND HE ACTUALLY--
          THAT MORNING
    WHEN I WAS GETTING READY
    TO GO BACK TO THE U.S.,
            LEAVING,

          HE FAXED ME
       THAT HE LOVED ME.
    I'M GONNA GO WITH NOON,
         BECAUSE THAT--
   THAT SEEMS LOGICAL TO ME.

   - HOW COME HE DIDN'T CALL?
         - I DON'T KNOW
        IF HE THOUGHT--
        HE THOUGHT MAYBE
      HE WOULDN'T GET ME,

         AND HE WANTED
  TO MAKE SURE THAT, YOU KNOW,
    I SAW IT BEFORE I LEFT,
      BECAUSE HE FELT LIKE
   IT WAS HANGING IN THE AIR,

      AND SO HE, YOU KNOW,
      HE PUT IT OUT THERE,
          AND I STILL,
     TO THIS DAY, ACTUALLY,
     I STILL HAVE THE FAX.

           - REALLY?
  - UM, THAT HE SENT ME, YEAH.
         - OH, MY GOSH.
         THAT IS GREAT.

            - OKAY.
           I LOVE IT.

            MONICA?
   - THIS ONE'S PRETTY EASY,
    BECAUSE I HAVE A FRIEND
   THAT I CAN'T SAY HER NAME

          WITHOUT OMER
       ACTUALLY BLUSHING
          AND GIGGLING
   LIKE A LITTLE SCHOOL GIRL.
            - YEAH.
- SO IT'D BE MY FRIEND HEATHER.

     THAT IS JUST THE MOST
 VOLUPTUOUS FRIEND THAT I KNOW,

    AND SHE'S JUST GOT IT IN
 THE FRONT, GOT IT IN THE BACK,
      SO I WOULD ASSUME--
     I MEAN, IF I WERE HIM,
       I WOULD PICK HER?

     WE EVER TOOK TOGETHER
  I WOULD SAY WAS OUR DELAYED
      HONEYMOON TO MEXICO,

     WHICH, UH, WAS ONLY--
WAS TWO YEARS AFTER OUR WEDDING.
           - MM-HMM.
     - UM, AND I WOULD SAY

       I DON'T THINK ANY
  OF OUR TRIPS WAS A DISASTER.
       - ALL RIGHT. AMY.
         - IT WOULD BE
      DOMINICAN REPUBLIC,

        AND THAT'S EASY,
     JUST BECAUSE THAT WAS
   A SURPRISE BIRTHDAY GIFT.
           - MM-HMM.

      - BUT ALSO THE TRIP
       WHERE HE PROPOSED,
         SO THAT'S A--
        HANDS DOWN EASY.
       I'M FROM UPSTATE.
       I'M FROM BUFFALO,

           SO I KNOW
   HE DOESN'T LIKE IT THERE.
           - MM-HMM.
       - SO I--I GUESS--

     I GUESS IT WOULD HAVE
      TO BE BUFFALO, THEN.
            - AVENA?
      - DEFINITELY JAMAICA
       IS THE BEST TRIP.

        THE SECOND ONE,
  I'M GONNA SAY CANADA, FOR...
           - CANADA.
        THE WORST TRIP.
        - THE REASON WHY
     IS WE WENT LAST YEAR,

        IT JUST HAPPENED
        TO BE A WEDDING,
          AND IT FELL
      ON OUR ANNIVERSARY,
  OUR FIRST YEAR ANNIVERSARY,

          AND AS SOON
        AS IT HIT 12:00,
   WE GOT BACK TO THE HOTEL,
   AND WE GOT THIS BIG FIGHT.
   HE'S NOT--HE'S DEFINITELY
        NOT GONNA SAY--

 HE'S NOT GONNA REMEMBER THAT.
     HE'S NOT THE BRIGHTEST
      CRAYON IN THE PACK.
- WELL, THANK GOD HE CAN RELY ON
THAT TRINIDADIAN STALLION LABEL.

             - YES.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.

 TO SEE IF THEY COULD MATCH THE

      NOW WE ALL LOVE THIS
      INTERNATIONAL FLAVOR
     COST PLUS WORLD MARKET
         HAS GIVEN US.

        HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,
   WHAT'S HER FAVORITE THING
     ABOUT YOUR CANDY BAR?

      THE SIZE, THE TASTE,
          OR THE NUTS?
             OMER?
      - PROBABLY THE SIZE?

             - YES?
            MONICA,
       HE LOOKS SO HAPPY.
  DID YOU SAY IT WAS THE SIZE?
         YES, YOU DID.

             - YAY!
          - ALL RIGHT.
              ED?
   - ALL RIGHT, WELL, I WISH
  MY ANSWER COULD BE "TASTE,"

         BUT IT'S NOT.
          IT'S "SIZE."
       - SO WHAT DID YOU
        SAY IT WOULD BE?
          - THE SIZE.
     - THE SIZE. ALL RIGHT.

             YEAH.
        ALL RIGHT, ALEX.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
        WITH THE TASTE?

       - THE TASTE? OKAY.
       - THE ONLY REASON,
WHEN I COME HOME WORK FROM LATE,
       SO I ALWAYS SHOWER
         RIGHT BEFORE.

            - YEAH.
         - SO I FIGURE
  I USE THIS WATERMELON SOAP.
             - OH!

             AVENA.
  ARE YOU GETTING A LITTLE BIT
   OF THAT WATERMELON, GIRL?
      SHE SAID "THE SIZE."
             - OH.

 - YOU ALWAYS CALL YOURSELF THE
TRINIDADIAN STALLION, DON'T YOU?
            - YEAH.
           [laughter]

            - IDIOT.
           - MY BAD.
          - HUSBANDS,
   THIS IS THE NEXT QUESTION.
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,

       WHAT TIME OF DAY,
      TO THE CLOSEST HOUR,
     WAS IT WHEN YOU FIRST
    TOLD HER YOU LOVED HER?
              ED?

      - IT'S PROBABLY 5:00
        IN THE MORNING.
       - DO YOU REMEMBER
   WHAT YOU WERE DOING, OR--?
    - YOU KNOW, WHAT YOU DO
    AT 5:00 IN THE MORNING.

           [laughter]
           - OH, GOD.
       - ALL RIGHT, AMY,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

  WAS IT 5:00 IN THE MORNING?
   - I--I SAID BECAUSE THINGS
   GOT A LITTLE BIT BLURRY...
         - MIDNIGHT ON
       THE BOOZE CRUISE.

           ALL RIGHT.
             ALEX.
   - I WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH,
           UH, 2:00?
            - 2:00?
     - 2:00 IN THE MORNING?

      - ALL RIGHT, AVENA.
  WAS IT 2:00 IN THE MORNING?
            - YEAH!
          - LET'S GO!

      2:00 IN THE MORNING.
           ALL RIGHT.
  YOU'RE STILL SMILING, OMER.

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - WELL, I SENT HER A FAX.
         - OKAY. A FAX.
         - A FAX, YEAH.

   SHE WAS IN ISRAEL AND SHE
  WAS CHECKING OUT THE HOTEL.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    - SO IT'S PROBABLY NOON?
         - WAS IT NOON?

          IT WAS NOON!
     [cheers and applause]
        OH, MY GOODNESS.

   SO I'M JUST CURIOUS, OMER.
     WHY DID YOU SEND A FAX
     INSTEAD OF GOING OVER
       AND TELLING MONICA

      THAT YOU LOVED HER?
 - IT'S BETTER THAN THE PHONE.
   - I LOVED IT. I LOVED IT.

   - YOU STILL HAVE THE FAX,
             RIGHT?
            - YEAH.
           - YOU SEE?
      - STILL GOT THE FAX.

    NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.

       BUT, YEAH, IT IS.
        - THAT'S SHERRY.

 I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ABOUT
 THOSE SHERRIES AND BIG BOOBS.
            I SWEAR.
        ALL RIGHT, OMER.

       IT'S JUST LIKE...

    - MONICA, IS IT HEATHER?

 BECAUSE YOU HATE GOING THERE.

       - WELL, I'M SORRY
    YOU GUYS HAD HALF RIGHT,
  BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO WIN.
         I'M SO SORRY.
         - SORRY, AMY.

      OUR FIRST VACATION.
           - UH-HUH.

        SOME QUESTIONS.
         ARE YOU READY?

     LET'S GET RIGHT TO IT.

    GENTLEMEN, IF THERE WAS
      AN AUDIENCE PRESENT
   DURING YOUR LAST SEX ROMP,
     WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING
      WOULD HAVE OCCURRED?

       A COLLECTIVE GASP,
      A BURST OF LAUGHTER,
     OR A STANDING OVATION?
           JONATHAN?

- PROBABLY A BURST OF LAUGHTER.
             - WHY?
      - UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?
       I'M NOT GONNA LIE.

  I DON'T THINK I'D EVER GIVE
   ANYONE A STANDING OVATION.
         BUT...I THINK
       I'M KIND OF CUTE.
          - ALL RIGHT.

           I LOVE IT.
              DON?
         - I'M NORMALLY
      A GASP KIND OF GUY,
BUT THE LAST TIME WAS DEFINITELY
    A STANDING OVATION TYPE.

  - IT WAS A STANDING OVATION
           THAT TIME?
     - YEAH, SHE WAS ASLEEP
 AND I WAS CLAPPING FOR MYSELF.
    [laughter and applause]

      - ALL RIGHT, JARED?
- I'M GONNA SAY A STANDING "O."
            - YEAH?

      - SHE'S HARD ON ME,
   SO SHE DOESN'T LET ME, UH,
      FINISH THE JOB UNTIL
     SHE'S GOOD TO GO, SO.
            - OKAY.

    HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE:
      WHEN I ASKED MY WIFE
          TO MARRY ME,

      THE VERY FIRST THING
           SHE DID--
   AND I MEAN THE VERY FIRST
      THING--WAS "BLANK."
              DON?

        - I BROUGHT HER
       INTO OUR BEDROOM--
       THE ONLY ROOM THAT
     HAD AIR CONDITIONING.
  IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER.
           - UH-HUH.

  - DROPPED TO A KNEE AND, UH,
           ASKED HER.
       I WAS REALLY, UH--
         I WAS NERVOUS.
            - YEAH?
   - BUT, YEAH, I ASKED HER.

            AND, UH,
  SHE KIND OF GIGGLED INSIDE.
           [laughter]
   SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY,
              UH--

         DESPITE THAT,
         I'M GONNA SAY
    THE FIRST THING SHE DID
        WAS SAY, "YES."
            - OKAY.
             JARED?

         - SHE YELLED.
           - SHE DID?
        - YEAH, SHE WAS
        VERY SURPRISED.
    - WHY WAS SHE SURPRISED?

    - I PUT CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
    ON THE, UH--ON THE HOUSE
     THAT SAID, "MARRY ME."
            - YEAH.
    - SO WHEN SHE CAME OUT--

   I ACTUALLY VIDEOTAPED IT,
       SO SHE BETTER NOT
       GET THIS WRONG...
           [laughter]
       BECAUSE WE GOT IT.

    WE GOT IT, HER YELLING.
     - YOU GOT IT ON TAPE.
            - YEAH.
       - OKAY, JONATHAN?
     - I'D GIVEN HER A CARD
      AND WE ACTUALLY MET

         DOING A SHOW,
 'CAUSE WE'RE BOTH PERFORMERS.
             - YES.
      - AND I WAS A CLOWN
       IN THAT SHOW, YES.

        AND IN HER CARD,
            I SAID,
"ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO SPEND
    YOUR LIFE WITH A CLOWN?"
         AND SHE SAID,
    "WELL, OF COURSE I DO."

      AND SO THEN I PULLED
     OUT THE RING AND SAID,
     "WELL, THEN WILL YOU?"
  AND SHE JUST LOOKED SHOCKED
        AND SAID, "YES."

         SO I WOULD SAY
       LOOKED SHOCKED...
            - OKAY.
    - AND THEN SAID, "YES."

        - OH, I LOVE IT.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS YOUR FINAL QUESTION.
  WHAT PRODUCT WOULD YOUR WIFE
    CONSIDER TO BE HER MVT--

    MOST VALUABLE TOILETRY?
             JARED?
 - I WOULD SAY HER HAIR DRYER.

       - HER HAIR DRYER?
            - YEAH.
  - ALL RIGHT, WHAT ABOUT YOU,
           JONATHAN?
  - I'M GOING WITH HAIR DRYER
    WHEN SHE HAS TO USE IT.

         - HAIR DRYER?
 - YEP, DEFINITELY HAIR DRYER.
          - OKAY, DON?
       - THERE IS A LOT.

    I'M GONNA GO WITH, UH--
          I'M GONNA GO
     WITH HAIRBRUSH THOUGH.
    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.

           NICE JOB.
       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,
       BECAUSE THE COUPLE
      WITH THE MOST POINTS

AT THE END OF THE GAME WILL WIN
  A FANTASTIC SECOND HONEYMOON
        TO THE BAHAMAS.

          - ALL RIGHT,
THE WIVES ARE BACK AND, LADIES,
  WHILE YOU WERE GONE, I ASKED
 YOUR HUSBANDS THREE QUESTIONS
AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY AND
      MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

  EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS WORTH
  FIVE POINTS, SO HERE WE GO.
       YOU READY, LADIES?
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.

          IF THERE WAS
      AN AUDIENCE PRESENT
   DURING YOUR LAST SEX ROMP,
     WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY

      WOULD HAVE OCCURRED?
      A BURST OF LAUGHTER,
       A COLLECTIVE GASP,
     OR A STANDING OVATION?

            HOLLIE?
     - A STANDING OVATION,
       BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
      YOU GOT TO SAY THAT
      ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND,

     BUT HE'S ALWAYS GOOD.
           [laughter]
    - SO YOU GOT TO SAY IT?
        DO YOU MEAN IT?
          - OF COURSE!
             YEAH.

          - ALL RIGHT.
             OKAY.
           JONATHAN?
      A BURST OF LAUGHTER.

          - OH, WHAT?
         - I'M A CLOWN.
 - I KNOW, BUT NOT IN THE BED.

          - THANK YOU.
   - YOU DIDN'T TELL US THAT.
 YOU'RE NOT A CLOWN IN THE BED.
        - WELL, THANKS.
       I APPRECIATE THAT.

             - UGH.
           - OH, NO.
     - ALL RIGHT, ADRIANNA?
- DEFINITELY A STANDING OVATION.

       IT WAS A GOOD ONE.
            - YEAH?
           - IT WAS.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    DON, WAS IT A GOOD ONE?

   IT WAS A STANDING OVATION.
            - YEAH!
            - NICE.
            - YEAH.
           [applause]

            JILLIAN?
     - A STANDING OVATION.
     - A STANDING OVATION?
          - OH, YEAH.

 WE MAKE MAGIC IN THE BEDROOM.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       ALL RIGHT, JARED?

    GOT A STANDING OVATION.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
           [applause]
          - GOOD JOB.

          - I LOVE IT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

      WHEN I ASKED MY WIFE
          TO MARRY ME,
      THE VERY FIRST THING
           SHE DID--
   AND I MEAN THE VERY FIRST
      THING--WAS "BLANK."

           ADRIANNA?
          - I PAUSED.
        I MADE HIM WAIT
    FOR PROBABLY 30 SECONDS

   BEFORE I GAVE HIM ANYTHING
            AT ALL.
             - AHH.
              DON?

    HE SAID YOU SAID, "YES."
           - [laughs]
             WELL--
      - WAS IT THAT QUICK?

       - AFTER THE PAUSE.
            - YEAH.
  - DO YOU REMEMBER THE PAUSE?
         - NOT REALLY.
           [laughter]

           - JILLIAN?
  - UM, I SAID, "OH, MY GOD,"
     PROBABLY 5,000 TIMES.

    - JARED, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      HE SAID YOU YELLED.
      - OH, WELL, YELLED,
         "OH, MY GOD."

        - WE'LL TAKE IT.
        WE WILL TAKE IT.
     [cheers and applause]
          YES, IT IS.

     IT'S HARD TO JUST SAY,
         "OH, MY GOD."
            HOLLIE?
        - I SAID, "YES,"
           OF COURSE,

   BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING
      ABOUT IT FOR A WHILE
 AND, UH, AFTERWARDS I REMEMBER
       GETTING VERY HOT,
   AND, UH, HE WAS ASKING ME
         IF I WAS OKAY.

     BUT IT WAS DEFINITELY
             A YES,
      BECAUSE I WAS LIKE,
          "OF COURSE."
            - OKAY.
           JONATHAN?

        LOOKED SHOCKED.
            - WHAT?
 I WAS DEFINITELY NOT SHOCKED.

  - YOU WERE TOTALLY SHOCKED.
             - AWW!
        - I'M OBVIOUSLY
      A GOOD ACTRESS THEN.

          [crowd oohs]
- YOU BEEN TAKIN' ALL KINDS OF--
              NO!

          PUT THAT ON.
       YOU KEEP THAT ON.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.

   ACCORDING TO YOUR HUSBAND,
  WHAT PRODUCT DID HE SAY YOU
   CONSIDER TO BE YOUR MVT--
    MOST VALUABLE TOILETRY?

            JILLIAN?
          - MY MAKEUP.
      - ALL RIGHT, JARED?

    HE SAID YOUR HAIR DRYER.
         - HAIR DRYER.
           - OH, OOH.
            - YEAH.
      - I COULD GO WITHOUT
        THE HAIR DRYER.

      - IT WAS A TOSS UP.
          - OOH, YEAH.
       THAT'S A BAD ONE.
            - OKAY.
            - SORRY.

           - HOLLIE?
  - FACE WIPE, BECAUSE I HAVE
     TO USE THEM EVERY DAY.
 - TO WIPE OFF THE MAKEUP, HUH?
            - YEAH.

       - THE FACE WIPES.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      HE SAID HAIR DRYER.
             - UGH!
           [giggles]

          - I'M SORRY.
         MY NAME'S JON.
         - HAIR DRYER?
           [laughter]
             - HI.
       NICE TO MEET YOU.

           [applause]
   - I DON'T USE A HAIR DRYER
           EVERY DAY!
  - ADRIANNA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

   - UH, I'M GONNA SAY SOAP.
      I WAS MY HANDS ABOUT
       1,000 TIMES A DAY.
            - OKAY.

    AND WHAT'D YOU SAY, DON?
   - I'M JUST GONNA STICK IT
       IN THE HOLE THERE.
    - UH, HE SAID HAIRBRUSH.

   - I COULDN'T THINK OF ONE.
       I COULDN'T THINK.
      THERE'S, LIKE, NINE.
       - ALL RIGHT, WELL,
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.

       JARED AND JILLIAN,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH TEN POINTS.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         TIME TO ANSWER
        A FEW QUESTIONS.

   THESE NEXT THREE ARE WORTH
        TEN POINTS EACH.
         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.
      - OKAY, HERE'S YOUR
        FIRST QUESTION.

  WAS YOUR LAST ARGUMENT MORE
  LIKE A BORDER DEBATE BETWEEN
      THE U.S. AND CANADA,
      ENGLAND AND IRELAND,

         OR NORTH KOREA
        AND SOUTH KOREA?
            HOLLIE?
         - I'D ONLY SAY
         THE SECOND ONE

    BECAUSE I'M FROM ENGLAND
  AND HE'S BEEN AN IRISH TENOR
           IN A SHOW.
            - OKAY.
          - SO, UH...

      LET'S MAKE IT A BIT
         MORE LITERAL.
    - ALL RIGHT, I HEAR YOU.
      ENGLAND AND IRELAND.
             - YES.
          - ALL RIGHT.

           ADRIANNA?
  - UM, WE DON'T REALLY ARGUE
         ALL THAT MUCH.
   I'LL SAY U.S. AND CANADA.

       - U.S. AND CANADA?
             OKAY.
            JILLIAN?
       - UM, I'D SAY U.S.
        AND CANADA TOO.

       WE'RE PRETTY EVEN
    AND IF I RAISE TOO HIGH,
    HE BRINGS ME BACK DOWN,
  SO I'D SAY U.S. AND CANADA.
            - OKAY.
          ALL RIGHTY.

     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
        IN ORDER TO KEEP
       A LIFETIME OF SEX
       WITH YOUR HUSBAND
      INTERESTING FOR YOU,

      WHAT WOULD YOU WANT
 TO DO MORE OF IN THE BEDROOM?
           ADRIANNA?
   - THERE'S NOT A WHOLE LOT
          WE DON'T DO.

             - OH!
           - [laughs]
  - SO MANY THINGS DONE, HUH?
  - UM, WELL, HOW ABOUT THINGS
    OUTSIDE OF THE BEDROOM?

  - LIKE, WHERE WOULD YOU WANT
             TO GO?
       - ANYWHERE OUTSIDE
        OF THE BEDROOM.
        OF THE BEDROOM?

             - YES.
            - OKAY.
            JILLIAN?
     - I WOULD SAY PROBABLY
    MORE ROLE-PLAYING MAYBE.

      - WHAT KIND OF ROLES
    WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY?
        - I DON'T KNOW.
      MAYBE DOCTOR, NURSE.
           YOU KNOW,
     HE'S A POLICE OFFICER,

   SO MAYBE I'LL PLAY VICTIM.
         I DON'T KNOW.
             - OH!
              OH!

   OFFICER, IS THAT YOUR GUN?
             OKAY.
            HOLLIE?

            - UM...
    PROBABLY MORE ME ON TOP,
      BECAUSE HE NORMALLY
       LIKES TO BE THE...

 DOMINANT, MORE AGGRESSIVE ONE
      IN OUR RELATIONSHIP,
         SO THEREFORE,
      WE'LL SWITCH IT UP.
          - THE CLOWN?
        - YEAH, I KNOW.

     HARD TO BELIEVE, HUH?
             - OH.
      SO YOU WANT TO PLAY
        RIDE THE CLOWN?
    [laughter and applause]

      - WELL, WHEN YOU PUT
         IT LIKE THAT.
    - NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
  HOW OFTEN WOULD YOU SAY YOUR
   HUSBAND FINDS IT NECESSARY

    TO SPEND SOME ALONE TIME
      WITH HIS BEST FRIEND
   WHO LIVES BELOW HIS BELT?
            JILLIAN?

       - I'D SAY PROBABLY
       FIVE TIMES A WEEK.
      - FIVE TIMES A WEEK?
            - YEAH.
  - THAT SOUNDS NORMAL TO ME.

           [laughter]
            HOLLIE?
          - I'D SAY HE
        DOESN'T HAVE TO

     BECAUSE HE GETS IT ALL
            FROM ME.
          - OH, OKAY.
     [cheers and applause]
           ALL RIGHT.
           ADRIANNA?

         - MY HUSBAND'S
      LIKE A TEENAGE BOY.
           EVERY DAY.
          - EVERY DAY?
      - NO MATTER HOW MUCH
    HE'S GETTING, EVERY DAY.

     - IT'S--SO EVERY DAY?
             OKAY.
LADIES, HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.

 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE:

    THE GUEST THAT TRAVELED
          THE FURTHEST
  TO OUR WEDDING WAS "BLANK,"
  WHILE THE GUEST I WOULD HAVE
     LIKED TO SHIP FAR AWAY

    WOULD HAVE BEEN "BLANK."
            HOLLIE?
          - OUR FRIEND
      SULLY'S MOM DEBBIE,

        BECAUSE SHE CAME
   ALL THE WAY FROM ENGLAND.
  SHE DIDN'T COME SPECIFICALLY
        FOR OUR WEDDING,
 BUT SHE ENDED UP BEING THERE,
     WHICH IS REALLY NICE.

    - OH, SHE JUST HAPPENED
  TO BE, LIKE, THERE AND SHE--
 - SHE WAS JUST IN THE VICINITY
    AND THOUGHT, "WHY NOT?"
    AND THEN THE SECOND ONE
         WOULD PROBABLY

      BE OUR OTHER FRIEND,
   WHO I WON'T SAY HER NAME.
       - WHAT'S HER NAME?
   - CATHY, BECAUSE SHE JUST
    KIND OF INVITED HERSELF.

             - AHH.
    SO DEBBIE JUST HAPPENED
          TO BE THERE
   AND CATHY INVITED HERSELF?

             - YES.
       YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.
  - I LOVE YOUR GUESTS, GIRL.
      ALL RIGHT, ADRIANNA?

   - UM, THE FRIEND WHO CAME
     FROM THE FARTHEST AWAY
       WAS MY FRIEND JOE.
      HE CAME FROM HAWAII.

          - ALL RIGHT.
  - AND THE ONE I WOULD RATHER
          NOT BE THERE
WAS THE ONLY KID WHO SHOWED UP.

          IT WAS, UM,
      MY DAD'S BOSS'S SON.
           - OH, MAN.
            JILLIAN?
    - UM, I'D SAY MY BROTHER
       CAME THE FURTHEST.

    HE WAS COMING FROM L.A.
 AND WE GOT MARRIED IN MEXICO.
 AND THEN, ALTHOUGH I LOVE HIM,
    UH, JARED'S COUSIN GREG.
   UM, HE ALMOST LIT MY DRESS
    ON FIRE WITH HIS CIGAR.

  SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO COME.
            - WHAT?
             - YES.
     - HOW DID HE DO THAT?
   - THEY WERE HOISTING ME UP
           IN A CHAIR

       AND HE WAS HELPING
     AND HE HAD A LIT CIGAR
  AND THANKFULLY JARED'S MOM--
   THE DRESS STARTED TO SMOKE
        AND JARED'S MOM

    GRABBED THE CIGAR BEFORE
    MY DRESS WENT IN FLAMES.
     - HE COULDN'T EVEN PUT
      THE CIGAR OUT, HUH?
             - NO.
          - ALL RIGHT.

       BUT WHAT'S YOUR--
  WHAT'S YOUR BROTHER'S NAME?
            - GLENN.
         - GLENN, OKAY.
   LADIES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

  WE'LL SEE IF THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

        WITH TEN POINTS.
       DON AND ADRIANNA,
   YOU GUYS HAVE FIVE POINTS.
      JONATHAN AND HOLLIE,
         YOU DON'T HAVE

        ANY POINTS YET,
        BUT WE'RE STILL
      RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE
          OF THE GAME.
           ALL RIGHT.

    FELLAS, HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
           GENTLEMEN,
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,
     WAS YOUR LAST ARGUMENT
   MORE LIKE A BORDER DEBATE

  BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CANADA,
      ENGLAND AND IRELAND,
         OR NORTH KOREA
        AND SOUTH KOREA?

           JONATHAN?
        - I'M GONNA HAVE
     TO SAY U.S. AND CANADA
          JUST BECAUSE
     WE'RE PRETTY PEACEABLE

   AND WE DON'T REALLY ARGUE
           THAT MUCH.
       ALTHOUGH I'M TORN,
       BECAUSE I REALLY--
     YOU'RE BRITISH, SO...

           [laughter]
     I'M GONNA GO WITH, UH,
        U.S. AND CANADA.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            HOLLIE?

      ENGLAND AND IRELAND.
          - AYE-YI-YI!
     - I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
       I'M FROM ENGLAND.

     YOU'RE AN IRISH TENOR.
 - I KNOW YOU'RE FROM ENGLAND.
        - I KNOW NOTHING
        ABOUT POLITICS.
             - DON?
       - GIRL, SERIOUSLY.

      - I'M GONNA GO U.S.
          AND CANADA.
      WE NEVER REALLY HAVE
        ANYTHING SERIOUS
     TO REALLY ARGUE ABOUT.

IT'S USUALLY ABOUT ME NOT DOING
      DISHES OR SOMETHING.
          - [chuckles]
      - SO I DON'T SEE IT
   BEING ANY WORSE THAN THAT.

     - ALL RIGHT, ADRIANNA?
       - U.S. AND CANADA.
         - THAT'S WHAT
       I'M TALKING ABOUT.

           [applause]
            - YEAH.
     JARED, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - I'M GONNA SAY U.S.
          AND CANADA.
      WE'RE PRETTY DECENT.
  WE, UH--I COMPROMISE A LOT.

          I'M CANADA.
            - YEAH?
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT COMPROMISES
         ALL THE TIME?
        - YEAH, I, UH--

     I ALWAYS COMPROMISE...
            - YEAH.
  - AND I THINK IT'S VERY SAFE
            AND, UH,
      I'M GONNA SAY U.S.,
            CANADA.

   - WHAT'D YOU SAY, JILLIAN?
       - U.S. AND CANADA.
             - YES!
           GOOD JOB.

           [applause]
          - ALL RIGHT.
  GENTLEMEN, IN ORDER TO KEEP
   A LIFETIME OF SEX WITH YOU
      INTERESTING FOR HER,

  WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY SHE'D
  WANT MORE OF IN THE BEDROOM?
              DON?
      - GOING DOWN SOUTH.

             - OHH.
            - YEAH.
     I'D PROBABLY SAY THAT.
  - GOING DOWN TO YOUR BORDER,
              HUH?

    - SHE RESPONDS TO THAT.
  - UH, PRETTY MUCH EVERYBODY
           DOES, DON.
           ALL RIGHT.

           [laughter]
   ADRIANNA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   - THAT'S NOT WHAT I SAID.

       - TAKE IT OUTSIDE.
        - I SAID OUTSIDE
        OF THE BEDROOM.
