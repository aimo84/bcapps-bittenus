             - OH!

            - WELL--
    - JARED, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I'M REALLY--LET'S GO
    WITH WHAT DON SAID AND,

    YOU KNOW, GO DOWN SOUTH.
     ALTHOUGH I DO IT NOW,
           IT'S, UH--
      I WOULD SAY IT'S ONE
       OF HER FAVORITES.

           [laughter]
           - JILLIAN,
   SHOULD HE KEEP DOING THAT?
      ROLE-PLAYING, JARED.
     - I SAID ROLE-PLAYING.

     YOU GOT TO SPICE IT UP
         A LITTLE BIT.
  THAT MIGHT GET BORING AFTER
   25 YEARS OF BEING MARRIED.
   - WE'VE NEVER ROLE-PLAYED
            THOUGH.

        - YEAH, COME ON!
         - THAT'S WHY.
        - YOU'RE A COP!
 THERE'S SO MANY THINGS TO DO.

     DON'T TAKE ME TO JAIL,
            OFFICER.
            COME ON!
      - MIGHT HAVE TO TRY
      THAT TONIGHT THOUGH.

         - YOU ALREADY
    GOT THE UNIFORM, JARED.
      ALL RIGHT, JONATHAN?
    - I'M JUST GONNA GO OUT
   ON A LIMB AND SAY THE EAR.

      - SO SHE WOULD WANT
       MORE OF YOUR EARS?
         - YEAH, SHE--
           [laughter]
SHE WOULD WANT UNFETTERED ACCESS
          TO MY EARS.

  - SHE WOULD WANT UNFETTERED
      ACCESS TO YOUR EARS?
  - TO BITE THEM, TO TUG THEM,
  AND TO JUST GENERALLY--UGH.
     - WHAT IS STOPPING HER
  FROM GETTING TO THESE EARS?

             - ME.
           - REALLY?
       ARE YOU SENSITIVE?
       - IT GETS ANNOYING
         AFTER A WHILE.

           - REALLY?
         - JUST--UNGH!
    STOP TUGGING AT MY EARS.
        - OKAY, HOLLIE,
CAN YOU LEAVE THOSE EARS ALONE?

        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   SHE SAID WITH HER ON TOP.
           [laughter]

      ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,
     HOW OFTEN DID SHE SAY
     YOU FIND IT NECESSARY
    TO SPEND SOME ALONE TIME

     WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND
   WHO LIVES BELOW YOUR BELT?
             JARED?
     - I'D SAY ONCE A DAY.

         - ONCE A DAY?
    - DEFINITELY FEEL BETTER
        ONCE IT'S DONE.
           [laughter]

            - OKAY.
    JILLIAN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       FIVE TIMES A WEEK.

        - THAT'S CLOSE.
   - SO WE'RE TWO DAYS SHORT.
           - COME ON.
  YOU KNOW I DO IT EVERY DAY.

           - GOT YOU.
           JONATHAN?
            - FOUR.
            - FOUR?
        - LET'S GO FOUR.

       - WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         SHE SAID NONE.
   - I THOUGHT I WAS ENOUGH!

        - I HAVE NEEDS!
           [laughter]
    WE'RE GETTING DIVORCED,
           AREN'T WE?

             - NO.
        ALL RIGHT, DON,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - THIS ONE BETTER BE A LAY-UP.

          ONCE A DAY.
         - ONCE A DAY?
           ALL RIGHT.
   WHAT'D YOU SAY, ADRIANNA?

          - EVERY DAY.
          - THAT'S A--
         NO, THIS HAND.
           [applause]

   - LET'S SEE WHAT WE HAVE.
       DON AND ADRIANNA,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 25 POINTS.

         STICK AROUND.
    OUR FINAL BONUS QUESTION
          IS COMING UP
       AND IT IS WORTH UP
         TO 30 POINTS,

      SO ANYBODY CAN WIN.
         DON'T GO AWAY.
     [cheers and applause]

 Well the kids wanted a puppy,
     but they can be really
           expensive.
 So to save money I just found
         them a possum.

    Dad, I think he's dead.
 Probably just playin' possum.
       SFX: Possum hisses

          There he is.
 There's an easier way to save.
             GEICO.

        Fifteen minutes
 could save you fifteen percent
   or more on car insurance.
   [ Mom ] TO ME, CHEX IS NOT
  JUST A LITTLE BOWL OF CEREAL,

    IT'S KIND OF A BIG DEAL.
      CHEX HAS FIVE FLAVORS
      THAT ARE GLUTEN-FREE.
       EVEN A CINNAMON ONE
         THE KIDS LOVE.

  THE WORD "WOW" COMES TO MIND.
 <i>[ Male Announcer ] CHEX CEREAL.</i>

        WITH 25 POINTS.
       IT IS TIME FOR OUR
        FINAL QUESTION.

  IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
  THIS CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.
   ALL RIGHT, ARE YOU READY?

  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    THE GUEST THAT TRAVELED
          THE FURTHEST
  TO OUR WEDDING WAS "BLANK,"

        WHILE THE GUEST
       I WOULD HAVE LIKED
        TO SHIP FAR AWAY
    WOULD HAVE BEEN "BLANK."
           JONATHAN?

 - THE GUEST THAT CAME FARTHEST
        AWAY WAS DEBBIE.
         SHE'S ENGLISH,
   SO SHE CAME FROM ENGLAND.
            - OKAY.

         - SO SHE CAME
    FROM THE FARTHEST AWAY.
      AND THE ONE TO GO--
       PUT FARTHEST AWAY
     WOULD HAVE BEEN CATHY.

          - WHY CATHY?
  - SHE'S A VERY LOVELY GIRL.
           [laughter]

          - ALL RIGHT.
      - BUT SHE'S LOVELY.
         SHE'S LOVELY.
  - HOLLIE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

   - YAY! YOU GOT ONE RIGHT!
      - DEBBIE AND CATHY!
           [applause]

           ALL RIGHT.
          - COME HERE.

     JARED, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         - FARTHEST WAS
       HER BROTHER GLENN.

          - ALL RIGHT.
  - THEY CAME FROM CALIFORNIA.
          THE ONE THAT
        WOULD I WANT OUT

        WOULD EITHER BE
         MY COUSIN GREG
        OR HER SISTER'S
    NOW EX-BOYFRIEND JESSE.
  I JUST DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE
     SHE DOESN'T LIKE MORE.

           [laughter]
  I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY JESSE.
       - GLENN AND JESSE.

   JILLIAN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - GLENN AND GREG.
 - GREG ALMOST BURNT MY DRESS!

       - I FORGOT HE DID.
        WE STILL GOT 15.
           [laughter]

           [applause]
     - YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
        ALL RIGHT, DON,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - WELL, THE ONE THAT CAME
       THE FURTHEST AWAY
      WAS HER FRIEND JOE.
   THE ONE WE'D SEND FURTHEST
          WOULD BE...

        I GUESS I'LL GO
      WITH MY FRIEND MATT.
       - SO JOE AND MATT.
   WHAT'D YOU SAY, ADRIANNA?

         JOE AND YOUR--
    AND MY DEAD BOSS'S SON.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
  - I ALMOST THOUGHT OF THAT.
         - BUT YOU GUYS
        ARE THE WINNERS.

        CONGRATULATIONS,
       DON AND ADRIANNA.
      YOU'RE THE WINNERS.

      IN HER CANDY CHEST?
          RAISINETTES,
         GOOD N PLENTY,
           OR MOUNDS?
             DAVE?

    - OH, BOY! SHE LIKES ALL
         THREE OF THEM.
             - AH!
         - AND SO DO I.
            - OKAY.

      - WE'RE GOING TO GO
      WITH...RAISINETTES.
           - GONNA GO
     WITH THE RAISINETTES.
 - YES, IT'S HER FAVORITE CANDY

   WHEN WE GO TO THE MOVIES.
     AND IT'S, SHE KEEPS IT
 IN A SPOT I LIKE TO GRAB THEM.
          - OH! OKAY!
     NICK, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT
     CANDY AT ALL ARE YOU?
           [laughter]
        I'D HAVE TO SAY
         GOOD N PLENTY.

        - GOOD N PLENTY?
       - 'CAUSE SHE'S GOT
 EVERYTHING IN THE RIGHT SPOT.
          - ALL RIGHT!
  AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, KENNETH?

         - I WOULD SAY
         GOOD N PLENTY,
     BECAUSE IT'S GOOD AND
    I CAN GET PLENTY OF IT.
          - ALL RIGHT!
           ALL RIGHT!

          THAT--WHOO!
    GENTLEMEN, IF YOUR WIFE
       HANDED ME A SHEET
    LISTING HER TOP TEN MOST
   EMBARRASSING CONFESSIONS.

       WHAT DO YOU THINK
   SHE'D RANK AS NUMBER ONE?
             NICK?
         - SHE ACTUALLY
     TRIPPED THE OTHER WEEK

          AND SHE FELT
     DIRECTLY ON HER FACE,
      SHE IS GOING TO HATE
    THAT I SAID THAT ON TV,
     BUT I'LL GO WITH THAT.
        - OKAY. KENNETH?

      - SHE HAS A--SHE HAS
   A FEAR OF VOMIT, YOU KNOW.
      AND SHE'S A TEACHER,
      SO SHE HAD A STUDENT
      ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW,
       VOMIT IN HER CLASS

  AND SHE REALLY DIDN'T HANDLE
  IT APPROPRIATELY, YOU KNOW.
        - OKAY, GOT YOU.
        ALL RIGHT, DAVE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - ONE TIME WHEN SHE WAS OUT
        WALKING THE DOG,
      SHE ACTUALLY TRIPPED
           AND LANDED
   BOTH HANDS DOWN ON CEMENT

     AND EVENTUALLY NEEDED
    SURGERY ON ONE OF THEM.
      - HOW WERE THE DOGS?
         - DOG'S GOOD.
            - YEAH!
       [audience laughs]

      ALRIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
        FINAL QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
 IF MY WIFE HAD BEEN THE MODEL
   FOR THE STATUE OF LIBERTY,

        SHE'D BE HOLDING
      A BLANK IN HER HAND
      INSTEAD OF A TORCH.
            KENNETH?
     - SHE WOULD BE HOLDING
           AN APPLE.

          - AN APPLE?
        - WITH HER BEING
    A TEACHER AND, YOU KNOW,
      THAT'S--THAT'S WHY.
       - MM-HMM, GOT YOU.

             DAVE?
         - THAT'S EASY,
    SHE BE HOLDING UP MONEY.
        - SHE BE HOLD--

   - MOUNDS, BECAUSE HE LOVES
          THE MOUNDS.
       - OKAY! I LOVE IT.
           ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

      HE SAID RAISINETTES.
     - THAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
         CANDY, HONEY!
         - BUT YOU LIKE
         MOUNDS BETTER.

        - I LOVE MOUNDS.
       - HE LOVES MOUNDS.
           YEAH, SEE?
         THERE YOU GO!
         OKAY, HEATHER,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
         GOOD N PLENTY.
   - WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
   -BECAUSE I GOT THE GOODS.

        - AH! ALL RIGHT.
    NICK, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        - GOOD N PLENTY.
     [cheers and applause]

          - ALL RIGHT.
            TRAYCE?
     - I AM KIND OF SKINNY,
  BUT HE ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL
      LIKE I'M, YOU KNOW,
      GOOD AND PLENTIFUL.

        - OH, I LOVE IT!
 KENNETH, DO YOU MAKE HER FEEL
      GOOD AND PLENTIFUL?
          - I TRY TOO.
          - ALL RIGHT.

   - WELL, LIFT UP YOUR CARD
   AND LET US SEE IF YOU DO--
           ALL RIGHT!
             - AHH!

        - THERE YOU GO.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      QUESTION NUMBER TWO.
    IF YOU HANDED ME A SHEET

   LISTING YOUR TOP TEN MOST
   EMBARRASSING CONFESSIONS,
     WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND
       SAY YOU WOULD RANK
         AS NUMBER ONE?

            HEATHER?
    - WHEN I FEEL ON MY FACE
   LIKE TWO, THREE WEEKS AGO.
           - OH, NO!
 SO YOU JUST, LIKE, WIPED OUT?

            - YEAH.
             - OOH!
ALL RIGHT, WHAT DO YOU SAY NICK?
        - YEAH, IT WAS.
           [applause]

         - OH, MY GOD!
    [laughter and applause]
         - I LOVE NICK.

             "YEAH!
     SHE FELL ON HER FACE!"
           [laughter]
            TRAYCE?

   - OKAY, SO I'M EMBARRASSED
     EVEN TO JUST SAY THIS,
           BUT I HAVE
       A REALLY BAD HABIT

            OF, UM,
      PICKING MY TOENAILS
          IN THE BED,
   AND THEN I HAVE THIS THING

        WHERE I PUT 'EM
          TO THE SIDE,
    AND THEN I KIND OF LIKE
    BALL THEM UP, AND THEN--
       [audience groans]

            EAT 'EM.
       BUT, I MEAN, IT IS
      EMBARRASSING, BUT--
         - MAYBE THAT'S
     WHY YOU ARE SO SKINNY.

       YOU GOT TO STOP--
      THERE'S NO NUTRITION
          IN TOENAILS.
   NO PROTEIN, NOT ANYTHING.

           ALL RIGHT.
   KENNETH, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I SAID HER FEAR
          OF VOMITING.
    -YOUR FEAR OF THE VOMIT.

       - YEAH, I'M SORRY.
             YEAH.
  - AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, NANCI?
         - WHEN I FELL
        WALKING MY DOG.

     - OH! WAS IT THE DOGS
      THAT MADE YOU FALL?
    - NO, IT'S THE SIDEWALK.
           [laughter]
        - THAT HAPPENS!

         THAT SIDEWALK,
 YOU'RE WALKING THE SIDEWALK--
      - HE PROBABLY WON'T
REMEMBER THAT, BUT THAT'S OKAY.
       - WELL, LET'S SEE.
    DAVE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

       - OH, YES I WILL.
     [cheers and applause]
            WOO-HOO!

    SHE FELL, AND I'M GLAD.
           [laughter]
- MAKING UP FOR THAT RAISINETTES
      COMMENT, AREN'T YOU?

             - YEP.
       - FINAL QUESTION.
  LADIES, HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
 IF MY WIFE HAD BEEN THE MODEL
   FOR THE STATUE OF LIBERTY,

      SHE WOULD BE HOLDING
      A BLANK IN HER HAND
      INSTEAD OF A TORCH.
            TRAYCE?

      WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
          - I'M SORRY!
    I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
 WHAT I WOULD HOLD IN MY HAND.
           [laughter]

    LET'S GO WITH A--A BOOK.
        - OKAY, KENNETH,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - I SAID AN APPLE, BECAUSE
    SHE IS A SCHOOL TEACHER.

         audience: AWW!
          - AN APPLE?
 - OKAY, NANCI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - THAT WOULD BE
         A...DING DONG.

         - A DING DONG.
             OKAY,
    LIKE DING DONG THE FOOD?
           - OH, NO.
     [cheers and applause]

           [laughter]
       - OH, MY GOODNESS!
        WHEN YOU COME ON
        <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>

         YOU JUST GOTTA
       OPEN UP YOUR MIND.
          OKAY, SO NOT
      DING DONG THE FOOD.
        - AND YOUR HAND.
  - I LOVE THIS ROAD OF VISION

     WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

         HE THINKS YOU'RE NAKED.
             IT JUST LOOKS LIKE

            TRAYCE?
       - HE TAKES FOREVER
         TO GET READY.

         AND ALL THAT?
             OKAY.
             NANCI?
       - WHEN HE CLEANS.
      - HOW DOES HE CLEAN?

         - LIKE WOMAN.
         HE'S THOROUGH.
       GETS THE JOB DONE.
    HE PROBABLY EVEN DOES IT
       BETTER THAN I DO.

          - ALL RIGHT.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.

         audience: AWW!
            - OKAY.
  - I CAN'T THINK OF ONE THING
   THAT I HAD TO GET USED TO.

      - WE CAN TAKE THAT,
       WE ABSOLUTELY CAN.

       - THERE IS NOTHING
 WRONG WITH IT, BUT I GUESS...

         WITH HIS NOSE?
     - HE'S GOT A BIG NOSE.
     - WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
          LOOK AT IT.

   - DON'T STARE--DON'T STARE

        A STATION WAGON.
       - A STATION WAGON.
       WHY DID SAY THAT?

    - BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY
 NOT GONNA BEAT THE OTHER CARS,
       BUT IT WILL GET TO
 THE FINISH LINE PRETTY QUICK.
          - ALL RIGHT!

   HEATHER, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        - STATION WAGON!
            - YEAH!
     [cheers and applause]

          - ALL RIGHT.
            KENNETH?
 - I WOULD SAY A STATION WAGON,
        BECAUSE YOU HOP
      IN THE STATION WAGON

      WHEN YOU'RE GOING ON
          A LONG RIDE.
    YOU KNOW, SO IT WOULD BE
    SO I SAY STATION WAGON.

     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
      QUESTION NUMBER TWO.
   HOW DID YOUR WIFE COMPLETE
         THIS SENTENCE?

   MY HUSBAND PRIDES HIMSELF
       ON BEING ALL MAN,
  BUT I COULD SWEAR I MARRIED
    A WOMAN WHEN HE BLANKS.
             NICK?
       - WHEN I'M TIRED.

             UM...
        - HOW DO YOU ACT
        WHEN I'M TIRED?
     - I GET PRETTY GRUMPY
         WHEN I'M TIRED

      AND SHORT-TEMPERED,
           AND--AND--
         I GUESS I ACT
        LIKE A BIG BABY.
        - OKAY, HEATHER,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?

         - I SAID WHEN
      YOU'RE GETTING READY
    BECAUSE YOU TAKE LONGER
    THAN I DO TO GET READY.
         - THAT'S TRUE.
          THAT'S TRUE.

            - OKAY.
   DID YOU HEAR HOW HIS VOICE
       WENT UP AND JUST,
         "THAT'S TRUE."

         - [deep voice]
      THAT'S WRONG, HONEY.
  - I TELL YOU WHAT YOU THINK.
           [laughter]

          - I'M SORRY.
   - KENNETH, WHAT WOULD SAY?
    - SHE WOULD PROBABLY SAY
   WHEN I'M GETTING DRESSED.

    YOU KNOW, I LIKE TO MAKE
       SURE I'M--YOU KNOW
 HIT THE NOOKS AND THE CRANNIES
  AND I AM LOOKING APPROPRIATE
        BEFORE I LEAVE,

       AND SHE ALWAYS...
       DOES THE OPPOSITE.
       BUT I WOULD SAY--
     NO, I WAS JUST JOKING.
          I'M JOKING.
           - REALLY?

       - SHE DOESN'T HIT
  THE NOOKS AND THE CRANNIES?
      - I GUESS THAT SHE'S
       EATING FINGERNAIL
    AND TOENAIL, MAYBE NOT.
           [laughter]

        MAYBE NOT, UH...
             - NOW,

     TO GET US FAST AND YOU
   TOOK US RIGHT BACK THERE.

         - I APOLOGIZE.

            BUT YOU,
    YOU TAKE TOO MUCH TIME.
   TRAYCE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

    - YOU BETTER HE BE GLAD.
         - GETS READY.
    - I SAID IT TAKES A BIT
         TO GET READY.
          - ALL RIGHT!

     DAVE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I'M GONNA SAY, UM,
        WHEN I COMPLAIN.
       SOMETIMES WE HAVE
    DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS,

      I COMPLAIN AND I GET
     LITTLE LIKE, YOU KNOW,
        "WHAT'S WRONG?"
           [laughter]

             NANCI,
     DOES HE GET LIKE THAT?
       - NO, HE DOESN'T.
          I DON'T KNOW
    WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

         - YOU SAID...
       - WHEN HE CLEANS!
        'CAUSE HE CLEANS
      BETTER THAN A WOMAN.
            - YEAH.
      - ANY WOMEN I KNOW.

 - YOU CAN EAT IN MY BATHROOM.
           -OH, WOW!
      THAT'S PRETTY CLEAN.
          - OH, YEAH.
            - OKAY!

     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    NOBODY IS PERFECT, GUYS.
  SO WHICH OF YOUR BODY PARTS
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY

         TOOK THE MOST

        AND I STILL HAVE
    A LITTLE BIT OF STOMACH,
      SO MAYBE MY STOMACH.
            - OKAY.
   TRAYCE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     - I'M SO EMBARRASSED,
   BECAUSE I'M SUCH A CRIER,
       AND I WANT TO CRY,
    BUT I SAID HE'S PERFECT.
      - SHE SAID NOTHING.
             - OH!

              AWW!
         THAT'S SWEET!
       THAT'S SWEET BABY.
