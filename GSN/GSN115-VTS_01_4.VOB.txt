I don't know, maybe you're warm

  In any case, come on in and

     the house money away.

You've learned well.
           Oh, yeah.
That is a beautiful coat.
           Thank you.
Does it have writing
on the side of it?

        No, It's an old
      tuxedo jacket, Dick,
      that this woman buys
 and finds in an antique places
        and hand paints,

       and they're really
       collector's items.
But I believe
she must have signed it.
       Oh, maybe she did.
       Yes, as a matter of fact,
       she did signed it.
       Well, she should.

You mean, that's the first time
you've ever seen it?
  Yes, she has her autograph
            on me.
Well, stand up and let's see it.
             What?
Stand up here.

        Whoever you are,
       there's your name.
Right on the pocket,

Where are you from?
      I'm from Phoenix Arizona.
      What are you doing
      out here?

       I'm just here to have fun
              and play the game.
You mean you came
all the way from Arizona
to play this silly game?
                    Yes, I did.

Oh, I hope you win
a lot of money.
                       So do I.
At least enough
to get back home.
                  That's right.
               It's nice to have
               you here, Vicky.
               Good luck.

 Michael, how are you, sir?
   I'm fine. Happy to be back
        for my last day.
    I never know what to say
   when you say how are you.

              I...
Well, you could give me
your complete rundown
in your medical history
for the last week or two.
  Healthy, I got a sore back.

   But then other than that,
     I've been fairly well.
Alright.
Now, I'm sorry I asked.
   Yeah, I know you would be.

Well, on the house.
                           Yes.
And you've won some money.

Okay.
                            Oh!

It's an exam.
                         Right.
                 And it goes off
                 in the morning.

Your alarm clock.
               And in the middle
               of a production,
           a theater production,
           it's called the...

Intermission.
                         Right.
                And you take a--

           is called...
A recess.
                         Right.
         And working out hard--

         I don't know,
 you gave me the perfect answer
  about a Friday and you want

  I just wanted-- It's Friday

Very tasty.

The rules
of the game state,
if you come
to the Winner's Circle
the first time
you try for $10,000,

now it really doesn't matter
how much you win,
if you win enough
to get back the second time
and if you win that side
and you come back
the second time.

because you're up
to $25,000.
Let us assume the possible.
You win $25,000,
now the $10,000 does not count.

People will know
that they win both.
No.
This is an aggregate sum.
We move you up
to the 25,000-dollar level.

Parts of your lawn.

Take your usual chair.
                          Yeah.
There you go again.

    [indistinct chattering]
       I'll...slip over this way
              a little bit here.
      Uh, no, I was afraid
you're gonna get hanged up on it

     and you would say lawn
     or something and say--
I was just skirting around
the word lawn.
           Pinch me.

           We said this would be
                 a nice way to--
            Do you have any idea
            how much $25,000 is?
                          Yeah.
I don't have any idea
how much it is.

I mean, to get--
What did you get now?
       11 seconds left, that's--
                     [gibberish]

                    49 seconds?
49 seconds.
                    Pretty good.
            You've had good day.
          Yes, I have.
  You know, we rarely ever talk
            about these things.

There's just never enough time.
                      This time,
          they give me a second.
         How are you gonna spend
                     your money?

     Well, after I pay off
         all my debts,
     then my husband and I
want to take a second honeymoon,
      our 15th anniversary
          in November,

    and then maybe I'll buy
    a new car or something.
                       Terrific.
        You're only on your way,
           there's more to come.

           We'll talk about that
   in a second right after this.
 Congratulations.
      Thank you, Michael.
         You're great.

    Oh, that's nice, very nice.

        I've worked hard
       to build m my family.
  And also to build my career.

 So I'm not about to always let
   my frequent bladder urges,
      or the worry my pipes
    might leak get in the way
     of my busy lifestyle.

     That's why I take care,
         with VESIcare.
  Once-daily VESIcare can help
   control your bladder muscle
     and is proven to treat
       overactive bladder

        with symptoms of
    frequent urges and leaks
         day and night.
 If you have certain stomach or
       glaucoma problems,

      or trouble emptying
         your bladder,
     do not take VESIcare.
   VESIcare may cause allergic
 reactions that may be serious.

  If you experience swelling of
         the face, lips,
        throat or tongue,
      stop taking VESIcare
     and get emergency help.

 Tell your doctor right away if
 you have severe abdominal pain,
 or become constipated for three
          or more days.
          VESIcare may
      cause blurred vision,

  so use caution while driving
     or doing unsafe tasks.
       Common side effects
  are dry mouth, constipation,
        and indigestion.

        I've worked hard
     to get to where I am...
       and I've got better
          places to go
           than always
     going to the bathroom.

 So take charge of your symptoms
    by talking to your doctor
     and go to vesicare.com
     for a free trial offer.
Janis, you will come back,
won't you?

          Oh, I've had

 How are you on a Monday?
       Great. Thank you.
You look good.
You look very fresh

we're in the middle
of a summer somewhere.
          Thank you.
         How are you?
Very well.
The gentleman next to you

who is a theater manager.
Wes, where do you do
your theater managing?
               Century City here
                 in Los Angeles.

What are we going to see
this summer in theaters?
          What's hot?
              What's coming up?
   What's hot is not necessarily
           what's in my theater.

      [audience laughing]
          Say no more.
        I could get you
    in so much trouble here.

    This is merely a hobby.
          I don't want
    to jeopardize your job.
   Nathan, how are you, sir?

                I'm doing fine.
Happy to have you aboard.
This has been "Hotel" here
for the last couple of weeks.
We had Michael Spound.
      Yes, Michael was on
          last week.

     I'll try to do better.
You will have to, at least,

is Vicky Collins from Arizona,

who has won
a considerable amount of money.
Vicky, how much so far?
                        $26,100.

Good start.

of what's almost a perfect game.
From one-- For one answer,
it could very well

tilt the other way.
If they come up
with 7 out of 7,
    Wes, you'll have to wait
     until the next round.

   At the moment, you've got
    20 points, they have 14.

      on the other side?
                   I'd like to.

 in looking at you in profile--

         Would you look
     at Nathan Cook again?
Have you folks seen

If ever Kurt needs

Oh, golly.
I can't tell you
how many times
when Bingo comes up,
people say,

"Well, that's the game

       [ Dad ] I'm usually
     checking g up on my kids.
    But last year my daughter
     was checking up on me.
      I wasn't eating well.

        She's a dietitian
     and she suggested I try
BOOST Complete Nutritional Drink
    to help get the nutrition
         I was missing.

    Now I drink it every day,
   and I love the great taste.
