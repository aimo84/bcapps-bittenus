          YOU KNOW HOW
     KIDS LOVE TO PLAY TAG.
     MEET LEO AND CARRISA.

HE THINKS IT'S HOT THAT HIS WIFE
  HAS THREE <i>STAR WARS</i> TATTOOS.
      IS THAT A LIGHTSABER
         IN HIS POCKET,
      OR IS HE JUST HAPPY
          TO SEE HER?

   HERE ARE AARON AND ASHLEY.
    AND THEY MET AT A PARTY
        TO WATCH <i>90210.</i>
     THE SEX, THE INTRIGUE,
      THE STOLEN GLANCES,

       HELLO, EVERYBODY.
              HI!
       HELLO, AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>

       HELLO, GENTLEMEN.
         - HI, SHERRI.
  - I LOVE THE BRIGHT SMILES.
      YOU ARE READY TO GO.
      - AND WE ARE READY.
            - OKAY.

       WELL, WE HAVE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
    WE'LL GET RIGHT INTO IT.

 GENTLEMEN, BASED ON THE NUMBER
        OF ADULT MOVIES
       YOUR WIFE HAS SEEN
          IN HER LIFE,
       WHO DOES SHE HAVE
     MORE IN COMMON WITH--

        AN AMISH FARMER,
      A COLLEGE FRAT BOY,
       OR CHARLIE SHEEN?

              LEO.
         - WELL, I KNOW
      SHE'S SEEN VERY FEW.
            I HOPE.
           - UH-HUH.

    - I'M GONNA SAY THE, UM,
       COLLEGE FRAT BOY.
      - ALL RIGHT. AARON.
    - JUST ON THE SAFE SIDE,
    I'M GONNA SAY THE, UH--
     THE COLLEGE FRAT BOY.

      - COLLEGE FRAT BOY.
            - YEAH.
       - OKAY. REINALDO.
    - MY WIFE IS VERY PRUDE,
         SO DEFINITELY
      THE AMISH SHEPHERD.

        I'LL BE SHOCKED
   IF SHE SAYS ANYTHING ELSE.
    - AN AMISH FARMER, HUH?
    - YEAH, AN AMISH FARMER.
      YEAH. I WISH SHE WAS
      LIKE CHARLIE SHEEN,

    BUT IT'S NOT HAPPENIN'.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
WHAT'S THE ONE THING YOU CAN DO
  THAT'LL MAKE YOUR WIFE LAUGH

    UNTIL HER STOMACH HURTS?
             AARON.
       - I WOULD SAY IT'S
    THE STUPID THINGS I SAY,
        BECAUSE I ALWAYS
         SAY SOMETHING

       THAT JUST DOESN'T
     MAKE SENSE WHATSOEVER.
          - LIKE WHAT?
   - WELL, THERE WAS ONE TIME
  WHERE I, UH--I WAS ON A DATE
        WITH, UH, ASHLEY

AND I ACCIDENTALLY TOLD HER THAT
 HER HAIR WAS NICE AND FRIZZY.
          - OOH-WHEE!
           REINALDO.

 - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY DANCE...
       - WHEN YOU DANCE?
    - 'CAUSE I DON'T REALLY
          DANCE A LOT
AND SHE'S LIKE A DANCING BUNNY,
 SO, LIKE, SHE'S ALWAYS, LIKE--

         THERE'S A JOKE
        IN OUR BUILDING,
       LIKE, SHE BECOMES
       "DANCING BARBARA,"
        AND SHE'LL JUST
       TAKE OVER A PARTY,

  LIKE, IT'S JUST RIDICULOUS.
    I'M, LIKE, CALM AND COOL
          IN THE BACK.
         WHEN I GET UP,
  SHE'LL JUST START LAUGHING,

  'CAUSE I REALLY DON'T DANCE.
          - OKAY. LEO.
      - I THINK SHE'LL SAY
       JUST BEING MYSELF.
    - SO JUST BEING YOURSELF
        MAKES HER LAUGH?

        - JUST BEING ME.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   FINAL QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
        THE WORST ADVICE
      MY WIFE EVER GAVE ME

       WAS ABOUT "BLANK."
           REINALDO.
            - MONEY.
         - ABOUT MONEY?
    - YEAH, WITHOUT A DOUBT.

     - WHAT ADVICE DID SHE
           GIVE YOU?
 - UH, SHE CANNOT EVEN ATTEMPT
TO TELL ME ABOUT DEBT AND STUFF,
    'CAUSE, LIKE, I'M, LIKE,
     REAL FRUGAL AND STUFF,

AND, LIKE, SHE'LL JUST BE LIKE,
   "YOU NEED TO SPEND MORE."
        I'M LIKE, "NO."
          - OKAY. LEO.
     - I THINK HOW I DRESS.
           - MM-HMM.

 - SHE ALWAYS TRIES TO TELL ME
     HOW TO--HOW TO DRESS,
    AND I THINK I CAN DO IT
        OKAY BY MYSELF.
          - ALL RIGHT.
           AND AARON.

    - SHE DOESN'T LIKE, UH,
THE WAY THAT I DRESS SOMETIMES.
    SOMETIMES I DON'T MATCH,
           YOU KNOW,
    JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
      WE'RE JUST GOING OUT

      TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE
 OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT, SO...
        - SO WHY MATCH?
      IT'S ONLY A FRIEND.
        - WELL, EXACTLY.
   IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.

         ALL MY FRIENDS
      DON'T MATCH ANYWAYS.
        - OKAY, FELLAS,
  THANK YOU SO MUCH, NICE JOB.

         I DON'T KNOW,
   I CAN'T SAY IT'S ANXIETY,
  BUT IT'S JUST KIND OF LIKE,
       "I'M GONNA SMILE,

      "'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW

       - YEAH. OH, YEAH.

TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.

      HERE WE GO, LADIES.
      BASED ON THE NUMBER
        OF ADULT MOVIES
   YOU'VE SEEN IN YOUR LIFE,

      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
  YOU HAVE MORE IN COMMON WITH
        AN AMISH FARMER,
      A COLLEGE FRAT BOY,

       OR CHARLIE SHEEN?
            CARRISA.
           - [laughs]
 I'VE SEEN A FEW RACY MOVIES...

            - YEAH?
            - UM...
      SO I'M GOING TO SAY
          A FRAT BOY.
         - A FRAT BOY.
      LEO, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

     - THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
          - FRAT BOY.
             - YAY!
    - GIVE HER A KISS, LEO.

       ALL RIGHT. ASHLEY.
    - I DEFINITELY HAVE SEEN
    A COUPLE IN MY LIFETIME,
    SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
     WITH, UM, A FRAT BOY.

    - AARON, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
 - GOTTA GO WITH THE FRAT BOY.
          - FRAT BOY.
            - YEAH.

            BARBARA.
   - WELL, I AM THE COMPLETE
   OPPOSITE OF CHARLIE SHEEN,
      SO HE PROBABLY SAID
        AN AMISH FARMER,

  'CAUSE I AM ONE OF THE MOST
    CONSERVATIVE GIRLS EVER.
    - ALL RIGHT, WHAT'D YOU
         SAY, REINALDO?
       - I KNOW MY WIFE.
    - AMISH FARMER, YOU DO.

        - YEAH, YOU DO.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
  YOUR HUSBAND SAID HE CAN DO

     THAT'LL MAKE YOU LAUGH
   UNTIL YOUR STOMACH HURTS?
            ASHLEY.
       - I'D HAVE TO SAY
   WHEN HE BLOWS A RASPBERRY
          ON MY TUMMY,

      'CAUSE HE JUST KEEPS
        GOIN' AND GOIN',
   AND I CAN'T STOP LAUGHIN',
      AND IT'S--IT'S BAD,
 AND THEN HE'S IN TROUBLE THEN.

 - SO THOSE RASPBERRY BLOWERS.
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     AARON, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            - I SAID
    THE STUPID THINGS I SAY,

   BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE TIME
  THAT I SAY SOMETHING STUPID,
       YOU GET MAD AT ME,
BUT THEN YOU ALWAYS MAKE IT INTO
    A FUNNY JOKE AFTERWARDS.

           - OHH. AW.
            - YEAH.
       - AW, THAT'S NICE.
    - SUCH A ROMANTIC REASON
WHY HE GOT IT WRONG, I LOVE IT.

- I KNOW, I CAN'T BE MAD AT HIM
           FOR THAT.
     - ALL RIGHT. BARBARA.
        - I HAVE TO SAY,
    WHENEVER I GET TICKLED,
  ESPECIALLY UNDER MY ARMPITS,

     I'M THE MOST TICKLISH
          PERSON EVER.
            - YEAH?
   - YEAH, SO I WON'T LET HIM
   TOUCH ME UNDER MY ARMPITS.
            - OKAY.

            - YEAH.
          - REINALDO.
        - I SAID DANCE.
       - WHEN YOU DANCE.
         - DANCE? WHAT?
  - YOU'RE THE DANCING BUNNY.

 YOU ARE THE LIFE OF THE PARTY.
 - YOU'RE THE DANCING BARBARA.
         THEN I GET UP
 AND TRY TO COMPETE WITH THAT.
    IT'S JUST NOT HAPPENIN'.

       - OH, I DON'T KNOW
       ABOUT THAT ANSWER.
            - OKAY.
          - OH, WELL.
   - WHAT ABOUT YOU, CARRISA?
  - I WOULD SAY AN IMPRESSION,

    BECAUSE HE DOES--HE DOES
     SOME GOOD IMPRESSIONS
      OF SOME MOVIE STARS
AND PEOPLE IN OUR FAMILY, AND...
    - WHAT--WHAT'S THE BEST
      IMPRESSION HE'S GOT?

       - I WOULD SAY, UH,
         ROCKY BALBOA.
        - ROCKY BALBOA.
       - LEO, WHAT'S YOUR
    ROCKY BALBOA IMPRESSION?

      - [as Rocky Balboa]
          YO, ADRIAN.
 DO YOU WANT TO GO TO THE ZOO?
            - YEAH.

        I LIKE THAT ONE.
           ALL RIGHT,
      WHAT'D YOU SAY, LEO?
     HE SAID BEING HIMSELF.
     - COMPLETE OPPOSITE--

    - NO, WE CAN'T TAKE IT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
      - ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

        THE WORST ADVICE
      MY WIFE EVER GAVE ME
       WAS ABOUT "BLANK."
            BARBARA.

       - WAS ABOUT SPORTS
          OR FOOTBALL.
          - REINALDO.
        - I SAID MONEY.
            - MONEY!
    - SHE'S NOT RESPONSIBLE

          WITH MONEY.
      - YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.
          - OH, OKAY.
   - YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
        - OKAY. CARRISA.

        - SOME DEALINGS
        WITH HIS FAMILY.
          - OKAY. LEO.
         HOW TO DRESS.
          - MY FAMILY?

    - I GIVE YOU BAD ADVICE
      ABOUT HOW TO DRESS?
          LOOK AT YOU.
      - WELL, WHO CAME UP
         WITH THE IDEA?

  BECAUSE I LOVE THAT YOU GUYS
     ARE COLOR-COORDINATED.
  WHO CAME UP WITH THAT IDEA?
       YOU DID, CARRISA.
           - SHE DID.
          - OF COURSE.

             - OHH.
   - MOST OF THE TIME, BUT...
      - BUT THE TIMES THAT
   SHE DOESN'T, YOU FEEL LIKE
   YOU CAN DO IT BY YOURSELF.
      - I THINK SO, RIGHT?

- I DON'T KNOW, YOU LOOK GREAT--
          - THANK YOU.
 - WE'LL SEND YOU THE PICTURES.
         YOU CAN VOTE.
        - OKAY. ASHLEY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - I'D HAVE TO SAY,
    I DON'T GIVE BAD ADVICE
        ABOUT ANYTHING.
     EVERYTHING I TELL HIM
           IS RIGHT,

        AND IF HE KNOWS
      WHAT'S GOOD FOR HIM,
   THAT'S WHAT HE WOULD SAY.
            - OKAY.
         WELL, YOU ARE
      ONE CONFIDENT LADY.

     AARON, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - UH, HOW TO DRESS.
        - HOW TO DRESS.
           - [scoffs]
         - I-I STARTED
      TO JUST THINK ABOUT

   HOW I DRESS, AND I'M LIKE,
         WAIT A SECOND,
   I DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT,
         SO I'M SORRY.
        - I THINK YOU'RE
       BACKPEDALING HERE.

- I DID BACKPEDAL A LITTLE BIT,
            SO YEAH.
     - ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE

            CARRISA.
  - CLEARLY, AND I'M SO SORRY,
       BUT THIS WOULD BE
       MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.

      - YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW
       AND YOUR HUSBAND.
  - THEY BUTT HEADS EVERY TIME
      THEY SEE EACH OTHER.
           - REALLY?
- ON THE PHONE, IN PERSON, YEAH.

        - OKAY. ASHLEY.
   - I'D HAVE TO SAY HIS MOM.
        UM, THEY'RE BOTH
   REALLY STUBBORN PEOPLE...

   IT'D HAVE TO BE CARLOS...

    - OKAY. LADIES, THIS IS
       THE NEXT QUESTION.

   IF YOUR HUSBAND'S MANHOOD
   SUDDENLY STARTED TALKING,
 WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST WORDS
       OUT OF ITS MOUTH--
    "WHERE YOU BEEN, BABY?"

       "WANNA GO AGAIN?"
      OR "BOY, I COULD USE
          SOME REST"?
            ASHLEY.

  - UM, I THINK HE WOULD SAY,
    "BOY, I NEED SOME REST."
           - UH-HUH.
            - UM...
 I'M PREGNANT, AND DEFINITELY--

          - ALL RIGHT.
        GOTCHA. BARBARA.
     - IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
       "WANNA GO AGAIN?"
      - "WANNA GO AGAIN?"

     ALL DAY, ALL NIGHT...
            - OKAY.
  - OVER AND OVER AGAIN, YEAH.
     - ALL RIGHT. CARRISA.

     - I WOULD PROBABLY SAY
      "I NEED SOME REST."
        I AM READY TO GO
        MOSTLY ANYTIME.

            - OKAY.
          - SO...YEAH.
    I THINK MAYBE HE'D WANT
        A LITTLE BREAK.
    - OKAY. THIS IS THE NEXT
       QUESTION, LADIES.

   IF YOUR HUSBAND WAS GIVING
         A GUIDED TOUR
     OF HIS FAVORITE SPOTS
      IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
 WHAT WOULD THE FIRST STOP BE?

            BARBARA.
 - A FOOTBALL FIELD SOMEWHERE,
        TO PLAY FOOTBALL
 AT ONE OF HIS FOOTBALL FIELDS,
     LOCAL FOOTBALL FIELDS.

        - OKAY. CARRISA.
       - HE'D WANT TO GO
       TO A PIZZA PARLOR.
       - HE LOVES PIZZA.

         - PIZZA IS HIS
     AND MY FAVORITE, SO...
        - OKAY. ASHLEY.
     - UM, I'D HAVE TO SAY
     A BAR THAT'S NEAR US.

       HE LIKES TO GO OUT
        WITH HIS BUDDIES
     AND HAVE A FEW DRINKS,
  ESPECIALLY SINCE, YOU KNOW,
    I CAN'T JOIN HIM, SO...

            - YEAH.
 - HE LIKES TO GO THERE A LOT.
            - OKAY.
    - MAYBE GET AWAY FROM ME
  AND MY, YOU KNOW, HORMONES.

           - EXACTLY.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
   HERE IS A BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
     BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,
 THE ONE WHO WOULD LOOK BETTER
      IN A SLEEVELESS TANK
          IS "BLANK,"

      IT WOULD BE "BLANK."
            CARRISA.

   - HE HAS SOME NICE GUNS...
            - OKAY.
    - SO HE WOULD LOOK GOOD
     IN A SLEEVELESS TANK.
    UM, MY ARMS ARE MY LEAST
      FAVORITE PART OF ME,

     AND, UH, I WOULD ROCK
       THE SHORT SHORTS.
           - ASHLEY.
       - I'D HAVE TO SAY
        ME FOR THE ARMS.

    UM, YOU KNOW, HE'S BEEN
  COMPLAINING ABOUT HIS ARMS,
SAYING THEY'RE NOT THAT STRONG,
         SO I THINK...
           - UH-HUH.
   - I'D SAY ME FOR THE ARMS.

     AND I THINK I'D SAY ME
   FOR THE SHORT SHORTS, TOO.
    I GOT PRETTY NICE LEGS.
            - OKAY.
 - MY LEGS ARE BETTER THAN HIS.
       - SO YOU FOR BOTH.

            - YEAH.
     - ALL RIGHT. BARBARA.
    - I WOULD SAY DEFINITELY
          ME AND ME...
   - YOU AND YOU, ALL RIGHT.
        - FOR BOTH, YES.

     - OKAY, WELCOME BACK,
           GENTLEMEN.

 I AM SO GLAD THAT YOU'RE BACK,
  BECAUSE NOW WE'RE GONNA SEE
  IF YOU CAN MATCH THE ANSWERS
     THAT YOUR WIVES GAVE,
     BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT,
 WE HAVE TO CHECK ON THE SCORE.

YOU ARE ALL TIED FOR FIRST PLACE
       WITH FIVE POINTS.
     [cheers and applause]
     OKAY, SO, GENTLEMEN...
       HERE IS THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.

       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       IF YOU WANT TO SEE
     EXPLOSIVE REALITY TV,
 LOCK MY HUSBAND AND "BLANK" UP
      IN A ROOM TOGETHER,

   AND LET THE CAMERAS ROLL.
              LEO.
   - THIS IS EASY--MY MOTHER.
         - YOUR MOTHER.
  - SHE'S JUST OUT OF CONTROL.

            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.
     - ALL RIGHT, CARRISA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
           YOUR MOM.
          - YOUR MOM!

 - WHEN YOU SAY YOUR MOM IS OUT
 OF CONTROL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
      - SHE WILL JUST SAY
   WHATEVER SHE WANTS TO SAY.
    SHE'LL CALL PEOPLE UGLY.

             - OHH.
          - SHE'LL SAY
      YOUR COOKING STINKS.
           - REALLY?
        - YES, YES, YES.

   - HOW'D YOU GET ALONG WITH
  YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW, CARRISA,
    WHEN YOU FIRST MET HER?
- WE FIRST MET, IT WAS AWESOME.
  - OKAY, WHEN YOU FIRST MET.
           - UH-HUH.

    - HOW--HOW ARE YOU NOW?
  - I'D SAY I'M NOT THE LEAST
   FAVORITE DAUGHTER-IN-LAW.
        SO THAT'S GOOD.
 - OKAY. AARON, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - UH, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
      MY MOTHER, AS WELL,
  BECAUSE MY MOM ALWAYS LIKES
       TO SPEAK HER MIND
     AND SHE NEVER REALLY,
     UH, APPROVED AT FIRST

    ABOUT, UM, ME AND ASHLEY
      TOGETHER, BUT, UH--
        - WHY DIDN'T SHE
       APPROVE OF ASHLEY?
   WAS ASHLEY THIS <i>BAD</i> GIRL?
   - IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS--

       I WAS BEING STOLEN
      AWAY FROM MY MOTHER.
             - OHH.
  - YEAH, SO SHE DIDN'T LIKE--
    - ASHLEY, YOU TOOK AARON
    AWAY FROM HIS MAMA, HUH?

    - YEAH, WHAT CAN I SAY?
         - "I GOT HIM."
            - YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT
          DID YOU SAY?

       - I SAID HIS MOM.
          - YOUR MOM.
          - ALL RIGHT.
           - [laughs]
      ALL RIGHT, REINALDO,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - I'M GONNA GO WAY OUT
   IN LEFT FIELD ON THIS ONE.
     I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
        MY COUSIN CHINO,
       A.K.A. CHOCOLATE--
      - YOUR COUSIN CHINO?

    - 'CAUSE WHEN WE DRINK,
     HE COULD LITERALLY BE
       ON TV BY HIMSELF.
         - OH, REALLY?
  - I WOULDN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE
       IN THE ROOM, YEAH.

     - ALL RIGHT, BARBARA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
  - CARLOS, A.K.A. CHOCO-LOTS.
            - OKAY.
      - I LOVE YOU, BABY.

 - YOU GUYS ALL HAVE 15 POINTS.
           ALL RIGHT.
   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
        IF YOUR MANHOOD
   SUDDENLY STARTED TALKING,

  DID YOUR WIFE SAY THE FIRST
WORDS OUT OF ITS MOUTH WOULD BE
    "WHERE YOU BEEN, BABY?"
       "WANNA GO AGAIN?"

      OR "BOY, I COULD USE
          SOME REST"?
             AARON.
     - UH, THE SECOND ONE.
          WHERE, UH--
  - THE ONE, "WANNA GO AGAIN?"

  - YES, "YOU WANNA GO AGAIN?"
          BECAUSE, UH,
   SHE ALWAYS, ALWAYS LOVES,
         LOVES THE, UH,
      YOU KNOW, UH, YEAH--

 THE FUN TIMES, LET'S CALL IT.
        "THE FUN TIMES."
- SHE LOVES THE FUN TIMES, HUH?
          - YEAH, YES.
  - OKAY, ASHLEY, DO YOU LOVE
         THE FUN TIMES?

     - I DO, I SAID, UH...
   - YOU COULD USE SOME REST.
 - YEAH, WE GOTTA GET IT IN NOW
 WHILE WE STILL CAN, YOU KNOW?
         - I GUESS SO.
     - ALL RIGHT, REINALDO.

   - I WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH
       "WHERE YOU BEEN?"
       'CAUSE I COULD GO,
        LIKE, EVERY DAY,
BUT SHE'S MORE LIKE ONCE A WEEK.
        - OKAY, BARBARA.

   - I SAID "WANNA GO AGAIN?"
      - "WANNA GO AGAIN."
      - BECAUSE YOU CAN GO
      ALL DAY, EVERY DAY.
     - OH, THAT'S MY FAULT.

         - AND THAT WAS
     THE WORST ANSWER EVER.
      - SO WHO WANTS TO GO
      ALL DAY, EVERY DAY?
     - HE COULD GO ALL DAY,
           EVERY DAY.

    - AND WHAT'S YOUR SPEED?
     - I MAY NOT WANT TO GO
      ALL DAY, EVERY DAY,
BUT HE WOULD WANT TO GO AGAIN...
            - YEAH.

          - SO I WOULD
       IF YOU WANTED TO,
        BUT THAT ANSWER
     WAS NOT A GOOD ANSWER.
- WELL, SHE SAID IT RIGHT HERE,
        SHE'D GO AGAIN.

     - THAT'S GOOD FOR ME.
            - YEAH.
         - IT'S WRONG!
           - NO. LEO.

- SEEING THAT I'M SO MUCH OLDER
          THAN SHE IS,
  I'M GONNA SAY THE THIRD ONE,
          NEED A REST.
       - OH, NEED A REST?

     YOU LOOK LIKE YOU GOT
     A LOT OF ENERGY TO ME.
           - THANKS.
     - ALL RIGHT. [laughs]
    CARRISA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

    "I COULD USE SOME REST."
     - USE SOME REST. WHOO!
            - OKAY.
        THIS IS OUR NEXT
      QUESTION, HUSBANDS.

       IF YOU WERE GIVING
         A GUIDED TOUR
     OF YOUR FAVORITE SPOTS
      IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
     WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY
    THE FIRST STOP WOULD BE?

           REINALDO.
     - IT COULD BE ANY ONE
        OF MANY BARS...
            - YEAH?

    - SO I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
            THE 101.
           - THE 101?
             OKAY.
- 'CAUSE DURING FOOTBALL SEASON,
         I LIVE THERE.

     LIKE, FANTASY FOOTBALL
          IS ALL I DO.
           - BARBARA.
   - I SAID A FOOTBALL FIELD
    TO PLAY FOOTBALL, BUT--

  - SHE SAID A FOOTBALL FIELD.
           - BUT IT--
    IT WAS THE WORST ANSWER.
 YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY 100% RIGHT.
           - [laughs]

          - I'M SORRY.
   - YOU'RE RIGHT, I'M WRONG.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             - AW.
       - IT'S ALL RIGHT.

 - YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAPE THAT.
   YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW IF
 YOU MIGHT HEAR THAT ONE AGAIN.
  - CAN I GET A COPY OF THAT?
     - OKAY, THAT'S LIKE--
    PUT THAT AS A RINGTONE.

   - IT'LL EVEN OUT HIS LAST
   QUESTION THAT I WAS WRONG.
          - OKAY. LEO.
    - I'M GONNA SAY THE PARK

    RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET
      FROM OUR APARTMENT.
           - CARRISA.
 CARRISA SAID THE PIZZA PARLOR.
    - 'CAUSE YOU LOVE PIZZA.

     - THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
          NUMBER TWO.
            - YEAH.
    - AFTER--AFTER THE PARK,
    WE'D GO GET SOME PIZZA.

         - OKAY. AARON.
        - PROBABLY, UM,
     LIKE, A BASEBALL GAME
      OR A FOOTBALL GAME.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     - AN ARENA, BASICALLY.

            - OKAY.
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, ASHLEY?
   - WELL, THERE'S NO ARENAS
      IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
           - THE BAR.
           - THE BAR?

     I DON'T GO TO THE BAR.
     - YOU GO WITH RYAN...
  - NO, I--THAT WAS ONE TIME.
      - AND YOUR FRIENDS.
         OH, WHATEVER.
        - AHH, GOT YOU.

      ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.
 LEO AND CARRISA, YOU GUYS ARE
 IN FIRST PLACE WITH 25 POINTS.
    STICK AROUND, OUR FINAL
  BONUS QUESTION IS COMING UP,

        AND IT IS WORTH
        UP TO 30 POINTS.
         DON'T GO AWAY.
