  IT'S WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
      ARE YOU GUYS READY?
             - YES.
         - HERE WE GO.

  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
     BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,
 THE ONE WHO WOULD LOOK BETTER
      IN A SLEEVELESS TANK
          IS "BLANK,"

      AND IN SHORT SHORTS,
      IT WOULD BE "BLANK."
             AARON.
  - ASHLEY WOULD HAVE TO LOOK
  BETTER IN A SLEEVELESS TANK,

 AND THEN I WOULD HAVE TO LOOK
    BETTER IN SHORT SHORTS.
         I DON'T KNOW.
     [laughs] I DON'T KNOW.
           OHH, BOY.

      I'M WRONG, AREN'T I?
            - OKAY.
 WELL, ASHLEY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - I SAID ME AND ME.
  - ASHLEY SAID SHE WOULD LOOK
        GREAT IN A TANK

    AND SHE WOULD LOOK GREAT
      IN THE SHORT SHORTS.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    - SO YOU'RE IN THE LEAD
       RIGHT NOW, AARON,

      BUT WHEN YOU DO PUT
     THOSE SHORT SHORTS ON,
  COULD YOU SEND ME A PICTURE?
           - I WILL.
     - IT MIGHT BLIND YOU.
        - I'D LOVE THAT.

- I JUST NEED YOUR EMAIL, SO...
          - REINALDO.
    - I HOPE SHE SAID ME...
            - OKAY.
   - IN THE--ON THE T-SHIRT,

    AND THEN SHORT SHORTS--
   I WOULDN'T BE CAUGHT DEAD
        IN SHORT SHORTS,
    SO IT'D HAVE TO BE HER.
          - ALL RIGHT,
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, BARBARA?

          - ME AND ME.
  - BARBARA SAID HER AND HER.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
   - WHEN DO YOU EVER WEAR--
          - IN SUMMER.

        - NEVER, NEVER.
     - SO AARON AND ASHLEY,
       YOU'RE STILL TIED
   WITH REINALDO AND BARBARA.

  LEO, WE'RE GONNA GO TO YOU.
      YOU ONLY HAVE TO GET
    ONE ANSWER RIGHT TO WIN.
   - OKAY, WELL, SHE'S ALWAYS
     SQUEEZING MY BICEPS...

            - OKAY.
  - UM, SO I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
     ME FOR THE FIRST ONE,
        AND THEN WE HAVE
     A PICTURE OF ME WITH--

     I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D
    CALL THEM SHORT SHORTS,
         FROM WAY BACK.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    - SO THAT WOULD PROBABLY
      HAVE TO BE ME ALSO.

   - WHAT'D YOU SAY, CARRISA?
       - CONCEITED MUCH?
      - CARRISA SAID YOU,
   AND SHE WOULD LOOK BETTER
      IN THE SHORT SHORTS,

    BUT YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.

   WE WILL GET RIGHT INTO IT.
       IF YOU COULD PICK
        ONE SEXUAL ROLE

   FOR YOUR WIFE TO PLAY OUT,
   IT WOULD BE NAUGHTY NURSE,
      NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL,

     OR NAUGHTY LIBRARIAN?
            CARLYLE.
   - UM, I GUESS I WOULD HAVE
          TO SAY, UH,

  PROBABLY NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.
     - NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.
- YOU KNOW, NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL,
      CAUSE I VE ALWAYS HAD
         A THING FOR--

       WELL, SHE WENT TO
CATHOLIC SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING,
    SO I ALWAYS HAD A THING
  FOR THOSE CATHOLIC SCHOOL...
  - THE WHOLE GUILTY PLEASURE
         KIND OF THING.

       - YES. ABSOLUTELY.
       - ALL RIGHT. MIKE?
     - I M GONNA HAVE TO GO
    WITH, UH, NAUGHTY NURSE.
       SHE S, UH, ALWAYS
       TAKING CARE OF ME,

 AND THERE S NOTHING NAUGHTIER
THAN A NURSE TAKING CARE OF YOU.
     - I WOULD SAY THE, UH,
      NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.
   - THE NAUGHTY SCHOOLGIRL.

  - SHE S A LITTLE BIT YOUNGER
            THAN ME,
       SO I THINK WE CAN
       JUST GO WITH THAT.
            - OKAY.
   NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS--

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
  I WISH A COP WOULD HAVE BEEN
       THERE TO REMIND ME
 OF MY RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.

  THEN I NEVER WOULD HAVE TOLD
         MY WIFE BLANK.
           - [laughs]
            - MIKE?
     - UM, ONCE, ONLY ONCE,

I MADE A MISTAKE OF TELLING HER
     TO CHANGE HER CLOTHES,
    BECAUSE SHE DIDN T LOOK
       VERY NICE IN THEM.
             - OH.
     - ONCE, SHERRI, ONCE.

    - YOU TOLD ONE HER TIME.
  - THAT S THE ONLY--ONLY ONE.
       - AND YOU LEARNED.
         - YES, MA AM.
  - SO IF SHE WEARS SOMETHING
      THAT YOU DON T LIKE,

        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
 -  YOU LOOK WONDERFUL, HONEY.
          - AH. DAVID?
             - HMM.

 I-I GUESS I D HAVE TO SAY, UM,
          TO PUT DOWN
    THE FRENCH FRIES MAYBE,
         CAUSE I THOUGHT
    SHE WAS STARTING TO GAIN

      A COUPLE OF POUNDS.
             - OOH.
           - [laughs]
        - OKAY. CARLYLE?

- I-I GUESS IT WOULD BE, FOR ME,
    UH, WHEN I TOLD HER THAT
SHE DIDN T NEED TO LOSE WEIGHT,
  ONLY BECAUSE SHE, YOU KNOW,
 SHE S VERY HEALTH CONSCIOUS...

           - MM-HMM.
   - AND--AND, YOU KNOW, SHE,
      YOU KNOW, SHE THINKS
      A LOT OF HER FIGURE,
    AND SO SHE THOUGHT THAT
I WAS TELLING THAT IT WAS OKAY.

     YOU KNOW, I DON T CARE
         HOW SHE LOOKS.
         AND SHE WASN T
  TOO HAPPY ABOUT THAT, SO...
   - OKAY. THIS IS OUR FINAL
      QUESTION, HUSBANDS.

    ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS,
      WHAT S THE ONE PART
      OF YOUR WIFE S BODY
   YOU PAY MORE ATTENTION TO
        THAN THE OTHERS?

THAT SHE HAS VERY SENSUOUS LIPS
         AND EVERYTHING
         AND JUST THAT,
     YOU KNOW, THAT S WHAT
    I WOULD PAY ATTENTION TO
      BESIDES THE OBVIOUS.

            - MIKE?
    - NOT THE OBVIOUS, HUH?
       - NOT THE OBVIOUS.
        - UH, HER FACE.
          - HER FACE.

     - YEAH, JUST HER FACE.
I THINK SHE S A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
 AND EVERY TIME I LOOK AT HER,
      I JUST FALL IN LOVE.

 I DEFINITELY THINK THAT THAT S
   WHAT HE WOULD WANT TO SEE.
         - OKAY. MIKE?
        - ALMOST RIGHT.
        - NAUGHTY NURSE.

     COULD STILL BE THERE.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
  I WISH A COP WOULD HAVE BEEN
       THERE TO REMIND ME
 OF MY RIGHT TO REMAIN SILENT.

  THEN I NEVER WOULD HAVE TOLD
         MY WIFE BLANK.
             IRENE?
     - ABOUT A FIRST WIFE.

  - HE DIDN T WANT ME TO KNOW.
             - MM.
 - OKAY. WHAT D YOU SAY, MIKE?
    - I ASKED HER TO CHANGE
     HER CLOTHES ONE TIME.

       - WHEN HE TOLD YOU
    TO CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.
     DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?
         - YEAH, IT...
  - BECAUSE I DON T LIKE WHEN
  YOU DON T LIKE WHAT I WEAR?

            - RIGHT.
- WHAT HAPPENED WHEN HE TOLD YOU
    TO CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES?
   - WELL, I GOT MAD AT HIM.
            - YEAH.

   - BUT HE SHOULD--IT SHOULD
   ALWAYS BE THAT I M RIGHT,
        AND YOU KNOW...
         - ABSOLUTELY.
 - NEVER SAY ANYTHING NEGATIVE.
      - I TOLD YOU, ONCE.

     IT ONLY HAPPENED ONCE.
       - HE DID IT ONCE.
  AND HE KEPT SAYING, HE KNOWS
  EXACTLY WHERE HE WENT WRONG.
 - I GUESS HE S A FAST LEARNER.
  - YEP, HE SURE IS. LINDSAY?

 - THAT HE WANTED A THREESOME?
         I DON T KNOW.
     I DON T KNOW WHAT TO--
     I DON T KNOW WHAT SAY.
           - [laughs]
    - [laughs] I DON T KNOW.

     - HOW DO YOU SAY THAT?
  - WELL, I DON T KNOW. I FEEL
 LIKE MAYBE HE BROUGHT THAT UP.
           - [laughs]

 - YOU FEEL LIKE IT, OR HE DID?
  LIKE, WAS HE LIKE,  HONEY, I
LIKE PANCAKES WITH SOME SAUSAGE.
   CAN WE HAVE A THREESOME?
           I MEAN...

           - NO, NO.
            [laughs]
 - KIND OF WHAT--WHAT DID HE--
      WHEN--WHAT HAPPENED?
           - [laughs]
     I DON'T--I DON T KNOW.

- OKAY, WELL, NOW WHAT HAPPENED?
         DID IT HAPPEN?
           [laughter]
- OH. ALL RIGHT, MUM S THE WORD.

      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - SO, DAVID, DID YOU ASK
        FOR A THREESOME?
        - UM, WE STARTED
       DIETING LATELY...

     - OH, I WAS GONNA SAY.
      - SO I YELLED AT HER
 TO PUT DOWN THE FRENCH FRIES.
  - PUT DOWN THE FRENCH FRIES.
    - I WAS GONNA SAY THAT,

  BUT I DIDN T THINK YOU WOULD
   SAY THAT ON TV. ALL RIGHT.
   - SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW,
          DID HE SAY,
     PUT DOWN THE FRENCH FRY
  AND LET S HAVE A THREESOME ?

           - [laughs]
    - ALL RIGHT, BERNADETTE?
   - THAT HE WANTED TO DO IT
       IN A PUBLIC PLACE.
 - AND WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?

     - WELL, WE DID KIND OF
         DO THAT ONCE.
- YOU DID KIND OF DO THAT ONCE.
            - ONCE.
    - WHERE WAS THAT PLACE?
  - AT OUR WEDDING RECEPTION.

            - OKAY.
   CARLYLE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
         - OKAY, I SAID
    THE TIME THAT I TOLD YOU
      THAT YOU DIDN T NEED
       TO LOSE WEIGHT...

             - OH.
- AND YOU WERE ALL LIKE,  WHAT?
YOU RE HAPPY WITH ME LIKE THIS?
     - I WAS LIKE,  YEAH.

   AND YOU THOUGHT THAT MEANT
   THAT I DIDN T REALLY CARE
    OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
  - YEAH, I GUESS THAT S TRUE.

       - LADIES, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
    ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS,
WHAT S THE ONE PART OF YOUR BODY
       YOUR HUSBAND SAID

   HE PAYS MORE ATTENTION TO
        THAN THE OTHERS?
            LINDSAY?
        - MAYBE MY HAIR,
  CAUSE HE ALWAYS SAYS THAT HE
WANTS ME TO WEAR MY HAIR DOWN...

          - ALL RIGHT.
     DAVID, WHAT D YOU SAY?
    -  CAUSE IT LOOKS NICE.
         I DON T KNOW.
      - I SAID SHOULDERS,

    CAUSE I LIKE THE FRECKLES
       ON HER SHOULDERS.
 - FRECKLES ON YOUR SHOULDERS.
 - OH, OKAY. THAT S A GOOD ONE.
     ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.
      - YEAH. BERNADETTE?

             - AW.
          - IT S OKAY.
           - [laughs]

  - AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, IRENE?

  MY FACE, AND HE SAYS THAT...
    - SO HOW DOES HE SAY IT?

        DOES HE JUST GO,
    HONEY, I LIKE YOUR FACE ?
           - [laughs]
         I DON T KNOW.
        WELL, YOU KNOW,

 DURING SEX, THE CRAZIEST THING
   I HAVE EVER BEEN ON TOP OF
           WAS BLANK.

          BERNADETTE?
     - THE BACK OF A SOFA.
 - WAS IT A CRAZY KIND OF SOFA?

     - NO, IT WAS A REGULAR
         KIND OF SOFA,
BUT YOU KNOW, BEING ON THAT PART
       MADE IT DIFFERENT.
- ON THE BACK OF IT, ALL RIGHT.
        - YEAH. [laughs]

            - IRENE?
        - I M GONNA SAY
      THE KITCHEN COUNTER.
       - KITCHEN COUNTER.

    - AND I SAY THAT BECAUSE
  ALTHOUGH IT S NOT SO CRAZY,
       WE RE FOOD PEOPLE,
   AND WE ALWAYS LIKE TO EAT,
     SO TO PUT YOUR BODIES
     ON WHERE YOUR FOOD IS,

     THAT S A LITTLE IFFY.
  - YEAH, YOU GUYS ARE KIND OF
 DOING A  9 1/2 WEEKS  KIND OF
  WITH ALL THE FOOD GOING ON.

            - YEAH.
     - ALL RIGHT. LINDSAY?
     - ON THE COUCH. YEAH.
         - ON THE COUCH
    WAS THE CRAZIEST PLACE?

    - IT S NOT THE CRAZIEST.
 - YOU GUYS ARE A CRAZY BUNCH,
         I GOT TO SAY.
       - I M GONNA SAY--
    I M GONNA SAY THE COUCH.

       - LADIES, THIS IS
       HE NEXT QUESTION.
     IF YOUR HUSBAND HAD $1
 FOR EVERY TIME YOU TURNED DOWN
HIS ADVANCES IN THE LAST MONTH,

 HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD HE HAVE?
             IRENE?
       - OH, GOSH, A LOT.
           - [laughs]

       - JUST HAD A BABY,
      SO I HAVE AN EXCUSE.
    - OKAY. HOW IS THE BABY?
        CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU. SHE S--SHE S GREAT.
           [applause]

             - YES.
      - SO I M GONNA SAY,
         UH, 100 BUCKS.
        - OKAY. LINDSAY?

             - $1.
- YEAH, ONLY ONE TIME, I THINK.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
     - SO HE S VERY HAPPY.

        - [laughs] YEP.
         - BERNADETTE?
  - I THINK HE S BE BROKE. $0.
             - $0.
            - YEAH.

    - ALL RIGHT, SO CARLYLE
    IS A HAPPY MAN AS WELL.
       - LUCKY. [laughs]
    - ALL RIGHT. I LOVE IT.
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.

       DOES YOUR HUSBAND
     SQUEEZE THE TOOTHPASTE
 FROM THE BOTTOM, FROM THE TOP,
 OR FROM SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN?

            LINDSAY?
    - HE ALWAYS SQUEEZES IT
        FROM THE MIDDLE,
 AND IT DRIVES ME CRAZY,  CAUSE
   I LIKE IT FROM THE BOTTOM.

THAT WAY YOU GET ALL THE STUFF.
        SO I M GONNA SAY
     FROM--FROM THE MIDDLE.
     SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN.
 - SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN. OKAY.

          BERNADETTE?
     - I THINK IT WOULD BE
          THE BOTTOM.
       CAUSE WE--YOU KNOW,
    MY SONS ARE THERE, TOO,

        SO I DON T KNOW
WHO S SQUEEZING WHERE. [laughs]
   - IT S JUST BEEN SQUEEZED.
- BUT I NOTICE THAT IT S ALWAYS
      RIGHT AT THE BOTTOM,

SO I LL HAVE TO SAY THE BOTTOM.
         - OKAY. IRENE?
         - HANDS DOWN,
     DEFINITELY THE BOTTOM,

       CAUSE IF I SQUEEZE
 ANYWHERE ELSE, HE GETS ANGRY.
  SO WE EVEN HAVE ONE OF THOSE
 LITTLE THINGS THAT YOU PUT ON.
   - OH, THE SQUEEGEE THINGS?
             - YES.

TO MAKE SURE THAT I M CONSTANTLY
   SQUEEZING FROM THE BOTTOM.
  I CANNOT DEVIATE FROM THAT.
     - WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT?
        WAS THAT MIKE S?

  - WELL, I BOUGHT IT SO THAT
   HE WOULDN T GET MAD AT ME.
           - [laughs]
- SO DEFINITELY FROM THE BOTTOM.
      - ALL RIGHT. GOT IT.
LADIES, HERE S A BONUS QUESTION.

   IT HAS 2 PARTS. EACH PART
IS WORTH 15 POINTS. HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
 THE BEST THING ABOUT TRAVELING
   WITH MY HUSBAND IS BLANK,

  AND THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING
           IS BLANK.
          BERNADETTE?
    - I GUESS THE BEST THING
     IS THAT, I DON T KNOW,

          IT'S USUALLY
     SOMETHING SPONTANEOUS,
   SO THE SPONTANEITY OF IT,
     YOU KNOW, SPONTANEOUS.
      AND THE WORST THING
  MIGHT ALSO BE THE SAME THING

    BECAUSE THEN IT S LIKE,
   WELL, WE NEED TO GET THIS
       OR THAT, YOU KNOW.
        - SO SPONTANEITY
      AND THE SPONTANEITY.

     - AND THEN, YEAH, THEN
   SOMETIMES IT DOESN T WORK,
  BECAUSE THEN YOU DON T HAVE
   WHAT YOU NEED OR WHATEVER.
         - OKAY. IRENE?

  - HE S DEFINITELY EFFICIENT
           AND FAST.
       HE TRAVELS A LOT,
  SO HE KNOWS WHAT HE S DOING.
    AND SAME WAY THAT S ALSO
      THE NEGATIVE THING,

BECAUSE I FIND MYSELF RUNNING TO
KEEP UP WITH HIM IN THE AIRPORT.
         - WE NEED ONE.
          - EFFICIENT.
- EFFICIENT. NOW THE SECOND ONE,
      THE ABSOLUTE WORST.

     - I LL SAY FAST, YEAH.
            - FAST.
   OKAY. EFFICIENT AND FAST.
       GOT YOU. LINDSAY?
       - THE WORST THING
    IS THAT HE S IMPATIENT.

      HE ALWAYS IS SAYING,
        ARE WE THERE YET?
  WHEN ARE WE GONNA BE THERE?
           YOU KNOW.
 HE S ALWAYS LOOKING AT THE GPS
             TO SEE

 WHAT OUR ARRIVAL TIME WILL BE.
            - YEAH.
    - UM, BUT THE BEST THING
    IS THAT HE PACKS LIGHT,
    SO WE USUALLY ONLY NEED
      ONE SUITCASE, SO...

   - OKAY. THANK YOU, LADIES.
   WHEN WE RETURN, WE LL SEE
  JUST HOW WELL THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

     THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
  <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i> GOOD NIGHT.

  YOU KNOW, THE MOST NOTORIOUS
       BIGAMIST ON RECORD
    WAS MARRIED TO 104 WOMEN
       AT THE SAME TIME.
AND YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD PROBLEMS
 REMEMBERING YOUR ANNIVERSARY.

 HERE ARE TONIGHT'S NEWLYWEDS!
       SHE'S FROM LATVIA,
   AND HE'S FROM CALIFORNIA,
  BUT THEY BOTH SHARE SIMILAR
       PORPOISES IN LIFE.

    MEET MATTHEW AND INESE.
    THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS
         SAY THEY LOOK
    LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER,

    HMM, I DON'T THINK THAT
   KIND OF MARRIAGE IS LEGAL.
   WELCOME KOREY AND LAQUITA.
      AND OUR FINAL COUPLE
 WAS SO EXCITED TO GET MARRIED

  THAT SHE JUST COULDN'T WAIT
          TO BANG HIM.
     HERE ARE JOHN AND LIZ.
 LET'S PLAY <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>

  Captioning provided by GSN.
             - HI!

        HI, AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
  FELLAS, HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?
    - HOW YOU DOING, SHERRI?
          - I'M GOOD.
       SO WE'RE STARTING.

    WE HAVE SENT YOUR WIVES
           BACKSTAGE
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
SO WE'RE GONNA GET RIGHT TO IT.
     ARE YOU READY, FELLAS?

          - LET'S GO.
            - OKAY.
  WHAT DOES YOUR WIFE WORK OUT
         THE HARDEST--
       HER ARMS, HER ABS,
       HER LEGS, OR YOU?

            MATTHEW?
  - I MEAN, IT'S PRETTY EASY,
   SHE WORKS OUT ME THE MOST.
 - SHE WORKS YOU OUT THE MOST.
            - YEAH.

            - OKAY.
    - I DO ALL THE COOKING,
   THE CLEANING--EVERYTHING.
        - OH, THAT'S HOW
    SHE WORKS YOU OUT, HUH?

            - YEAH.
         - OKAY. KOREY?
   - I MIGHT HAVE TO GO WITH
       SHE WORKS ME OUT.
      - SHE WORKS YOU OUT.
   - YEAH, SHE WORKS ME OUT.

            - OKAY.
  - SHE WORKS ME OUT THE MOST.
    - JOHN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - SHERRI, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
WITH SHE WORKS ME OUT THE MOST.

      - SHE WORKS YOU OUT
       THE MOST AS WELL.
   - IT'S BEEN A LITTLE WHILE
  SINCE WE'VE GONE TO THE GYM,
 SO I'D HAVE TO GO WITH MYSELF.
- OKAY. HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
     SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
    AN OVERWORKED BARTENDER
WHEN I HAVE TO LISTEN TO MY WIFE

     YAMMER ON ABOUT BLANK.
             KOREY?
       - I'D LIKE TO SAY

      JUST ABOUT ME BEING
         MORE ROMANTIC.
            - OKAY.
- YOU KNOW, WALK ON THE BEACH--
 AND I MEAN, THAT'S FINE, BUT I
NEED TO STEP IT UP IN THAT AREA.

        - YEAH, SO WHAT
      WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO
         AS OPPOSED TO
     WALKING ON THE BEACH?
     - YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,
         CAVEMAN STYLE,

    YOU KNOW, JUST BE ROUGH
   AND AGGRESSIVE, YOU KNOW?
            - JOHN?
        - ALL THOSE, UH,
    A LOT OF REALITY SHOWS.

   SHE'S ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT
    <i>THE REAL HOUSEWIVES</i> SHOWS
     AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
  - YEAH, ALL RIGHT. MATTHEW?
      - SHE--SHE NEVER HAS
        ENOUGH CLOTHES.

        SHE ALWAYS SAYS,
      "I NEED NEW JEANS,"
    OR, "I NEED NEW SHOES,"
   OR, "I NEED A NEW SHIRT,"
         BUT I'M LIKE,
  "HEY, YOU LOOK BEST NAKED,"

   SO LET'S KEEP IT THAT WAY.
    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
     WHAT'S THE LAST MOVIE
   YOU WATCHED WITH YOUR WIFE

         THAT MADE YOU
    A LITTLE BIT MISTY-EYED?
             JOHN?
    - I HAVE TO GO WITH, UM,
    THE MOVIE <i>THE FOUNTAIN.</i>

        -  <i>THE FOUNTAIN? </i>
       <i>- YEAH, I REALLY--</i>
   - OKAY, YOU GOT A LITTLE--
        - I REALLY DID.
            - YEAH.
     - IT WAS OVERWHELMING.

     - ALL RIGHT. MATTHEW?
          - UM, IT WAS
      <i>SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.</i>
           [laughter]

      - EXACTLY WHICH PART
    OF   <i>SILENCE OF THE LAMBS</i>
      GOT YOU MISTY-EYED?
        WAS IT THE PART
  WHERE THEY ATE HIS FACE UP?

    - I DON'T--I DON'T KNOW,
        IT JUST KIND OF
      TOUCHED ME IN A WAY.
   - HANNIBAL LECTER GOT YOU
   A LITTLE MISTY-EYED, HUH?

  - YEAH, A LITTLE BIT. YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT, KOREY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - UH, IT WAS A 9/11 MOVIE,
        IT WAS KINDA...

            - OKAY.
   - IT WAS KIND OF TOUCHING.
       - DO YOU REMEMBER
        THE NAME OF IT?
   - WAS IT <i>FAHRENHEIT 9/11? </i>
<i>-</i>  <i>FAHRENHEIT 9/11,</i>THAT WAS IT.

    - YEAH, <i>FAHRENHEIT 9/11.</i>
<i>YEAH, THAT WAS IT. THAT WAS IT.</i>

 SO WERE YOU SITTING BACK THERE
    KIND OF IN ANTICIPATION,

      TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
  WHAT YOUR HUSBAND HAS SAID?
          - OH, YEAH.
           - OH, OH.
   WELL, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

             - OH.
           - COME ON.
    - ALL RIGHT, SHE'S LIKE,

        I KNEW THAT ONE.
     - TIME TO GO TO WORK.

     - YEAH, AND WHAT ABOUT
         YOU, LAQUITA?
     - IT WOULD DEFINITELY
        HAVE TO BE HIM.
         - OKAY. KOREY?

        KOREY SAID HIM.
       - GOOD JOB, BABE.
         - MM-HMM. LIZ?

  - NOT TO COPY EVERYONE ELSE,
     BUT I HAVE TO SAY HIM.
  - YOU'RE GONNA SAY HIM. ALL
 RIGHT, JOHN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
         JOHN SAID ME.
             - YAY!

              YAY.
            - OKAY.
  LADIES, HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
     SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE
    AN OVERWORKED BARTENDER
     WHEN I HAVE TO LISTEN
           TO MY WIFE

     YAMMER ON ABOUT BLANK.
            LAQUITA?
       - MAYBE MY FAMILY.

     - YOU YAMMER ON ABOUT
       YOUR FAMILY A LOT?
             - YES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    KOREY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

      KOREY SAID ABOUT HIM
      BEING MORE ROMANTIC.
            - YEAH.
    - OH! YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
       - ALL RIGHT, LIZ?

       - UM, GOD, I MEAN,
 IT'S BEEN SOMETHING NEW, BUT I
WOULD SAY ABOUT TAKING THE F.E.
       - TAKING THE F.E.?

     - IT'S A TEST YOU HAVE
    TO TAKE FOR ENGINEERING.
        - OH, SO A TEST.
  - IT'S AN ENGINEERING TEST.
 MY FATHER'S BEEN ON TOP OF HIM
   EVERY SINGLE DAY ABOUT IT,

       AND, UH, I-I THINK
        THAT'S PROBABLY
         WHAT I'VE BEEN
    BUGGING HIM MOST ABOUT.
            - OKAY.
    JOHN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

 ABOUT THOSE REALITY TV SHOWS.
    - INESE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - I ALWAYS, LIKE,
     ASK FOR MORE MASSAGES.
   THERE'S JUST NEVER ENOUGH
       FOR ME, YOU KNOW--
           - I KNOW.
        - I KINDA LIKE--

    - WHAT KIND OF MASSAGES
          DO YOU LIKE?
       - JUST EVERY KIND.
         - EVERYTHING.
- AS LONG AS IT'S A MASSAGE, AND
 AS LONG AS HE'S MASSAGING ME.

        - IT'S ALL GOOD.
  ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
            CLOTHES.
       - I SAID CLOTHES.
             - OH.

        - YOU ALWAYS SAY
     YOU NEED MORE CLOTHES.
       - WELL, EVERY GIRL
      NEEDS MORE CLOTHES.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
  THIS IS THE FINAL QUESTION.

   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
       WAS THE LAST MOVIE
      HE WATCHED WITH YOU
   THAT MADE HIM A LITTLE BIT
        MISTY-EYED. LIZ?

- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE LAST
     THING THAT WE WATCHED,
       BUT I KNOW <i>CLICK </i>
       <i>MAKES HIM TEAR UP,</i>
  SO, UH, THAT--THAT REALLY--
      - <i>CLICK,</i> THE COMEDY?

     - NO--THE--WELL, YEAH,
     IT'S KIND OF A COMEDY.
THE ONE WITH ADAM SANDLER IN IT.
     - WITH ADAM SANDLER--
     ADAM SANDLER, RIGHT--
   - YEAH, 'CAUSE AT THE END,

   YOU KNOW, HE'S LOST HIS--
            - YEAH.

        WITH HIS FAMILY,
 AND SO, YEAH, THAT'S AT LEAST
  THE LAST ONE WE SAW TOGETHER

         WHERE HE GOT--
            - OKAY.
     - THAT I CAN THINK OF.
      - ALL RIGHT. <i>CLICK.</i>
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, JOHN?

    JOHN SAID <i>THE FOUNTAIN. </i>
 <i>- I DIDN'T SEE THAT WITH YOU.</i>
   YOU WATCHED IT BY YOURSELF
       AND THEN TEXTED ME
     THAT YOU WERE SO SAD.
    I WASN'T THERE FOR THAT.

      - I TRIED. THAT WAS
      THE BEST I COULD DO.
 - HE WAS WATCHING--HE WATCHES
  SAD MOVIES BY HIMSELF, SO...
   - YOU REMEMBER YOU WATCHED
  THAT ONE BY YOURSELF, JOHN?

         - YEAH. YEAH.
            - OKAY.
 INESE, WHAT--WHAT DO YOU SAY?
       - UM, IT HAS TO BE
      <i>SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.</i>

         EVEN--IT'S NOT
        REALLY ROMANTIC,
       BUT I HAVE TO SAY,
 WHEN THAT SERIAL KILLER, LIKE,
        HAD THAT MOMENT
      WITH THE FBI AGENT,

 IT WAS REALLY ROMANTIC, RIGHT?
            - WHAT?!
- LIKE, CHOKE HOLDING ONTO HIM,
AND, LIKE, WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN?

      - AND YOU--DID YOU--
  YOU GOT EMOTIONAL TOGETHER?
            - YEAH.

       - YEAH, SO SWEET.

              TOO.
           - LAQUITA.
     - HE, UH, HAS A SHORT
       ATTENTION SPAN...

            - OKAY.
     - FOR ROMANTIC MOVIES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
 - BUT I WOULD HAVE TO PROBABLY
  SAY, <i>WHY DID I GET MARRIED?</i>

    -  <i>WHY DID I GET MARRIED?</i>
      TYLER PERRY'S MOVIE
      <i>WHY DID I GET MARRIED?</i>
             - YES.

             - UM.
   - HE SAID <i>FAHRENHEIT 9/11.</i>
   - I DIDN'T EVEN WATCH THAT
           WITH YOU.
      - NO, I THOUGHT THAT
   WAS THE NAME OF THE MOVIE.

  THE MOVIE WE SEEN YESTERDAY.
       - I'VE NEVER EVEN
        SEEN THAT MOVIE.
  - IT WAS, LIKE, TWO DAYS AGO
  WE WATCHED IT ON TELEVISION.

    - WE NEVER--WRONG GIRL.
         - OH, WHOOPS.

          - OH, YEAH.
    - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
LADIES, COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
      IF MY HUSBAND PLAYED
       IN A SPORTS LEAGUE

  AND THE NUMBER ON HIS JERSEY
          REPRESENTED
 THE TRUE SIZE OF HIS MANHOOD,
  HE WOULD WEAR NUMBER BLANK.

             INESE?
      - I WILL GO WITH 10.
     - WITH 10? ALL RIGHT.

 - YEAH, YOU KNOW, IT'S A GOOD
 ROUND NUMBER, LIKE, YOU KNOW--
          - ALL RIGHT.
      - SUMS IT UP THERE.
       - THAT SUMS IT UP,
         IT SURE DOES.

    - YEAH, I THINK IT'S 10.
     - ALL RIGHT. LAQUITA?
       - I WOULD SAY 42.

            - A 40--
- WAIT, THERE'S AN EXPLANATION.
            - OKAY.
    - HE ACTUALLY PLAYS, UM,
       SEMIPRO FOOTBALL,

     AND THAT'S HIS NUMBER,
  AND PLUS, IT'S A BIG NUMBER.
     - DOES THAT REPRESENT
 THE TRUE SIZE OF HIS MANHOOD?
             - YES.
             - OH.

           [laughter]
     - WHAT ABOUT YOU, LIZ?
         - OH, GOD, UH,
     I DON'T KNOW ABOUT 42,

  BUT, UH, I'M GONNA GO WITH,
             UH...
          I THINK--7.

     - 7, OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.
IN COMEDY, TIMING IS EVERYTHING,

  SO WHEN IS THE WORST TIME TO
 JOKE AROUND WITH YOUR HUSBAND?
            LAQUITA?
 - WHEN HE'S PLAYING FOOTBALL.
          - OKAY. LIZ?

   - WHEN WE'VE HAD A FIGHT.
HE--I CAN'T TAKE HIM SERIOUS IF
 HE'S MAD AT ME ABOUT ANYTHING,
 AND I ALWAYS THINK HE'S JOKING
  IF HE'S ACTUALLY MAD AT ME.

        - OKAY, SO AFTER
      YOU'VE HAD A FIGHT.
            - YEAH.
         - OKAY. INESE?
     - I HAVE TO SAY, LIKE,
       WHEN HE'S WORKING,

  BECAUSE HE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER,
  AND HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME
        ON HIS COMPUTER,
       AND IF I'M TRYING
    TO JUST, LIKE, NAG HIM,

 AND, LIKE, TRY TO, LIKE, JOKE,
      AND HE'S JUST LIKE,
  "I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE,"
     YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE...
        - SO IT'S THEN.
            - YEAH.

 - OKAY. LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.
   WHEN IT COMES TO SEXTING,
         WOULD YOU SAY
  YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO DO IT,
   YOUR HUSBAND'S MORE LIKELY
           TO DO IT,

     OR NEITHER OF YOU HAVE
THAT TYPE OF CELL SERVICE? LIZ?
      - UM, I'M GONNA SAY
         NEITHER OF US,
          BECAUSE WE--

  WE TYPICALLY DON'T SEND EACH
 OTHER TEXT MESSAGES LIKE THAT,
JUST IN PERSON, YOU KNOW, SO...
  - OKAY, YOU DO IT IN PERSON.
            - YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT. INESE?

   - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY HIM,
  BUT I'LL DEFINITELY RESPOND.
     - ALL RIGHT. LAQUITA?
        - DEFINITELY ME.
       I'M THE INITIATOR.

            - YEAH?
          - OH, YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
LADIES, HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
   IT HAS 2 PARTS. EACH PART
IS WORTH 15 POINTS. HERE WE GO.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
       WHEN WE WERE FIRST
  GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER,
  I THOUGHT MY HUSBAND'S BLANK
    WOULD BE A DEAL BREAKER,

       BUT THEN HIS BLANK
   SEALED THE DEAL FOR LIFE.
             INESE?
       - A DEAL BREAKER?
       PROBABLY HIS HAIR.

  IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE CRAZY
          AT TIMES...
           - UH-HUH.
  - I DIDN'T LIKE IT TOO MUCH.
     I USUALLY LIKE, LIKE,
  SHAVED HEADS BETTER ANYWAY,

 SO HIS HAIR, BUT THEN HIS ABS
  DEFINITELY SEALED THE DEAL.
          LIKE, ONCE--
       - THEY SEALED IT.
 - ONCE I SAW THE RIPPED ABS...
            - OKAY.

    - YEAH, I WAS FINE WITH
   THE HAIR, AND I STILL AM.
       AS LONG AS HIS ABS
    LOOK AS NICE AS THEY DO.
           - GOT YOU.
       - SO TOTALLY FINE.

           - LAQUITA?
- PROBABLY HAVE TO BE HIS EYES,
   AND THEN HIS PERSONALITY.

     - AND HIS PERSONALITY?
             - YES.
          - OKAY. LIZ?
  - UM, DEFINITELY HIS STYLE--

 THAT DEFINITELY COULD'VE BEEN
        A DEAL BREAKER.
    WHEN I MET HIM, HE HAD,
   LIKE, A MOUNTAIN MAN BEARD
 AND BRACES, AND HE HAD, LIKE,
      CLOTHES FROM, LIKE,

         I DON'T KNOW,
  MIDDLE SCHOOL OR SOMETHING.
         AND THIS WAS--
    AND THIS WAS IN COLLEGE,
      WHEN I WAS A JUNIOR
          IN COLLEGE,

     AND, UH, THIS WAS NOT
      A GOOD LOOK AT ALL,
 BUT DEFINITELY--IT--YOU KNOW,
  GAVE HIM A LITTLE MAKEOVER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    - AND HIS PERSONALITY...

       - HIS PERSONALITY.
   - DEFINITELY WON ME OVER.
          ABSOLUTELY.
            - OKAY.
  LADIES, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

        WE'RE GONNA SEE

   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.
          HERE WE GO.

       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
      IF MY HUSBAND PLAYED
       IN A SPORTS LEAGUE
  AND THE NUMBER ON HIS JERSEY
          REPRESENTED

         THE TRUE SIZE
        OF HIS MANHOOD,
  HE WOULD WEAR NUMBER BLANK.
            MATTHEW?

     - I GUESS SHE'LL--100.
           [laughter]
- YOU ARE VERY, VERY CONFIDENT,
            YOU ARE.

           WHOO-WHEE.
    INESE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
         INESE SAID 10.
  - THAT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

    - THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.
      - ALL RIGHT, KOREY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - UH, SO WE GOING BY--
           NOT THE...

      SEE, I MEAN, IT'S--
        YOU KNOW, IT...
  - YOU DON'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
   ANYTHING TO ME. I GOT YOU.

    - LET ME SEE--OH, UH...
      OH, BOY, HERE WE GO.
             UH, 7?

           - 7. OKAY.
      SO THAT'S--YOU THINK
   THAT'S WHAT LAQUITA SAID?
     - YEAH, YEAH, SHE--7.

   YEAH, SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT,
          YEAH, YEAH.
  - LAQUITA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
         LAQUITA SAID--
          - I GUESS HE
    UNDERESTIMATED HIS SELF.

       - LAQUITA SAID 42.
           - WHY 42?
  - I MEAN, BUT WE'RE TALKING
    ABOUT THE SIZE OF OUR--
   - LET'S PUT IT TOGETHER--
            WHY 42?

       - YOU KNOW, 42...
           [laughter]
          - I MEAN...

      - LEG UP LIKE THIS.
       THAT WOULD BE 42?
     I MEAN, BUT THANK YOU
      FOR THE COMPLIMENT.

 - YEAH, KOREY, YOU AND MATTHEW
     GOT BIG PANTS TO FILL,
    THAT'S ALL I GOTTA SAY.
       - YEAH, YOU KNOW,
 ROLL THAT THING UP. 42 INCHES.

    - JOHN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - THIS IS TOUGH.
  I-I-I COULD GO SO MANY WAYS
           WITH THIS.

             - YES?
    - I'M GONNA JUST SAY 8.
              - 8?
     - I'M GONNA GO WITH 8.

 - OKAY. LIZ, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      - I WAS VERY CLOSE.
         - SHE SAID 7.
          - 7. WELL...
    - SHE SHORTCHANGED YOU,
     SHE SHORTCHANGED YOU.

           [laughter]
  - BUT SHE WAS ONLY ONE OFF.
         IT WAS ONLY--
        IT WAS ONLY ONE,

      LIZ, SO, YOU KNOW--
          THAT'S OKAY.
     SOMETIMES YOU GOTTA DO

 OUR NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.

IN COMEDY, TIMING IS EVERYTHING,
   SO ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,
     WHEN IS THE WORST TIME
    TO JOKE AROUND WITH YOU?

             KOREY?
    - PROBABLY WHEN I'M MAD.
  - LAQUITA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

- WHEN YOU'RE PLAYING FOOTBALL.
       - YEAH, I'M ANGRY,
      SO IT GOES TOGETHER.
 YOU KNOW, YOU GOTTA BE ANGRY.
   YEAH, THAT GOES TOGETHER.

    - WE CAN'T GO WITH THAT.
      - WE CAN'T TAKE IT?
    - NO, WE CAN'T TAKE IT.
           SO SORRY.
          OKAY, JOHN?

    - I'M GONNA GO WITH, UH,
      PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

    - SOMETIMES I TAKE THAT
    PRETTY SERIOUSLY, SO...

          - OKAY, LIZ,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      - I SAID WHEN WE'RE
        HAVING A FIGHT,
'CAUSE I NEVER TAKE YOU SERIOUS
     WHEN YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

    - OH, YEAH. THAT'S GOOD.
          - ALL RIGHT.
 AND, MATTHEW, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

   IT'S WHEN I'M--I'M WORKING

   WHEN IT COMES TO SEXTING,

       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
  YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO DO IT,
  SHE'S MORE LIKELY TO DO IT,
     OR NEITHER OF YOU HAVE
   THAT TYPE OF CELL SERVICE?

             JOHN?
      - NEITHER OF US HAVE
   THAT TYPE OF CELL SERVICE.
          - OKAY, LIZ,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - NEITHER OF US.
     - NEITHER OF YOU HAVE
   THAT TYPE OF CELL SERVICE.
         - WE GOT ONE.

           - MATTHEW?
        - WELL, WE HAVE
    UNLIMITED TEXTING, SO...
            - OKAY.

     - ALL RIGHT, LAQUITA,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - LIE NUMBER 2, OR 50.
       IT'S ME, NOT YOU.
   - WHAT? YOU ALWAYS SAY I'M
 CONCEITED, AND, YOU KNOW, I--

           - SEXTING.
   - I MEAN, BUT, I MEAN, I--
 - I'M THE INITIATOR. SEXTING.

    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.
     THIS QUESTION IS WORTH
        UP TO 30 POINTS.

      ARE YOU GUYS READY?
 - WE READY, SHERRI, WE READY.
- OKAY. GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR
  WIFE COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       WHEN WE WERE FIRST
  GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

  I THOUGHT MY HUSBAND'S BLANK
    WOULD BE A DEAL BREAKER,
       BUT THEN HIS BLANK
   SEALED THE DEAL FOR LIFE.
             KOREY?

            - UH...
             WHEW.
        PROBABLY MY PAST

   WOULD BE A DEAL BREAKER...
           - MM-HMM.
            - AND...

    I'LL SAY--I'M CHARMING.
    I THINK THAT PRETTY MUCH
    SEALED THE DEAL FOR HER.
 - SEALED THE DEAL, ALL RIGHT.
   LAQUITA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

       SHE SAID YOUR EYES
     WERE THE DEAL BREAKER,
      AND YOUR PERSONALITY
        SEALED THE DEAL.
  SO YOU GOT HALF OF IT RIGHT.
            - OKAY.

   - YOU DID GET HALF OF IT.
    - WE GOT 5 POINTS, BABY,
    THAT'S COOL. ALL RIGHT.
            - JOHN?

    - UH, I HAD A PRETTY BAD
        SENSE OF STYLE,
   UH, WHEN I FIRST MET HER.
         - WHAT WAS IT?
   - I WORE HORRIBLE CLOTHES,
     LIKE, RIPPED UP JEANS,

      LIKE, DIRTY SNEAKERS
       AND OLD T-SHIRTS.
            - OKAY.
    - SO THAT MAY HAVE BEEN

          - ALL RIGHT.
  - AND I THINK I WON HER OVER
       WITH MY COMMITMENT
     AND MY LOYALTY TO HER.
     LIZ, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

           YOUR STYLE
     AND YOUR PERSONALITY.
      YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
 JOHN AND LIZ, YOU'RE TIED FOR
THE LEAD WITH MATTHEW AND INESE.

          SO, MATTHEW,
    YOU ONLY HAVE TO GET ONE
 OF THOSE ANSWERS RIGHT TO WIN.
       - THE DEAL BREAKER
        WOULD HAVE BEEN

       PROBABLY MY HAIR.
          - YOUR HAIR?

THAT WON HER OVER WAS MY SMILE.

      YOUR WIFE WOULD MAKE

      MY WIFE IS AN ANGEL,
       BUT IF SHE ENDS UP

      IT'LL BE BECAUSE OF

    AND, YOU KNOW, ONE DAY,
     SHE GOES TO THE MALL,
   AND, YOU KNOW, JUST BLOWS
 A TON OF MONEY, BUT COMES BACK

    AND THEN TELLS ME, LIKE,
  A LITTLE LESS OF AN AMOUNT.
             - OHH.
           - SHE'S--
  - SO DID SHE GET IN TROUBLE?
       YOU TALKED TO HER?

    - YEAH, BUT WE SMOOTHED
EVERYTHING OUT LATER THAT NIGHT,

  THE SHOPPING THING AS WELL.

   WHAT DID YOU SAY, STEVEN?
         - THE BIG ONE.
 - ABLE TO HANDLE BIG DEPOSITS.
            - WHOO!
            - YEAH.

             MEGAN.
         - I WOULD SAY
      HANDLE BIG DEPOSITS,
       BECAUSE HE'S LARGE
         AND IN CHARGE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
     JON, AS YOU SIT THERE
       AND GRIN SILENTLY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY,
    MR. LARGE AND IN CHARGE?

 - I SAID HANDLE BIG DEPOSITS.
            - YEAH.
       - WHOO! YES! YEAH!
           - KELLIE.

    - WELL, HE HAS BIG FEET
     AND HE'S REALLY TALL,
SO I'D SAY HANDLE BIG DEPOSITS.
   - OKAY. I LOVE THIS VISUAL
    I'M GETTIN'. ALL RIGHT.

             MATT.
       - UNFORTUNATELY--
        OPEN YEAR-ROUND.
       - OPEN YEAR-ROUND.
              AW.

   - WELL, THAT'S TRUE, TOO.
    - HE SAID YOU'RE LIKE--
     HE'S LIKE, ATM, 24/7.
 - I MEAN, IT CAN GO BOTH WAYS.
            - YEAH.

- BIG DEPOSITS, OPEN YEAR-ROUND.
       IT'S LIKE THE BEST
        OF BOTH WORLDS.
          - ALL RIGHT,
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.

     IF YOU HAVE A TERRIBLY
         STRESSFUL DAY,
       YOUR HUSBAND SAID
      YOU'D GRAB A UTENSIL
     AND WHAT COMFORT FOOD?

             MEGAN.
 - I'M GONNA GO WITH ICE CREAM,
    'CAUSE I LOVE ICE CREAM.
SPECIFICALLY COOKIE DOUGH, BUT--

      - OOH, THAT'S GOOD,
    COOKIE DOUGH ICE CREAM.
 - YEAH, I LOVE ME SOME COOKIE
 DOUGH. I JUST EAT IT STRAIGHT
    OUT OF THE COOKIE STATE.
 - OKAY. JON, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

       - I SAID BROWNIES.
          - BROWNIES.
             - OHH.
       - I WAS THINKING--
   I WAS THINKING CHOCOLATE.

   - KELLIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I WOULD SAY CUPCAKE.
  UM, I REALLY LOVE CUPCAKES.
WE HAVE A WHOLE TECHNIQUE GOIN'.

    I EAT THE FROSTING PART,
      HE EATS THE BOTTOM,
     SO DEFINITELY CUPCAKE.
   - YOU GUYS WORK TOGETHER.
             - YES.

   - SO WHAT'D YOU SAY, MATT?
 - I DEFINITELY SAID CUPCAKES.
     - CUPCAKES, ALL RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.

    NOELLE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - UM, ICE CREAM.
    - WHAT KIND OF ICE CREAM
          DO YOU LIKE?

     - UM, I LIKE 'EM ALL.
    - OH, YOU LIKE 'EM ALL.
     ANY PARTICULAR FLAVOR?
  - BUT IF I HAVE TO NARROW IT
 DOWN, IT'D BE CHOCOLATE CHIP.

     - OOH, CHOCOLATE CHIP.
  SOUNDS GOOD. WHAT'D YOU SAY?
  - YEAH, BUT I HAVE A LITTLE
     VANILLA WITH IT, TOO,
       SO IT'S ALL RIGHT.
        - YEAH, YOU SEE?

       - A LITTLE VANILLA
   WITH THAT CHOCOLATE CHIP.
    STEVEN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
          - ICE CREAM.

           ICE CREAM.
      WHAT'S THAT PHRASE?
    I SCREAM, YOU SCREAM, WE
ALL SCREAM FOR ICE CREAM. YEAH.
       ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
      MY WIFE IS AN ANGEL,
       BUT IF SHE ENDS UP
         GOING TO HELL,

      IT'LL BE BECAUSE OF
     THE TIME SHE BLANKED.
            KELLIE.
   - SPENT TOO MUCH SHOPPING.

 - YOU SPEND TOO MUCH SHOPPING?
   - YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY MUCH
  WHAT WE ALWAYS BICKER ABOUT.
 - OKAY. MATT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

    - I SAID SPENT TOO MUCH
           SHOPPING.
   - SPENT TOO MUCH SHOPPING.
            NOELLE.
       - I'M PRETTY BAD.

 I MEAN, I'VE DONE SOME THINGS
       THAT, LIKE, WILL--
             - MMM.
     - UM, HIT THE GARAGE?
     - YOU HIT THE GARAGE.
         WITH YOUR CAR?

         - YEAH, YEAH.
          - WHY--YOU--
        YOU CAN'T DRIVE?
           - MY CAR.
      - NO, UM, I WASN'T--
       I WAS--I WASN'T--

        I WAS PREGNANT,
   AND HE BOUGHT ME A CAMARO
       AND I COULDN'T SEE
        IN FRONT OF IT,
   SO I COULDN'T GO ANYWHERE,
  SO I WAS, LIKE, GOIN' CRAZY.

 I WAS LIKE, "LET ME JUST DRIVE
     AROUND THE BACKYARD,"
AND HE CALLED ME AND I PANICKED,
    'CAUSE I THOUGHT HE WAS,
       LIKE, COMIN' HOME,

 SO I TRIED TO PARK REAL QUICK
     AND I HIT THE GARAGE.
- OHH, THE CAMARO HE BOUGHT YOU?
   - HE ASKED WHAT HAPPENED.
  I WAS LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW."

     - WHY ARE YOU LETTIN'
       THIS WOMAN DRIVE?
  - THAT WAS IT, THAT WAS IT.
       - AND THAT WAS IT.
         - THAT WAS IT.
            - YEAH.

   - STEVEN, WHY DID YOU SAY
  YOUR WIFE WOULD GO TO HELL?
    - THE MOMENT SHE MET ME.
     - BECAUSE YOU MET HIM.
             - AW.
         - I LOVE THIS.

        LOOK AT NOELLE.
 SHE'S LIKE, "THAT'S SO SWEET,
      I'M GONNA GO TO HELL
       'CAUSE I MET YOU."
        THAT'S SO SWEET.
        WHAT THE HECK--

     WHY WOULD HE HAVE YOU
         GOIN' TO HELL?
       - HE'S A BAD BOY.
        - HE'S A BAD BOY
     AND YOU'RE A BAD GIRL.
         - YEAH, YEAH.

 - WE GONNA REALLY HAVE TO TALK
          TO YOU GUYS.
           - MM-HMM.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, MEGAN?

      I WAS THINKING ALSO
       SHOPPING TOO MUCH.
I LOVE TO BUY GIFTS FOR PEOPLE,
       AND I GO TO TARGET
          AND COME OUT
    WITH ALL KINDS OF STUFF.

  - OOH, "TAR-JAY," I LOVE IT.
       - YEAH, HE'S LIKE,
   "HOW MUCH DID YOU SPEND?"
      I'M LIKE, YOU KNOW,
     "$25, $45, $75, $100."

   BUT IT'S STUFF WE NEEDED.
        IT'S, YOU KNOW,
     AND FOR OTHER PEOPLE.
        - DO YOU SAY IT
    IN THAT SINGSONG VOICE--

         $25, $35, $45?
- YEAH, AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN
 HE GETS THE REAL NUMBER MAYBE
WHEN THE RECEIPT GETS TURNED IN,
      YOU KNOW, AT THE END
         OF THE MONTH.

      SO TOO MUCH SHOPPING
  OR BUYING GIFTS FOR PEOPLE.
            - OKAY.
     JON, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

 ALL RIGHT, LADIES, IT IS YOUR
TURN TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.
          THESE NEXT 3
   ARE WORTH 10 POINTS EACH.
         ARE YOU READY?
         - WE'RE READY.

            - OKAY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   - YOU'RE LIKE, I'M TRYING,
     I'M THINKING ABOUT IT.
      HERE WE GO, LADIES.

     WHICH OF THESE NUMBERS
        IS THE LARGEST?
      YOUR HUSBAND'S AGE,
         HIS BELT SIZE,
         OR THE NUMBER
  OF HIS PAST SEXUAL PARTNERS?

            MM-HMM.
            NOELLE.
 - ALL RIGHT, SHERRI, WE'VE ALL
    SEEN MY HUSBAND, RIGHT?
          - OH, OKAY.
   - WE KNOW HE'S A BIG BOY.

    SO LET'S KEEP IT FUNKY.
           - [laughs]
  - I WOULD SAY HIS BELT SIZE.
           OH. MEGAN.

  - EVER SINCE WE GOT MARRIED,
    WE'VE KIND OF GOT THOSE
    MUFFIN TUMMIES GOING ON.
             - OH.
 THAT'S CALLED HAPPINESS, YEAH.

     - OKAY, THERE YOU GO,
 THERE YOU GO. WE'LL TAKE THAT.
   BUT YEAH, BELT SIZE, YEAH.
        - OKAY. KELLIE.
- WELL, I MEAN, HE'S NOT REALLY
  OLD, SO IT CAN'T BE HIS AGE,

      AND YOU KNOW, LIKE,
    HE'S A PRETTY GOOD BOY.
            - OKAY.
   - SO I GUESS I WOULD HAVE
TO SAY BELT SIZE, JUST DEFAULT.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
        THEY SAY AMERICA
    IS THE LAND OF THE FREE

     AND HOME OF THE BRAVE,
      BUT I BEG TO DIFFER,
 BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING BRAVE
        ABOUT MY HUSBAND
    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
             MEGAN.

- HE DOES NOT LIKE KILLING BUGS
          AND INSECTS.
    AND HE WANTS THAT THING
       FROM SkyMall THAT
 JUST ZAPS THEM FROM FAR AWAY.
             - OH.

   - AND SO I'M ALWAYS LIKE,
 "OH, MY GOSH," AND HE'S LIKE,
 "OH, MY GOSH," AND SO WE BOTH
FIGHT OVER WHO'S GONNA KILL IT,
         - SO YOU GUYS
      ARE BOTH SCREAMING.

   - AND USUALLY HE DOES IT,
          I MAKE HIM.
        - OKAY. KELLIE.
     - HE MENTIONED BEFORE
   THAT HE WAS ALWAYS SCARED

 OF HAUNTED HOUSES GROWING UP,
SO MAYBE THAT STILL IS CURRENT,
  SO LET'S SAY HAUNTED HOUSES.
  - HAUNTED HOUSES. ALL RIGHT.
            NOELLE.

 - I WOULD SAY, OH, HE DOESN'T
  LIKE WIPING OUR KID'S NOSE.
         - HE'S SCARED
     OF WIPING THEIR NOSES?
   - HE THINKS IT'S SO GROSS.
            - YEAH?

        - BABY BOOGERS.
            - OKAY.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
       WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
    WAS CHASING YOUR RAINBOW

     ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT,
   HOW MANY TIMES DID HE FIND
       YOUR POT O' GOLD?
            KELLIE.

  - JUST ON THE WEDDING NIGHT?
    - ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT.
            - ZERO.
     - ZERO. WHAT HAPPENED?
 - WELL, WE HAD THE AFTER PARTY
      IN OUR HOTEL SUITE,

          AND SO THERE
   WAS A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE,
     BUT THEN WHEN EVERYONE
     STARTED CLEARING OUT,
     I WENT INTO OUR HOTEL,
          LIKE, ROOM,

    AND HE WAS JUST ASLEEP.
           - NO GOLD.
   - WE FIGURED WE HAD A LOT
   OF TIME TO MAKE UP FOR IT,
     SO THERE WAS NO GOLD.
        - OKAY. NOELLE.

   - WE WERE REALLY DRUNK...
           - UH-HUH.
           - SO ZERO.
         - SO NOTHING.
- WE WERE NO GOOD TO EACH OTHER.

      THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
  SOME SLOPPY SEX. I'M SORRY.
            - MEGAN.
    - I'M GONNA GO WITH ONE,
 BECAUSE WE WAITED TO HAVE SEX
     TILL WE WERE MARRIED,

     SO WE ARE READY TO GO.
             - OH.
     SO YEAH. SO WE DIDN'T
      SKIP ANYTHING, YEAH.
     - OH, THAT'S SO SWEET.

    - YEAH, SO WE DID, YEAH.
          IT WAS FUN.
    - LADIES, HERE'S A BONUS
  QUESTION. IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
     MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT
          COMPROMISE,
   WHICH MEANS I GET TO FORCE
 MY HUSBAND TO GO TO THE BLANK,

 AND HE GETS TO DRAG ME KICKING
  AND SCREAMING TO THE BLANK.
            NOELLE.
      - I GET TO DRAG HIM
         TO THE STORES.

           - MM-HMM.
    - AND HE GETS TO DRAG ME
           TO, LIKE,
 CAR OR MOTORCYCLE CONVENTIONS.

 - OKAY. MEGAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - DRAG HIM TO THE STORES,
      EITHER GROCERY STORE
      OR MALL OR WHATEVER.
           - MM-HMM.

  - HE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE IT,
   AND THEN HE WOULD DRAG ME
     TO, I GUESS, I'D SAY,
  MAYBE, LIKE, SPORTS EVENTS.
      - ALL RIGHT. KELLIE.
  - I DRAG HIM TO THE STORES,

   BUT THEN I'M A GOOD GIRL,
I APPRECIATE GOD AND EVERYTHING,
  BUT I WOULD SAY HE DRAGS ME
KICKING AND SCREAMING TO CHURCH.
    - KICKING AND SCREAMING
         TO THE CHURCH.

   THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
        WE ARE GONNA SEE
  JUST HOW WELL THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS,

  AND FOR MORE NEWLYWED GAME,
            GO TO...
   - OKAY, THE GUYS ARE BACK
             TO SEE
 IF THEY CAN MATCH THE ANSWERS
       THEIR WIVES GAVE,

     BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT,
  WE GOTTA CHECK ON THE SCORE.

    BECAUSE ALL OF YOU GUYS

            STEVEN.
  - HMM, PAST SEXUAL PARTNERS.
  - YOUR PAST SEXUAL PARTNERS.
     YOU GOT A LOT OF 'EM,
       HAD A LOT OF 'EM?

- NOT LIKE A LOT, BUT YOU KNOW,
          IT'S ENOUGH.
           - [laughs]
  - NOELLE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- SHE'S MET THEM, MOST OF THEM.

   - SHE SAID YOUR BELT SIZE.
        - I'M SO SORRY.
 I KNOW HE'S A FREAK, BUT DANG.

             - JON.
        - WELL, MY WIFE
     WAS MY FIRST PARTNER,
      SO I'M GONNA SAY...

   - THAT IS JUST VERY COOL.
 CAN WE GIVE 'EM A HAND? THAT'S
   JUST--IT'S PRETTY AWESOME.
     [cheers and applause]

ISN'T IT SOMETHING KNOWING A MAN
    JUST IS WAITING FOR YOU?
IT JUST MAKES YOUR HEART SWELL.
          KEEP GOING.

       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
        THEY SAY AMERICA
    IS THE LAND OF THE FREE
   AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE,
      BUT I BEG TO DIFFER,

 BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING BRAVE
        ABOUT MY HUSBAND
    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
              JON.
  - I'M GONNA GO WITH SPIDERS
            OR BUGS.

    I'M REALLY NOT A BIG FAN
            OF BUGS.
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.
     I'LL KILL 'EM FOR HER,
   BUT I DON'T LIKE TO DO IT.

     - IS IT BECAUSE YOU'RE
      VERY COMPASSIONATE,
  OR ARE YOU JUST SCARED TO...
        - COMPASSIONATE.
      LET'S GO WITH THAT.

 - WE'LL GO WITH COMPASSIONATE.
             MEGAN.
            INSECTS.
             - YAY!

    - MATT, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - IF I STUB MY TOE, SHE COMES
 RUNNING OVER AND HELPS ME OUT
        OR IF I'M SICK,

      SO YOU KNOW, ANYTIME
 I'M INJURED OR SICK, I'D SAY,
    I'M NOT THE BRAVEST GUY
           OUT THERE.
        - OKAY. KELLIE.

    - I SAID HAUNTED HOUSES.
         - OH. THAT'S--
      WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,
  I WAS ALWAYS, ALWAYS AFRAID
TO GO ON THE HAUNTED HOUSE RIDE.

            - OKAY.
   WHAT DID YOU SAY, STEVEN?
          - HOUSEWORK.
          - HOUSEWORK?
    - I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

        - SO DOES NOELLE
     DO ALL THE HOUSEWORK?
   - YEAH, AND THEN I'LL HIRE
      SOMEBODY TO DO SOME.
        - OH, ALL RIGHT.
 - YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

            - OKAY.
   NOELLE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
SHE SAID WIPING THE KID'S NOSES.
            - WHAT?
 - YOU DON'T LIKE BABY BOOGERS.

      YOU'RE ALWAYS LIKE,
     EW, WHEN THE KIDS DO,
 IT'S ALL SLOBBERY AND DROOLY,
      OR THEY GOT A COLD.
           - [sighs]
          - ALL RIGHT.

       I'M GONNA ASK YOU
  THE NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
     WHEN YOU WERE CHASING
      YOUR WIFE'S RAINBOW
     ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT,

   HOW MANY TIMES DID SHE SAY
   YOU FOUND HER POT O' GOLD?
             MATT.
   - THAT'S A REAL TOUGH ONE.
       - WHY IS IT TOUGH?

   - I HAD A COUPLE OF DRINKS
    AT THE WEDDING LATER ON,
          SO YOU KNOW,
 WE DIDN'T REALLY CONSUMMATE IT
  TILL LATER ON THE NEXT DAY.
             - OH.
