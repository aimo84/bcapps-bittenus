     THE THOUGHT OF MY SONS
      GROWING UP WITHOUT ME
  INSPIRED ME TO QUIT SMOKING.

     I TALKED TO MY DOCTORS,
      AND THEN I THREW AWAY
       ALL MY CIGARETTES,
     ASHTRAYS AND LIGHTERS.
      I STARTED EXERCISING
      INSTEAD OF SMOKING.

 LETTING MY FRIENDS ONLINE KNOW
I WAS QUITTING KEPT ME ON TRACK.
 STAYING AWAY FROM ALCOHOL WHEN
 I WAS FIRST QUITTING WAS KEY.
        I KEPT ON TRYING.
  LEARNED SOMETHING EACH TIME.

      DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.
    NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES
            IT TAKES.
           WE DID IT.
          YOU CAN TOO.

  JON AND MEGAN, YOU GUYS ARE
  IN THE LEAD WITH 40 POINTS.
      YOU ARE FOLLOWED BY
        MATT AND KELLIE
IN SECOND PLACE WITH 30 POINTS.

STEVEN AND NOELLE, YOU GUYS ARE
 IN THIRD PLACE WITH 20 POINTS.
         NOW IT IS TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.
  IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
     IT IS ANYBODY'S GAME.

    COUPLES, ARE YOU READY?
          HERE WE GO.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
     MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT
          COMPROMISE,

   WHICH MEANS I GET TO FORCE
 MY HUSBAND TO GO TO THE BLANK,
 AND HE GETS TO DRAG ME KICKING
  AND SCREAMING TO THE BLANK.
            STEVEN.

   - SHE DRAGS ME TO THE MALL
          OR SHOPPING.
           - MM-HMM.
  - YOU HATE GOING EVERYWHERE
     UNLESS IT'S SHOPPING.

    OH, TO RETURN SOMETHING.
  - TO RETURN SOMETHING. OKAY.
           - [laughs]
   - WHAT DID YOU SAY, GIRL?

        WELL, THE STORES
   AND THE CAR AND MOTORCYCLE
          CONVENTIONS,
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
             - OH.

     I WAS GONNA SAY THAT.
        - I'M SO SORRY,
       STEVEN AND NOELLE.
    IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO WIN.
      - THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

            - MATT.
  - YEAH, WE WERE AT THE MALL
THIS PAST WEEKEND, SO I'M GONNA
     SAY PROBABLY SHOPPING.
            - OKAY.

     - AND SHE KNOWS I HATE
   BEING IN STORES WITH HER.
  AND THEN ON THE OTHER SIDE,
        I ALMOST HAVE TO
    DRAG HER OUT THE DOOR--

  WE ALMOST, THIS PAST MONTH,
WE WANTED TO GO TO EASTER MASS,
  AND I WANTED TO GO TO, LIKE,
       THE EASTER VIGIL,
   WHICH WAS THE LONGER MASS,

   WHICH IS UP TO TWO HOURS.
   SHE'S JUST LIKE, "I DON'T
   WANT TO SIT THROUGH THAT.
   "I DON'T WANT TO BE THERE
     THREE HOURS, TWO HOURS

       WASTING MY TIME."
             - OH.
 - SO I'LL SAY CHURCH TO THAT.
    - TO CHURCH, ALL RIGHT.
   KELLIE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  SHOPPING STORES AND CHURCH.

    - LET ME JUST TELL YOU,
  EASTER VIGIL IS THREE HOURS.
 - EASTER VIGIL IS THREE HOURS.
         - THREE HOURS.

      - THREE HOURS LONG.
      - IT'S THREE HOURS.
      - IT'S JESUS, GIRL!
     BUT HALLELUJAH, YOU'RE
 IN THE LEAD RIGHT NOW, KELLIE.

            - WHOO!
            - OKAY.
JON, YOU HAVE TO GET BOTH RIGHT
            TO WIN.

        SO NO PRESSURE.
 I'M GONNA GO WITH THE GROCERY
  STORE THAT SHE DRAGS ME TO,
       'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T
  LIKE TO GO GROCERY SHOPPING.

       I THINK SHE LIKES
        HAVING ME THERE.
     AND I GUESS I DRAG HER
   TO SPORTING EVENTS MAYBE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    MEGAN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

THE STORES AND SPORTING EVENTS.
        CONGRATULATIONS!
  ALL RIGHT, CONGRATULATIONS,
         JON AND MEGAN.
      YOU ARE THE WINNERS.

         YOU ARE GOING
     TO TANQUE VERDE RANCH.

     IN TANQUE VERDE RANCH.

            - WHOO!
 - THAT'S OUR SHOW, EVERYBODY.
     THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
  <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i> GOOD NIGHT.
   - HI, I'M SHERRI SHEPHERD.

   THERE'S AN OLD CURSE THAT
 SAYS THREE TIMES A BRIDESMAID,
  NEVER A BRIDE, AS IF WEARING
THREE HIDEOUS BRIDESMAID DRESSES
      WASN'T CURSE ENOUGH.

           [laughter]
- HERE ARE TONIGHT'S NEWLYWEDS.
 OUR FIRST COUPLE SHOT HOURS OF
VIDEO TO REMEMBER THEIR WEDDING.

    UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS FOR
  AN EPISODE OF "BRIDEZILLAS."
  MEET DEBORIS AND STEPHANIE.
     THEY WERE BOTH VIRGINS
     WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED,

   SO THEIR WEDDING NIGHT WAS
  THEIR FIRST TIME AND SECOND
     AND THIRD AND FOURTH.
  WELCOME JUSTIN AND BRITTANY.

     AND THEY CHOREOGRAPHED
    AND DANCED TO <i>THRILLER </i>
       <i>FOR THEIR WEDDING.</i>
 COULD HAVE BEEN SCARIER. COULD
  HAVE BEEN THE CHICKEN DANCE.

   HERE ARE CHRIS AND ALICIA.
 LET'S PLAY <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
         [upbeat music]

   Captioned provided by GSN.
     [cheers and applause]
          - HEY. HEY.

       HELLO AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
         HELLO, FELLAS.
         - HEY, SHERRI.
 - WE SENT YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE

       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
    WE'LL GET RIGHT INTO IT.
          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

     WHEN IT COMES TO SEX,
   THE MOST SPECIFIC REQUEST
  MY WIFE EVER MADE WAS BLANK.
            DEBORIS?
 - TO MAKE SURE I TAKE MY TIME.

     SOMETIMES I, YOU KNOW,
   ONCE YOU GET IN THE MOOD,
  YOU'RE JUST READY TO... POW!
           [laughter]
            - SO...
  - SO TAKE--TAKING MORE TIME.

      - TAKING TIME, YEAH.
        - OKAY. JUSTIN?
    - WELL, SHE ALWAYS SAYS
    YOU CAN'T PUT THE TURKEY
        RIGHT IN FIRST.

       YOU GOT TO PREHEAT
        THE OVEN FIRST.
 - YOU GOT TO PREHEAT THE OVEN.
            - YEAH.
AND TYPICALLY FOR HER THAT MEANS

  I HAVE TO MASSAGE HER FIRST,
    SO THAT'S WHAT THE MOST
SPECIFIC THING IS--MASSAGE HER.
      - 'CAUSE THE OVEN'S
GOT TO BE WARMED UP. ALL RIGHT.

             CHRIS?
   - LIKE, I'M PRETTY QUIET.
 LIKE, I-I DON'T REALLY, LIKE,
  SHOUT OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,
       WHEREAS SHE'S MORE
    INTO THAT KIND OF STUFF.

            - YEAH.
- SO SHE WANTS ME TO BE LOUDER.
   - HOW WOULD YOU BE LOUDER?
- WHAT, HOW SHE WANTS ME TO BE?
   - YEAH. LIKE, YOU KNOW...
       - [groans loudly]

           [cheering]
      - GENTLEMEN, THIS IS
       OUR NEXT QUESTION.
  WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME

       YOU AND YOUR WIFE
       WENT TO BED ANGRY?
            JUSTIN.
   - THERE'S ONE THING THAT--
THE DUMPSTER'S KIND OF FAR AWAY.
            - OKAY.

     - SO I TAKE THE TRASH
       OUT OF THE BIN...
          - ALL RIGHT.
      - AND THEN I PUT IT
   RIGHT ON THE FRONT PORCH.

 AND SHE THINKS I SHOULD GO OUT
 IN THE RAIN JUST FOR THE TRASH
    TO NOT BE ON THE PORCH.
  IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME.
        - [laughs] OKAY.

     WHAT ABOUT YOU, CHRIS?
 - I TOLD HER FOR MOTHER'S DAY
           AS A GIFT,
       LIKE, TAKE A TRIP
        TO PENNSYLVANIA,

      'CAUSE WE LIKE TO GO
        TO PENNSYLVANIA.
    AND THEN WE WERE TALKING
      ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT,
 AND SHE CHECKED IT, AND ALL OF
    THE ROOMS ARE BOOKED UP.

      SO I'D SAY PROBABLY
  NOT BOOKING THE--THE HOTEL.
        - OKAY. DEBORIS?
  - UM, I MEAN, TO BE HONEST,
  I DON'T KNOW WHY WE FOUGHT,

   BUT I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
            - OKAY.
        - I MEAN, I KNOW
     I SLEPT ON THE COUCH.
             - YES.

  - I KNOW SHE MADE SOME FOOD
THAT WAS VERY NASTY ON PURPOSE.
    [laughter and applause]
- DON'T CLAP. THAT'S NOT FUNNY.

   - AND YOU CANNOT REMEMBER
     AT ALL WHY YOU FOUGHT.
 - OH, I'M GONNA GET IN TROUBLE
           FOR THIS.
    LET'S SAY MONEY ISSUES.
          - ALL RIGHT.

       GENTLEMEN, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
       OF ALL THE GUESTS
        AT YOUR WEDDING,
 WHO WAS THE HOTTEST ONE THERE?

             CHRIS?
       - IT'D PROBABLY BE
      HER FRIEND DANIELLE.
- WHAT DOES DANIELLE LOOK LIKE?

     - SHE'S TALL AND THIN.
   LIKE, SHE'S KNOWN MY WIFE
    FOR YEARS AND YOU KNOW.
            [laughs]
- OKAY. DEBORIS, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

- I'M NOT GONNA GO WITH ANYBODY
    ELSE OTHER THAN MY WIFE.
     YOU'RE NOT GETTING ME
          IN TROUBLE.
      IT'S MY WIFE'S DAY.
SHE LOOKED THE BEST HANDS DOWN.

   - [laughs] I LOVE DEBORIS.
  HE SHOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT.
 BUT THE QUESTION IS OUT OF ALL
  THE GUESTS AT YOUR WEDDING.
         - OH, COME ON,
    YOU CAN'T DO THAT TO ME.

             - YES.
      - IF YOU'RE GONNA GO
      THAT ROUTE, HER MOM.
     [cheers and applause]

 - I MEAN, THEY LOOK IDENTICAL.
      SHE JUST DIDN'T HAVE
 A WHITE DRESS ON. SO HER MOM.
       - OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
    JUSTIN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - I WASN'T LOOKING AT ANYBODY
    ELSE EXCEPT FOR MY WIFE,
        BECAUSE SHE WAS
      THE MOST BEAUTIFUL--
           SHE WAS...
          - YES, SIR!

         - HANDS DOWN.
    I CAN'T--SO IT WAS LIKE
         TUNNEL VISION.
    I WAS DANCING LIKE THIS
     LOOKING AT MY WIFE...

          - ALL RIGHT.
          - LIKE THIS.
      BUT A BUDDY OF MINE
      I PLAYED SOCCER WITH
     AND A GIRL THAT SHE--

      HOLD ON, THE BUDDY'S
      NOT THE HOTTEST ONE.
THIS GIRL THAT SHE WORKED WITH--
       THEY GOT TOGETHER,
     ALL OVER EACH OTHER...
            - RIGHT.

 - SO SHE MUST HAVE BEEN DOING
  SOMETHING RIGHT THAT NIGHT,
    SO I'M GONNA SAY IT WAS
   MY WIFE'S FRIEND KRYSTAL.
           - KRYSTAL.
             - YES.

- ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, THANK YOU.
           NICE JOB.
       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,
BECAUSE THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST
 POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME

         - HI, SHERRI.
             - HEY.
   WELL, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,

  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
       IS WORTH 5 POINTS.
      HERE WE GO, LADIES.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
     WHEN IT COMES TO SEX,
   THE MOST SPECIFIC REQUEST
  MY WIFE EVER MADE WAS BLANK.

           STEPHANIE?
        - FROM THE BACK?
           [laughter]
         - FROM THE...

   WHAT DID YOU SAY, DEBORIS?
  - MAKE SURE I TAKE MY TIME.
 - MAKE SURE HE TAKES HIS TIME.
           - COME ON!

    - WHEN YOU'RE GETTING IT
         FROM THE BACK.
   TAKE YOUR TIME WHEN YOU'RE
   GETTING IT FROM THE BACK.
            - OKAY.
   BRITTANY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

- TO LET ME BE ON TOP. [laughs]
    - TO LET YOU BE ON TOP.
   IS THAT A PROBLEM THAT...
        - I'M MORE THAN
     ACCOMMODATING, SHERRI.

    MORE THAN ACCOMMODATING.
 - I GOT THAT FROM YOU, JUSTIN.
          - THANK YOU.
  - JUSTIN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   JUSTIN SAID MASSAGING YOU.
         - MASSAGE HER.

         - OH. DANG IT.
           - [laughs]
    ALICIA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
         TO SAY HARDER.

           - HARDER.
     [cheers and applause]
      - ALL RIGHT, CHRIS.
     CHRIS SAID BE LOUDER.
             - MM.

     - YOU ALWAYS TELL ME,
      "COME ON. BE LOUDER.
   GET INTO IT. GET INTO IT."
       - MM-HMM, MM-HMM.
  - WHAT DID WE COME UP WITH,
             CHRIS?

       - [groans loudly]
             - OH!
        - IT'S A START.
THE OTHER ONES WILL BE MASSAGE,

    GOING IN FROM THE BACK,
           AND HARD.
    BOY, I'M GONNA TELL YOU.
   ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION,
            LADIES.

   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
            HAPPENED
     THE LAST TIME YOU TWO
       WENT TO BED ANGRY?
           BRITTANY?

      - PROBABLY ABOUT HIM
       NOT--NOT LISTENING
   TO SOMETHING THAT I SAID.
 I DON'T KNOW--I CAN'T REMEMBER
       ANY SPECIFIC TIME,

      BUT WHENEVER I WILL
      TELL HIM SOMETHING,
   AND THEN HE WILL "PRETEND"
      THAT HE'S LISTENING,
  AND THEN LATER I'LL ASK HIM,

     AND HE WON'T REMEMBER
          WHAT IT WAS.
      - DOES HE "PRETEND"
     TO BE LISTENING A LOT?
- YES, YEAH, PROBABLY RIGHT NOW,
   HE'S PROBABLY PRETENDING.

 HE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
   WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
        - OH, BOY. MAN.
   - JUSTIN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

     JUSTIN SAID TAKING OUT
           THE TRASH.
        REMEMBER WHEN HE
      LEFT THAT TRASH OUT?
    - OH, HE TAKES IT, LIKE,
       JUST OUT THE DOOR.

    WE HAVE, LIKE, TWO DOORS
       TO OUR APARTMENT.
HE TAKES IT OUT THE FIRST DOOR,
      BUT NOT ANY FURTHER,
 AND SO THEN PEOPLE COME OVER,

     IT LOOKS LIKE WE LIVE,
      LIKE, IN A DUMPSTER.
    THERE'S ALL THIS TRASH--
  - IF SOMEONE'S COMING OVER,
        I WOULD MOVE IT,
  I WOULD TAKE IT OUT, BUT...

        - OKAY, ALICIA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- IT WAS MY FIRST MOTHER'S DAY,
  AND HE HAD SAID THAT HE WAS
  GOING TO TAKE ME ON A TRIP,

        WE WERE GONNA GO
        TO THE POCONOS,
AND HE THOUGHT THAT A FEW WEEKS
  AGO THAT I HAD BOOKED A ROOM
     AT, UM, THE HOTEL THAT
      WE USUALLY STAY IN,

     BUT I DID NOT, BECAUSE
     I THOUGHT THAT AS PER
 GIVING ME A MOTHER'S DAY GIFT,
  THAT WOULD'VE BEEN HIS JOB.
         - RIGHT, OKAY.

    CHRIS, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  HE SAID BOOKING THAT HOTEL.
          - WHOO-HOO!

    - DEBORIS AND STEPHANIE.
           STEPHANIE,
     TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
        - I'M GONNA SAY
      CELL PHONE ARGUMENT.

           - MY GOD.
    - A CELL PHONE ARGUMENT.
   - HE TOLD ME HE WAS GONNA
 DO SOMETHING, HE DIDN'T DO IT,
      I SAID MY TWO PIECE,

      AND I WENT TO SLEEP,
        JUST LIKE THAT.
  - SO WHEN YOU WENT TO SLEEP,
DID HE GET IN THE BED WITH YOU?
           - OH, NO.

      HE WAS ON THE COUCH.
  - YOU PUT HIM ON THE COUCH?
   - YES, I PUT THE PILLOW--
    HE WANTED TO GO OUTSIDE
       AND TAKE A BREATH,
        I SAID, "GOOD,"

      HE TOOK HIS BREATH,
     AND I TOOK HIS PILLOW
    AND PUT IT ON THE COUCH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    DEBORIS, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     HE SAID MONEY ISSUES.

        - OH. I MEAN...
       - THE CELL PHONE,
  I DIDN'T SLEEP ON THE COUCH,
  IT WAS THE BRINKLEY BUSINESS
  MEETING--I FORGOT TO DO IT.

  - YOU SLEPT ON THE COUCH FOR
 THE BRINKLEY BUSINESS MEETING?
            - YEAH.
       - I'M SORRY, BABY.
       - DON'T TOUCH ME!

   TELL 'EM ABOUT THAT PASTA
           YOU MADE?
     - WHEN YOU MISBEHAVE,
          GUESS WHAT?
       HE GOT SOME PASTA
    WITH SOME CHICKEN BROTH

AND SOME VEGETABLES JUST DUMPED
 IN THERE, MIX THAT BAD BOY UP,
      I WAS LIKE, "DINNER.

 WE DON'T REWARD BAD BEHAVIOR.

      WE ARE NOT REWARDING
       BAD BEHAVIOR NOW.
 - SO YOU SEE WHAT I DEAL WITH?

  - I LOVE IT, STEPHANIE SAYS,
"WE DON'T REWARD BAD BEHAVIOR."

      - WE DON'T, SHERRI.
     - SO THIS IS OUR FINAL
       QUESTION, LADIES.
       OF ALL THE GUESTS
        AT YOUR WEDDING,

    WHO DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
   WAS THE HOTTEST ONE THERE?
            ALICIA?
          - MY SISTER?
        - YOUR SISTER--

   WHAT'S YOUR SISTER'S NAME?
           - ANEICE.
   - CHRIS, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - YOUR FRIEND DANIELLE.
          - DANIELLE.

- YOU CAN SAY HOW PRETTY SHE IS
   AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT.
      - DON'T TALK TO ME.
       DON'T TALK TO ME--
    - EVEN BRIAN AND BOBBY--

- CHRIS, YOU DIDN'T SAY ANEICE,
       YOU SAID DANIELLE.
   WHY DID YOU SAY DANIELLE?
         - YEAH, CHRIS,

      - 'CAUSE I SAID SHE
     WAS, YOU KNOW, PRETTY,
    SHE'S A TALL, YOU KNOW,
  THIN GIRL. SHE'S ATTRACTIVE.
  THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WHY.
   - ALL RIGHT, OKAY. MM-HMM.

       - OKAY. STEPHANIE,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
    - I'M GONNA SAY KANISHA.

   - DEBORIS, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     DEBORIS SAID YOUR MOM.
           [laughter]

  - HEY, THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER.
    - THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
    - THAT'S A GOOD ANSWER.
           IT'S SAFE.
   - THAT WAS A SAFE ANSWER.
   - THAT WAS A GOOD ANSWER.

       - OKAY, BRITTANY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
   MY MAID OF HONOR HEATHER.
           - HEATHER.
     - WE LOOK A LOT ALIKE,

      AND SHE HAS A REALLY
        CUTE BODY, SO...
        - OKAY. JUSTIN,
      DID YOU SAY HEATHER?
        HE SAID KRYSTAL.
             - OH.

 - I DIDN'T KNOW MAID OF HONOR
          WOULD COUNT.
    - SHE'S STILL CONSIDERED
   A GUEST, BUT DO YOU AGREE,
    KRYSTAL WOULD HAVE MADE
        THE CUT AS WELL?

   - WELL, KRYSTAL'S THE ONE
    WHO GOT WITH HIS FRIEND
       AT THE WEDDING...
           - UH-HUH.
    - SO SHE WAS STIRRING UP
        A LITTLE BIT...

    - SOMETHING WAS WORKING,
      THAT'S WHAT I SAID.
- SO SHE MUST HAVE LOOKED CUTE.
          - I LOVE IT.
      ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.

     THESE NEXT 3 ARE WORTH
 10 POINTS EACH. ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.
          - LET'S GO.

      - OKAY, HERE WE GO.
LADIES, COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
    UNTIL I LIVED WITH HIM,
I NEVER KNEW JUST HOW MUCH WORK
MY HUSBAND PUT INTO TAKING CARE
         OF HIS BLANK.

           STEPHANIE?
      - OF HIS BODY HAIR.
    - ON THE BODY HAIR, YES.

       - OKAY. BRITTANY.
 - DOES IT HAVE TO BE PHYSICAL,
    OR COULD IT BE LIKE A--
    - IT COULD BE ANYTHING.
          - OH, OKAY,
  'CAUSE IT'S HIS GOLF CLUBS.

      IT'S BASICALLY LIKE
         HIS OTHER ARM.
         - OH, REALLY?
            - YEAH.
   WHEN WE FIRST GOT MARRIED,
          HE TOLD ME--

      I WENT TO GO PUT 'EM
    IN THE TRUNK OF MY CAR,
      'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE
   ANY ROOM IN OUR APARTMENT.
      "YOU CAN'T PUT THEM
         IN THE TRUNK,

 THEY'RE GONNA GET BANGED UP."
 IT'S LIKE, YOU HIT A BALL WITH
 IT, IT GETS BANGED UP ANYWAYS.
 SO NOW THEY'RE UNDER OUR BED,
        SAFE AND SOUND.

        - OKAY. ALICIA?
 - I'LL HAVE TO SAY GOLF CLUBS,
   TOO--IS THAT OKAY IF IT'S
   THE SAME ANSWER, 'CAUSE--
    - OH, YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

            - OKAY.
        - SO GOLF CLUBS?
  - I'M GONNA SAY GOLF CLUBS.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   THIS IS OUR NEXT QUESTION,
            LADIES.

WHEN YOU FIRST SET EYES ON YOUR
  HUSBANDS' EXCLAMATION POINT,
  WHICH OF THESE EXCLAMATIONS
WAS THE FIRST TO COME TO MIND--
           WOW, CUTE,

           OR YIKES?
           BRITTANY?
 - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY CUTE.
            - CUTE?

  - YEAH, 'CAUSE WE'RE, LIKE--
     WE'RE BOTH ITTY BITTY,
      SO EVERYTHING'S CUTE
            WITH US.
           - OH, BOY.

           I LOVE IT.
            ALICIA?
      - I HAVE TO SAY WOW.
             - WOW?

            - YEAH.
          - STEPHANIE.
  - IT WAS CUTE. IT WAS RIGHT
   WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE.
            - OKAY.

    - LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.
   IF WE FILLED A PIÃATA WITH
 YOUR HUSBAND'S FAVORITE SNACK,
      WHAT WOULD FALL OUT
      WHEN IT BROKE OPEN?

            ALICIA?
 - REESE'S PEANUT BUTTER CUPS.
     - OOH, THOSE ARE GOOD.
           - MM-HMM.
          - STEPHANIE?

        - I'M GONNA SAY
      MACARONI AND CHEESE.
      - OKAY. THAT'D MAKE
       ONE MESSY PIÃATA.
          - IT WOULD.
          - BRITTANY?

     - UM, I'LL HAVE TO SAY
         3 MUSKETEERS.
     - 3 MUSKETEERS, YEAH.
    - HE LOVES 3 MUSKETEERS.
        - WELL, LADIES,
  HERE IS OUR BONUS QUESTION.

    IT IS 2 PARTS, EACH PART
IS WORTH 15 POINTS. HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
THE MOST PLEASANT SURPRISE ABOUT
  BEING MARRIED TO MY HUSBAND

        HAS BEEN BLANK,
AND THE MOST UNPLEASANT SURPRISE
        HAS BEEN BLANK.
           STEPHANIE?

  - HIS SENSE OF HUMOR IS JUST
    ALWAYS RIGHT ON TIME...
            - YEAH.
    - SO I WOULD SAY THAT'S
       BEEN THE PLEASANT.

THE UNPLEASANT IS THE MESSINESS.
    - IS JUST THE MESSINESS.
             - YES.
       - OKAY. BRITTANY?
- THE MOST PLEASANT SURPRISE...
    SPENDING TIME TOGETHER.

 I DON'T KNOW, WE GET TO SPEND
    A LOT MORE TIME TOGETHER
      THAN WE DID BEFORE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
 - UM, AND THE MOST UNPLEASANT
           SURPRISE--

         HIS BREATHING.
    HIS BREATHING IS AWFUL.
      HE BREATHES SO LOUD.
        - HOW DOES HE--
   OKAY, THAT'S AN ESSENTIAL
        PART OF LIVING.

  - I KNOW! BUT EVERY NIGHT--
     - HOW DOES HE BREATHE?
  - EVERY NIGHT HE BREATHES--
         HE, LIKE, DOES
    THE OPPOSITE OF SNORING,

      LIKE, YOU DON'T HEAR
   ANYTHING WHEN IT GOES IN,
     BUT WHEN IT GOES OUT,
             IT...
      LIKE, EVERY BREATH,
           HE GOES...

 AND SO I CAN'T SLEEP AT NIGHT,
        AND THEN, LIKE--
      AND SO THE BREATHING
         IS UNPLEASANT.
   - ALICIA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS
     SO MUCH OF A SURPRISE,
BUT HE IS SUCH AN AMAZING COOK.
     HE JUST--OH, MY GOSH,
  EVERYTHING HE MAKES IS LIKE
  THE BEST MEAL I'VE EVER HAD

      IN MY WHOLE LIFE...
             - HMM.
 - AND THE MOST PLEASANT THING,
        I'D HAVE TO SAY,
   HE JUST LEAVES HIS CLOTHES
  KIND OF ALL OVER THE PLACE.

SO HE'S A BIT OF A SLOB HIMSELF.
            - OKAY.
LADIES, THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.

    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
THE MOST PLEASANT SURPRISE ABOUT
  BEING MARRIED TO MY HUSBAND

        HAS BEEN BLANK,
AND THE MOST UNPLEASANT SURPRISE
        HAS BEEN BLANK.
            DEBORIS?

   - CAN I GIVE YOU THE MOST
     UNPLEASANT ONE FIRST?
         - ABSOLUTELY.
    - OKAY, ME BEING MESSY.
    I DEFINITELY KNOW THAT.
    - AND THE MOST PLEASANT?

- GOD, THE MOST PLEASANT THING--
       MY SENSE OF HUMOR.
          - STEPHANIE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
             - YES!

 YOU GUYS ARE NOW IN THE LEAD.
         OKAY, JUSTIN?

    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
  THE WAY I TAKE CARE OF HER.
   - NOW WHAT ABOUT THE MOST
       UNPLEASANT THING?
    - THE MOST UNPLEASANT--
           THE WAY--

        THE WAY I CLEAN,
        OR DON'T CLEAN.
    - BRITTANY SAID BECAUSE
 YOU SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER,
  THE MOST PLEASANT, AND YOUR
  UNPLEASANTNESS IS BREATHING.

           [laughter]
     - I'M SO SORRY, GUYS.
      YOU DIDN'T ADVANCE.
     CHRIS, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - I'LL SAY, LIKE,
     HOW KIND-HEARTED I AM.
          - ALL RIGHT.
 - THE ONE SHE LIKES THE LEAST,
      I'D SAY IS PROBABLY
        MESSINESS, TOO.

        - OKAY, ALICIA,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    YOU'RE AN AMAZING COOK,
       AND YOU'RE MESSY.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
