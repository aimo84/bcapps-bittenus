Come on down.
Okay.

                      Thank you.
        You know, all...
           Thank you.
    All this time, I thought
     they were the Dawsons

and you're the Larsons.
Yes.
      I thought there was
  a little something going on
        'cause everybody
       kept diving away.

        I did not expect
      to come around there
    and see the two of you.
                    Could we get
             a picture of the...
                           Okay.

        This is my son,

Probably after the break.
I'll do the show.
      Break for a few days
          and then...
      [audience laughing]

          I had asked
      my other son, Mark,
         to call Gary.
      I'd asked him today.

      So, I can't tell you
     what a thrill this is.
            Paul...
    My director, Paul Alter,
    and I want to thank you.

And I thank everybody here.
One thing.
What?
It's a marvelous idea.
Not my idea.
It was Michelle Rothkop's idea.

     Michelle, you're a darling.
        And you're fired
      because I'm crying.
            And I...
      [audience laughing]

       I have five shows
          to do today.
  When you missed my birthday
      that was on the air,
         usually, I get
   the surprise of some kind

 about three or four weeks ago,
     you know, on my show.
       Today, what is...
     What's today, darling?
It's your birthday.

       So, I went back...
     No, but I went back...
          November 20
        is my birthday.
     I went back that day,
       and I asked Brian,

       the big gentleman
     who does my wardrobe,
     Tom DeLay, my writer,
      and I wrote a note.

              Now, you please...
         Well, you noticed this?
          You have to come here,
               though, Howard...
                  Alright. Okay.
              ...'cause you want
            to be on microphone.

Just what is it say.
3:30 P.M.,
October 4, 1980.
Witness: Tom J. DeLay
and Brian Higby.
             Open it up, please.

You'll see it's sealed.
Yes.
Everybody sealed the...
    But I thought I was so smart
  when I wrote that until you...

            And the winner is...
                   Now, read it.
"I, Richard Dawson,
predict that on my birthday,
November 20, 1980,

my producer will supply me
with a birthday cake
on the show.
I also read this:

On November 4,
a landslide victory
will be won
by Jimmy Carter."
      [audience laughing]

Signed, Richard Dawson.
P.S. In case of a slight error
in my calculations,
it maybe that Jimmy Carter
will surprise me

with a birthday cake
and my producer will win
the elections by a landslide."
      [audience laughing]

          Absolutely legitimate.
                         This...
                     This is one
             of my best friends.
            He's my best friend.
          His name is Tom DeLay.

           All the tonight shows
         I ever did, Tom writes,
             and he's my writer.
                          And...

     [audience applauding]
                  This is great.
                    I thank you.
                Oh, I don't know
                    what to say.

We're probably
eight minutes overtime.
Many, many, many...
          I thank you
        and I thank you.
      We'll play the Feud.

           You go...
             What?
               You go and say hi
               to the champions.
        By the time you get down
          to the real Larsons...

                 Alrighty. Fine.
          ...we'll be backstage.
      They're the champs.
 We're bringing the Larsons on.
   Welcome the Evans, please.

what to do.
Buford, it's nice to see you.

Well, uh, where were we?

Oh, how much money
have you won, Buford?
That's what I should ask.
$6,659.
Oh.

Thank goodness for that.

I hope you remember
how this game is played, Buford.

I am in such shock.
I understand
how you feel.
Alright.
We'll play the shell game.
Johnny, bring the...

Oh, that's Bob Barker.
Let's meet everybody, please.

        is my son, Mack.

Hi, Richard.
Hello, Mack.

    is his lovely wife, Shirley.
                    Hi, Richard.
And my son, Joe.

Hello.
And my daughter, Sarah.
Hi, Richard.
Hi, Sarah.
And we brought you in
from Nashville,

        but you live...
    Lawrenceburg, Tennessee.
     And all of you are...
   The home of Davy Crockett.
      Exactly. You gave me
    that raccoon first time.
              Yes.

I wish I had it now.
I could have the tail
hanging here.
You wouldn't see
my swollen eyes, would you?

No, it isn't.
We better get on
with this
because I think "Guiding Light"
comes up behind us.
     The Larsons are here.
    Make them feel at home.

     [audience applauding]
     Did you know about it?
           Yes, sir.
        You knew, yeah.
       Yes, we did know.

                I gotta go fast.

        She's waving me already.
                     I thank you
                 for being here.
                   You obviously

     I just wish you luck.
           Thank you.

   We have a little something
         for you also.
                     Oh, my God.
    Mary was very observant
        some shows ago,

          and we have
    a birthday card for you
     and a little present.
          The "I love you" sign.
                      Thank you.

        That's my sign language.
              Would you, Mary...
Wendy, would you put it on
for me, my darling?
Sure.

                      Thank you.
     Why don't we not do a show?
     Why don't we just give them
                   some money...

Yeah!
That's it.
     [audience applauding]
            Why don't we just...
                          Truly.

          Why don't we just have
        a couple of commercials,
and I'll talk a bit....
Where would you like it?
           ...and then, let them
            both play Fast Money

             and bring them back
      for the next show's round?
           'Cause there's no way
                  I'll catch up.
      We're too late, aren't we?

      We've got two Fast Moneys?

     [audience applauding]

                      Thank you.
         You know, we could play
          a couple of questions.
                  Yeah, and then
     we'll both play Fast Money.

Wouldn't that be fun?
Alright!
     [audience applauding]
         Okay, come on.
      Let's play the Feud.

          Let's do it.

     I heard all about you.
     How did you know that?

         Well, I heard about it.
        You like to play
          the horse...
        Oh, I love 'em.
                     Do you win?

                      Sometimes.
           Something people save
            from their weddings.
  A piece of the wedding cake.

            Yeah, look up there.
    You played the horses today.
              Oh!
        Oh, oh, oh, oh.

        Well, the garter
        from the bride.
               Take a look up...
      [audience laughing]

              Oh.
 See, I've been sleeping here.
                     Not at all.

It's an emotion...
That's why he's not head
of the family.
                   That's right.
                     Yeah, yeah.
      This is an emotional night
             for all of us here.

   Oh, the wedding pictures.
        Ah. Now, you're talking.
                   The pictures?

                     You got it.
     [audience applauding]
        Hello, darling.
              Hi.

                    How are you?
                Fine. Thank you.
                           Good.
   What do you think people save
            from their weddings?

    Well, they press flowers
       from the bouquet.
               They do. Alright.
                        Flowers?

             Yeah.
     [audience applauding]
               Hello, Katherine.

          Nice to have you here.
                Nice to be here.
   What do you think people save
            from their weddings?
             Okay.

        I know the bride
        saves her gown.
         Gown. Alright.
             Yeah.
                        Alright.
                       The gown?

                       Yes, sir.
     [audience applauding]
           There's $90 up there.

            Just one answer left
                 and no strikes.
      You're in good shape here.
                         We are?
                  Yeah, you are.

    The odds are in your favors.
           Walter would tell you
                        after...
         Mentioned cake, garter,
             or flowers or gown.

    I think a lot of people
     have tape recordings,
         and they save the tape.
                           Okay.
               It's what we call
         the John Dean syndrome.

                          Tapes?
           (Audience)
              Aw.
                   First strike.
                   Pretty Wendy?

    Well, I know that we had
    napkins and matches made
    with the name and date.
           Oh, I see.
       So, I would say...

            Onions.
    It's from their wedding?
Yeah, it's something people save
      from their weddings.
             Okay.
 How about a marriage license?

                      Of course.
             See, she's standing
            next to Walter so...
      [audience laughing]

                 ...it's catchy.
            Matches and napkins,
                      so I'd say
             a marriage license.

    Well, I didn't think that...
If the license's there, darling,
              you've got it all.
               Marriage license?
           Not there.
           (Audience)
              Aw.

                  Now, look that

        What's the name
      of that horse, Tom,
           we bet on?

(Tom)
Tuccurado.
What?
Tuccarado.
    Tuccarado in the fifth.

                    Oh, alright.
             I'll remember that.
          Yeah, write that down.
      If the guest book's there,
                 you got it all.
           If not, third strike.

    Evans get a chance to steal.
                     Guest book?
           Not there.

                       Brown was
            the Number 1 answer.
                    I was hoping
       you'd say black for that,
