          WE HAVE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE

           SO WE CAN
    ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.
          WE WILL GET
   RIGHT INTO IT, GENTLEMEN.
      SINCE YOU FOUND OUT
 THAT YOU AND YOUR LOVELY BRIDE

         ARE HAPPILY ON
    THE ROAD TO PARENTHOOD,
          HOW HAS YOUR
    SEX LIFE BEEN AFFECTED?
  HAS IT BEEN SMOOTH CRUISIN',

     A BIT OF A BUMPY RIDE,
     OR IS THE ROAD PRETTY
    CLOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION?
              ROB?
    - DO I ANSWER OUT LOUD?

            - YEAH--
            - YEAH?
      - YEAH, WE'D LOVE IT
   IF YOU ANSWERED OUT LOUD.
    - I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY
        SMOOTH CRUISIN'.

       - SMOOTH CRUISIN'?
            - YEAH.
    IT'S A LITTLE BABY BUMP,
       NOT A SPEED BUMP.
            - OKAY.
   - NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

            THAT IT.
    - HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU?
         - YOU'RE GONNA
    GET ME IN TROUBLE HERE.
       PROBABLY--SHE'S IN
        HER SIXTH MONTH.

     - OH, CONGRATULATIONS!
          - THANK YOU.
           - DANIEL?
 - LITTLE BIT OF A BUMPY RIDE.
       I'M KINDA NERVOUS,
I DON'T WANNA MESS ANYTHING UP.

          - [laughing]
    - WANNA TAKE IT EASY AND
 SLOW IT DOWN, JUST FOR A BIT.
  - HOW FAR ALONG IS SAMANTHA?

     - SHE'S EIGHT MONTHS.
        - EIGHT MONTHS.
       - CONGRATULATIONS
        TO YOU AS WELL.
             MATT?
  - I WOULD SAY A SMOOTH RIDE.

     I MEAN, HERE AND THERE
        WE'LL HIT A BUMP
   'CAUSE THE BABY WILL KICK,
        AND IT'S LIKE...
   I'LL TALK TO YOU TOMORROW
     TYPE THING, YOU KNOW.

 BUT I WOULD SAY A SMOOTH RIDE.
       - OKAY, AND SO HOW
      FAR ALONG IS JAYMIE?
      - ABOUT SIX MONTHS.
         - SIX MONTHS.

           ALL RIGHT,
     WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.
   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

         THE LAST TIME
    I RAISED THE WHITE FLAG
     AND SAID, "I GIVE UP,"
     WAS WHEN MY WIFE AND I
   WERE ARGUING ABOUT BLANK.

            DANIEL?
     - I WOULD SAY COOKIN'.
            - YEAH?
    DO YOU COOK? DOES SHE--
           - I COOK.

       WE SHARE THE LOAD.
BUT SOMETIMES SHE NEEDS TO REST,
   SO I TRY TO TAKE OVER AND
SHE ENJOYS IT THEN SHE EATS IT.
          BUT IF NOT,
    IT GOES TO THE SIDE, SO.

            - OKAY.
           - COOKIN'.
            - MATT?
- I GUESS IT'D BE A CAMPING TRIP
      SHE'S SENDING ME ON.
      I WAS GONNA BACK OUT

FOR A MINUTE, 'CAUSE THERE'S ALL
    KINDS OF STUFF GOING ON.
       BUT I'D SAY THAT'S
          PROBABLY IT.
        - CAMPING TRIP?
        - CAMPING TRIP.

     - WHAT ABOUT YOU, ROB?
  - SHE WAS TRYING TO TALK ME
 INTO, WITH HER BEING PREGNANT,
 THAT IT'S ACTUALLY TEN MONTHS
      AND NOT NINE MONTHS,

     BUT I KEPT TELLING HER
         IT'S NOT TRUE.
  BUT SHE SAID IT'S 40 WEEKS.
   DIVIDE IT BY FOUR WEEKS IN
      EACH MONTH, IT'S 10.

SO I WAS TRYING TO TELL HER THAT
  EVERY MONTH IS NOT THE SAME,
AND SOME MONTHS HAVE, YOU KNOW,
 A LITTLE EXTRA WEEK IN THERE.
          - YOU STILL
    THINK IT'S NINE MONTHS?

      - IT'S NINE MONTHS,
        I MEAN...RIGHT?
       - IT'S TEN MONTHS!
        IT'S TEN MONTHS.
     - I GOTTA LEARN THAT,
  THAT'S WHY WE'RE NEWLYWEDS.

     I STILL HAVE TO LEARN.
          - [laughing]
     - KEEP PLAYING ALONG,
         THAT'S RIGHT.
            - OKAY.

          THIS IS OUR
   FINAL QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
    WHAT IS THE MOST BIZARRE
 FOOD CRAVING YOUR WIFE HAS HAD
   WHILE SHE'S BEEN PREGNANT?

             MATT?
    - IT'S NOT TOO BIZARRE.
      BUT I HAVE GONE OUT
 A COUPLE TIMES AT, LIKE, 10:00
    FOR A BROWNIE OBSESSION.
            - OKAY.

     - IT'S SOMETHING AT A
          RESTAURANT.
  BUT IT'S THIS BROWNIE THING.
        I THINK IT'S GOT
     ICE CREAM AND FUDGE--

   I JUST GO AND PICK IT UP.
          - OKAY. ROB?
         - NOT TOO MUCH
        CRAZY CRAVINGS.
   BUT MORE LIKE SWEET STUFF.
     LIKE, A LOT OF CANDY.

  SHE DEFINITELY LIKES SWEDISH
   FISH AND SOUR PATCH KIDS.
       - JUST THE CANDY?
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
           - DANIEL?
 - I WOULD SAY CRAZY CRAVINGS,

         UH, SHE LOVES
     LEMON JUICE AND SALT.
    - LEMON JUICE AND SALT.
   SHE WILL CUT UP CUCUMBERS,
     MAKE A CUCUMBER SALAD,

    WITH LEMON JUICE, SALT,
          AND PEPPER.
             - OOH!
            - YEAH.
    OKAY, NICE JOB, FELLAS!

     I HOPE YOUR WIVES CAN
      MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,

 POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME

             OKAY,
   THE WIVES HAVE JOINED US.
  LADIES, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS.
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.

         SO HERE WE GO.
  LADIES, SINCE YOU FOUND OUT
   THAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
         ARE HAPPILY ON
    THE ROAD TO PARENTHOOD,

          HOW HAS YOUR
    SEX LIFE BEEN AFFECTED?
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
   IT'S BEEN SMOOTH CRUISIN',
     A BIT OF A BUMPY RIDE,

     OR IS THE ROAD PRETTY
 MUCH CLOSED FOR CONSTRUCTION?
           DANIELLE?
  - I SAY IT'S A SMOOTH RIDE.
       - WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - SMOOTH CRUISIN'.

            - YEAH.
           [giggles]
           [applause]
          - ALL RIGHT,
 WE'RE GONNA GO ON TO SAMANTHA.

         - I WOULD SAY
     A BIT OF A BUMPY RIDE.
    - A BIT OF A BUMPY RIDE?
             - YES.
            - YEAH?
          - [giggles]

         - IS IT CAUSE
   YOU'RE KIND OF FAR--YOUR--
       - YEAH, 'CAUSE...
        - YOU'RE EIGHT--
     ARE YOU EIGHT MONTHS?
  - NINE WHOLE ENTIRE MONTHS.

      - WHOO! CAN SOMEBODY
   START BOILIN' SOME WATER?
          - [giggles]
          - 'CAUSE WE
    GOTTA FINISH THIS GAME.

          WE WILL HAVE
     THIS BABY RIGHT HERE.
   DANIEL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   both: BIT OF A BUMPY RIDE.

     [cheers and applause]
           [applause]
         - AND JAYMIE?
 - I WOULD SAY SMOOTH CRUISIN'.

       - SMOOTH CRUISIN'?
  NOW WHAT DID YOU SAY, MATT?
       - SMOOTH CRUISIN'.
  - MATT SAID SMOOTH CRUISIN'.
            - MWAH.
           [applause]

 - I LOVE HOW ALL THE HUSBANDS
        ARE VERY GENTLE
 WHEN THEY REACH OVER TO KISS.
          IT'S LIKE...
      DON'T JAR THE BABY.

ALL RIGHT, LADIES, HOW DID YOUR
HUSBAND COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
     THE LAST TIME I RAISED
         THE WHITE FLAG
     AND SAID, "I GIVE UP"
     WAS WHEN MY WIFE AND I

   WERE ARGUING ABOUT BLANK.
           SAMANTHA?
     - IT WAS OVER A BILL?
 - DID YOU CHARGE UP SOMETHING
    YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO?

        - A LITTLE BIT.
           [laughing]
           - DANIEL,
    WAS IT ABOUT THAT BILL?

        HE SAID COOKING.
           - COOKIN'.
           - COOKING?
 - YEAH, 'CAUSE WE DON'T ARGUE
        BUT WE COOK AND
     WE GO BACK AND FORTH.

     - I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
        - WE DON'T KNOW.
           - JAYMIE.
      - CAN I SAY NOTHING?
     - YOU CAN SAY NOTHING.

 - YEAH, I'M GONNA SAY NOTHING.
   - MATT, DO YOU THINK THAT?
       - SHE'S RIGHT, BUT
    I SAID THE CAMPING TRIP.

           [chuckles]
 - WE DIDN'T ARGUE ABOUT THAT.
       [audience laughs]
   - BUT IT WASN'T REAL BAD.
          SHE'S RIGHT.
     [overlapping chatter]

             YEAH.
        CAN I STILL GO?
           - SHUT UP.
          - [laughing]
     ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
      GO ONTO YOU, DANIEL.

 - MOVING BACK TO LONG ISLAND.
      - OH. IS YOUR FAMILY
        IN LONG ISLAND?
          - OH, YEAH.
             - OH.

        BOY, DID WE NOT
      SEE THAT ONE COMING.
      ROB, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         - I'M HAPPY TO
     MOVE BACK HERE, BUT...

        I THOUGHT IT WAS
      ABOUT THE PREGNANCY.
     - ABOUT THE PREGNANCY.
            - WHAT?
  - WITH YOU SAYING THAT IT'S
  TEN MONTHS IN THE PREGNANCY.

              OH.
      THERE BASICALLY IS.
       - IT'S TEN MONTHS.
        - SO I'M RIGHT.
        - YES, AND HE--
         - ABSOLUTELY.

     - YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
          THERE WE GO.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
        FINAL QUESTION.
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBANDS SAY
IS THE MOST BIZARRE FOOD CRAVING

YOU'VE HAD WHILE BEING PREGNANT?
       ALL RIGHT, JAYMIE?
       - I HAVE A CRAVING
         FOR CHOCOLATE.

      - LOT OF CHOCOLATE?
        - YEAH, LIKE THE
BROWNIE OBSESSION FROM FRIDAY'S.
     - I EAT THAT TOO, AND
  I'M NOT EVEN PREGNANT, GIRL.

          I LOVE THAT.
         THAT IS GOOD.
           ALL RIGHT,
     MATT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - BROWNIE OBSESSION.

          - BABY...MM.
          - [giggles]
          - DANIELLE?

     - THE ONLY THING WEIRD
        I GUESS WOULD BE
    FLUFF AND PEANUT BUTTER.
     - ROB, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     - I SAID CANDY, BUT...
            - CANDY.

      - THAT'S NOT WEIRD.
  - NO, I KNOW IT'S NOT WEIRD.
    BUT I COULDN'T THINK OF
       ANYTHING TOO MUCH.
     - ALL RIGHT, SAMANTHA?

      - IN THE BEGINNING,
        I WAS CRAVING...
        LEMON WITH SALT.
             - MM.
      YOU LIKE THAT SALTY?
    - YES, IT'S REALLY GOOD.

           - REALLY?
             - YES.
           - OH, WOW.
    DANIEL, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     LEMON JUICE, AND SALT,
       AND PEPPER, YEAH!

OKAY, LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
      DANIEL AND SAMANTHA,
       YOU GUYS ARE TIED
      WITH MATT AND JAYMIE
        FOR FIRST PLACE.

   SO LADIES, IT IS YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.
        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
         ARE YOU READY?
           all: YES.

      - OKAY, HERE WE GO.
    IF AN ADULT TOY COMPANY
  CAME UP WITH AN ERECTOR SET
 FOR YOUR HUSBAND'S LOVE CRANE,

    HOW HIGH COULD IT REACH?
       ABOUT SIX STORIES,
 BETWEEN SIX AND NINE STORIES,

    OR AT LEAST TEN STORIES?
           DANIELLE?
        - AT LEAST TEN,
  BECAUSE HIM AND HIS BROTHER

   SAY THAT "THEY MEASURED."
         SO I'LL SAY...
       [audience laughs]
            - WHOO!
           ALL RIGHT.

           SAMANTHA?
     - I WOULD SAY BETWEEN
     SIX AND NINE STORIES.
     UM, I'M JUST GUESSING.

         I DON'T KNOW.
          - [laughing]
    I LOVE THAT, ALL RIGHT.
            JAYMIE?
  - I WOULD SAY AT LEAST TEN.

        - AT LEAST TEN?
              WOW!
         SO WE'RE GONNA
   GO ONTO THE NEXT QUESTION.
   LADIES, HUSBANDS AND WIVES
 CAN SHARE EVERYTHING TOGETHER,

     EXCEPT BEING PREGNANT.
 SO WHAT PART OF THE PREGNANCY
         WOULD YOU LOVE
  TO PASS OFF TO YOUR HUSBAND?

           SAMANTHA?
      - UM, THE INABILITY
  TO GET COMFORTABLE IN SLEEP.
   I FALL ASLEEP SITTING UP.
           - REALLY?

        - AND THEN WHEN
   I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING,
           I'M LIKE,
     LAYING DOWN SOMEWHERE.
          - [laughing]
  LIKE OUT BACK BY THE GARAGE.

         WHERE IS IT--
     WHERE ARE YOU LAYING?
             OKAY.
            JAYMIE?
     - I'D SAY BEING SICK.

      LIKE, NOT BEING ABLE
        TO EAT ANYTHING,
 NOT BEING ABLE TO LOOK AT FOOD
        AND SMELL FOOD.
           - GOT YOU.
           DANIELLE?

           - I'D SAY
    NOT HAVING CUTE CLOTHES.
  - WERE YOU MORE FORM-FITTING
       AND LITTLE SHORTS,
        BEFORE YOU GOT--
  THAT'S HOW YOU GOT PREGNANT.

       WITH THE CLOTHES.
         - OH, EXACTLY.
            - YEAH.
      THOSE CUTE CLOTHES.
    LADIES, HERE WE GO WITH
       OUR NEXT QUESTION.

 WHAT IS THE STRANGEST ARTICLE
 OF CLOTHING YOU HAVE EVER WORN
   WHILE YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
  WERE GETTING DOWN AND DIRTY?
            JAYMIE?

   - I WOULD SAY THIS LITTLE
       SCHOOLGIRL OUTFIT
        THING HE BOUGHT.
   - I BET YOU THAT'S, LIKE,

     ONE OF THE TOP-SELLING
       OUTFITS, THAT ONE.
           DANIELLE?
       - A BATHING SUIT?
        THAT'S THE ONLY
  STRANGE THING I WOULD WEAR.

     - ALL RIGHT, SAMANTHA?
   - THE STRANGEST THING WAS
         A CHURCH SUIT
          - [laughing]

  SO THE WHOLE TIME IN CHURCH,
   HE WAS GETTING TURNED ON?
       [audience laughs]
  AND YOU THOUGHT WHEN HE SAID
 "HALLELUJAH" IT WAS ABOUT HIM.

           ALL RIGHT.
         WELL, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION,
        IT IS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

            COMPLETE
     THIS SENTENCE, LADIES.
     THE ONE PHYSICAL TRAIT
        OF MY HUSBAND'S
    THAT I PRAY THAT MY BABY
 DOES NOT INHERIT IS HIS BLANK.

   AND I BET MY HUSBAND HOPES
OUR CHILD DOESN'T GET MY BLANK.
           DANIELLE?
      - I'D SAY HIS FEET.
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT MY BABY GIRL
   TO HAVE TOO BIG OF A FEET.

  - ROB'S FEET ARE REALLY BIG?
            - YEAH.
   - AND THEN WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- HE KNOWS I DON'T LIKE MY NOSE,
  SO KNOW HE'S GONNA SAY THAT.

          - SAMANTHA?
          - FOR HIM--
 THE ONE TRAIT FROM MY HUSBAND
       WOULD BE HIS HEAD.
          - [laughing]
  WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIS HEAD?

           - JUST...
          IT'S JUST...
 - THAT'S THE SAME MEASUREMENT
   YOU USED FOR HIS STORIES.
THAT YOU'RE USING FOR HIS HEAD.

         SO, AND WHAT--
      - OH, AND FOR ME...
       IT MIGHT BE THE--
       MAYBE MY FOREHEAD?
        - YOUR FOREHEAD?

       - YEAH, HE THINKS
      MY FOREHEAD IS BIG.
          - [laughing]
             OKAY.
       ALL RIGHT, JAYMIE?

          - THE FIRST
     WOULD BE HIS BALDNESS.
            - OKAY.
      - AND THEN FOR ME...
        I WANNA SAY THAT
    HE WOULD THINK NOTHING.

    - HE WOULD SAY NOTHING.
      - KNOWING HIM, YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
 WE'RE GONNA SEE JUST HOW WELL

         THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
  AND FOR MORE NEWLYWED GAME,

 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE.
      SO HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
           GENTLEMEN,
    IF AN ADULT TOY COMPANY

  CAME UP WITH AN ERECTOR SET
      FOR YOUR LOVE CRANE,
     HOW HIGH DID YOUR WIFE
      SAY IT COULD REACH?
       ABOUT SIX STORIES,
 BETWEEN SIX AND NINE STORIES,

    OR AT LEAST TEN STORIES.
              ROB?
    - WELL, THAT CRANE WOULD
 HAVE TO GO UP TO A SKYSCRAPER.
             - OH!
      - GO UP TEN STORIES.

              TEN.
     - ALL RIGHT, DANIELLE,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     AT LEAST TEN STORIES.
     [cheers and applause]

           I LOVE IT,
WE'RE GONNA GO ONTO YOU, DANIEL.
        - AT LEAST TEN.
    - AT LEAST TEN STORIES.
        I LOVE THE SMILE
  THAT COMES ON EVERYBODY'S...

    ON THE HUSBAND'S FACES.
   SAMANTHA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
           - UH--OH.
    - BETWEEN SIX AND NINE.

    - SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
         THE QUESTION.
       [audience laughs]
     SHE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND

          - [laughing]
          GOOD NIGHT!
     GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

      SAMANTHA, YOU DIDN'T
    UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION?
        - NO, I DIDN'T.
      - YOU DIDN'T UNDER--
           IT'S OKAY.

           [laughing]
             MATT?
     - I'D LIKE TO THINK I
 CAN DO THE ACTION OF THE TEN,

  BUT I WANNA SAY SIX TO NINE.
         - SIX TO NINE?
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, JAYMIE?
          - I SAID...
        - AT LEAST TEN.

       I DON'T THINK YOU
    UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION.
     [cheers and applause]
   GENTLEMEN, NEXT QUESTION.

       HUSBANDS AND WIVES
 CAN SHARE EVERYTHING TOGETHER,
     EXCEPT BEING PREGNANT.
 SO WHAT PART OF THE PREGNANCY
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY

         SHE WOULD LOVE
      TO PASS OFF TO YOU?
            DANIEL?
     - BEING UNCOMFORTABLE.

      SLEEPIN' SITTING UP,
    THE BABY MOVING AROUND.
   JUST BEING UNCOMFORTABLE.
    - AND HOW DO YOU SLEEP?
        - I SLEEP FINE.

    SLEEP COMFORTABLY, YES.
  - WE'RE DOING A HEAD KNOCK.
           [applause]

            - MATT?
   - I GUESS IT'D BE LINES--
       ALONG THE LINES OF
    BEING UNCOMFORTABLE TOO.
       I MEAN, SHE'S BEEN

     HAVING A LOT OF ISSUES
    WITH HER BACK AND STUFF.
     SO CARRYING THE BABY,
   MAKING HER UNCOMFORTABLE.
   - WHAT'D YOU SAY, JAYMIE?

      - I SAID BEING SICK.
       I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
    NOT EVEN MARRIED TO ME.
           [laughing]
             - ROB.

         - I KNOW THAT
   SHE WANTS TO HAVE A DRINK.
   JUST TO, LIKE, RELAX HER.
   JUST TO CALM HERSELF DOWN.
WHICH IS NORMAL, IT'S ALL GOOD.
            - OKAY.

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - I SAID THE CLOTHES.

      - WE GOT THIS LITTLE
 SCHOOLGIRL OUTFIT THAT I LIKE.

 HAD ALWAYS CALLED OREGON HOME.
        UNTIL I GOT A JOB
        IN THE BIG APPLE.

     ADJUSTING TO CITY LIFE
        WAS HARD FOR ME.
     AND BECOMING A FULLTIME
INDOOR CAT WASN'T EASY FOR ATTI.
      BUT WE HAD EACH OTHER

      AND HE HAD PURINA CAT CHOW
                   INDOOR.
     HE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.
    AND I KNEW HE WAS GETTING
      EVERYTHING HE NEEDED

    TO STAY HEALTHY INDOORS.
  AND AFTER A COUPLE OF WEEKS,
  I KNEW WE WERE FINALLY HOME!
