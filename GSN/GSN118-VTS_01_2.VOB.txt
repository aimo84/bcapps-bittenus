      DANIEL AND SAMANTHA,
       YOU GUYS ARE TIED
        FOR FIRST PLACE
     WITH MATT AND JAYMIE.
    YOU BOTH HAVE 20 POINTS.

         BUT IT IS TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION,
  IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS,
     IT IS ANYBODY'S GAME.
    COUPLES, ARE YOU READY?

           all: YES.
    - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
   THE ONE PHYSICAL TRAIT OF
    MY HUSBAND'S THAT I PRAY

        MY BABY DOES NOT
     INHERIT IS HIS BLANK.
   AND I BET MY HUSBAND HOPES
OUR CHILD DOESN'T GET MY BLANK.
              ROB?

 - I WOULD SAY THAT SHE DOESN'T
   WANT THE BABY TO GET MY...
       HEIGHT, PROBABLY.
            - OKAY.
      - AND THEN, I'D SAY
       PROBABLY HER NOSE.

  - DANIELLE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        - I SAID HIS...
   - YOUR FEET, BUT HER NOSE.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.

           [applause]
    SO RIGHT NOW, YOU'RE IN
  THE LEAD, ROB AND DANIELLE.
           - FINALLY.
          - [laughing]

       ALL RIGHT, DANIEL,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - MAYBE MY HEAD.
        AND ONE THING...
        MAYBE HER HEAD.

         I DON'T KNOW.
       [audience laughs]
      - WHAT'S THE MATTER
     WITH SAMANTHA'S HEAD?
    - SHE HAS THE BANGS, SO
 IT'S PERFECTLY FINE RIGHT NOW.

           [laughing]
     - SO IT'S OKAY IF YOUR
 BABY GIRL IS BORN WITH BANGS?
       [audience laughs]

  SAMANTHA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   THE HEAD AND THE FOREHEAD.
 YOU BOTH GOT THEM BOTH RIGHT.

           [applause]
            I MEAN,
     YOU GUYS HAVE TO KNOW,
     ONE DAY, BIG HEADS ARE
         GONNA PAY OFF.

             MATT?
     SO YOU WOULD NEED BOTH
TO TIE WITH DANIEL AND SAMANTHA.
     - I THINK SHE WOULDN'T
   WANT OUR BABY TO MY HAIR,

        OR LACK THEREOF.
           [laughing]
          AND I WOULD
      SAY NOTHING FOR HER.
            - OKAY.
  ALL RIGHT, THAT'S SO SWEET.

   JAYMIE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
 - I SAID BALDNESS AND NOTHING.
    - BALDNESS AND NOTHING!
    YOU GOT THEM BOTH RIGHT!
       COUPLE NUMBER TWO
    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE.

      WHICH MEANS WE HAVE
    TO GO TO A TIE-BREAKER.
        BEFORE THE SHOW,
      WE ASKED EACH COUPLE
        TO PREDICT WHAT
  THEIR FINAL SCORE WOULD BE.

        THE COUPLE WHOSE
    PREDICTION COMES CLOSEST
      TO THE ACTUAL SCORE
       WITHOUT GOING OVER
      WILL BE THE WINNER.

    YOU BOTH HAVE 50 POINTS.
    SO WE'RE GOING TO START
   WITH YOU, MATT AND JAYMIE.
      WHAT'D YOU PUT DOWN?

    YOU PUT DOWN 45 POINTS.
             OKAY.
    SO DANIEL AND SAMANTHA,
     WHAT DID YOU PUT DOWN?
           50 POINTS!

      DANIEL AND SAMANTHA,
        CONGRATULATIONS!
      YOU ARE OUR WINNERS!
   YOU ARE GOING TO ANTIGUA!

           - HI, YOU.

    WE HAVE SENT YOUR WIVES
           BACKSTAGE
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
         ARE YOU READY,
           GENTLEMEN?

            - READY.
             - YES.
        - YOU'RE READY,

      - OKAY, HERE WE GO.
           - I THINK.
- GENTLEMEN, IF YOU WERE MAKING
 A LIFE-SIZE DOLL OF YOUR WIFE,
    AND WANTED TO RE-CREATE
     THE FEEL OF HER BOOBS,

      WHAT WOULD YOU FILL
   THE DOLL'S FUN BAGS WITH?
        WALTER, PUDDING,
            OR CLAY?
             ADAM?

           - PUDDING.
           - PUDDING?
  - BECAUSE I LIKE CHOCOLATE.
             - AH.
      - AND IT JUST SEEMS
        NICE AND MILKY.

       - NICE AND MILKY.
           - [laughs]
            - OKAY.
             CHASE?

            I MEAN--
           - [laughs]
         YES, THEY ARE.
           ALL RIGHT.

      WHAT ABOUT YOU, ED?
    - I HAVE TO SAY PUDDING,
             SURE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

 - JUST THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY.
IT SOUNDS LIKE, [as Bill Cosby]
     VERY GOOD CONSISTENCY
        IN THE PUDDING.
       WITH THE PUDDING,

        WITH THE BOOBS,
     AND THE PUDDING, OKAY.
     AND OUR NEXT QUESTION,
           GENTLEMEN.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

        IF A UNIVERSITY
   ASKED YOUR WIFE TO CREATE
        A NEW DEPARTMENT
        FOR THEIR SCHOOL
       BASED ON SOMETHING
     SHE IS OBSESSED WITH,

     THEN SHE WOULD BECOME
         THE FIRST-EVER
  PROFESSOR OF "BLANK-OLOGY."
             CHASE?

   - UH, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
      GETTING READY-OLOGY,
   BECAUSE IT TAKES FOREVER.
           - DOES IT?

    - IT TAKES A LONG TIME.
          - OKAY, ED?
- I'M GONNA GO WITH SPICE-OLOGY.
         - SPICE-OLOGY?

   - BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO FULL
    CABINETS IN OUR KITCHEN,
      JUST FULL OF SPICES.
            - OKAY.
             ADAM?

        - I'M GONNA SAY
        COMPLAIN-OLOGY.
BECAUSE SHE HEARS ME COMPLAININ'
         ALL THE TIME,
     AND SHE JUST FIGURES,
         WHAT THE HELL,

 SHE MAY AS WELL COMPLAIN, TOO,
              SO--
        - OKAY, GOT YOU.
   FINAL QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
    IF YOUR WIFE WAS HOSTING
         A DINNER PARTY

        FOR ALL THE MEN
SHE HAS SLEPT WITH IN HER LIFE,
  NOT INCLUDING HER, HOW MANY
 PLACE SETTINGS WOULD SHE NEED?
              ED?

            - UM...
   - YOU GOT A LOT OF FIGURES
         IN YOUR HEAD?
       - I'M TRYIN' TO--
 YEAH, I'M--IT'S, UH, CALCULUS.

          - OH, G--OH!
             - UM--
           - OH, WOW.
       - NO, I'M KIDDING,
          I'M KIDDING.

             - OH.
      - I'M GONNA GO, 20.
             - 20.
             - YES.
- SHE'D HAVE 20 PLACE SETTINGS--

      - I'M GONNA SAY, 20.
    - NOT INCLUDING HERSELF.
            - SURE.
         - OKAY. ADAM?
  - SHE WAS HOME FOR A WHILE,
         SHE LEFT HOME,

       SHE'S A GOOD GIRL,
         I'LL SAY FOUR.
            - FOUR?
     - SO WHAT I THINK OF,
  I THINK SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL.
       - YOU THINK SHE--

- YOU THINK SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL.
    KEEP THAT IN YOUR HEAD.
          DEFINITELY.
             CHASE?
       - I'M PRETTY SURE

          IT'S FIVE...
  BECAUSE, LIKE MOST COUPLES,
           WE'VE HAD
    THAT AWFUL CONVERSATION
     THAT EVERY COUPLE HAS.

- SO YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH FIVE.
             OKAY.
           ALL RIGHT.
  FELLAS, THANK YOU. NICE JOB.
       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,

       BECAUSE THE COUPLE
      WITH THE MOST POINTS
AT THE END OF THE GAME WILL WIN
  A FANTASTIC SECOND HONEYMOON
           TO TORTOLA
 IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

         CHECK IT OUT.
     LONG BAY BEACH RESORT
          AND VILLAS,

     EXCEPT FOR THE GUESTS.
     LONG BAY BEACH RESORT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         WELCOME BACK.

NOW WHILE YOU WERE GONE, I ASKED
 YOUR HUSBANDS THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
      IS WORTH FIVE POINTS

         SO HERE WE GO,
            LADIES.
   IF YOUR HUSBAND WAS MAKING
    A LIFE-SIZE DOLL OF YOU,
   AND HE WANTED TO RE-CREATE
    THE FEEL OF YOUR BOOBS,

        WHAT DID HE SAY
 HE'D FILL YOUR FUN BAGS WITH,
            PUDDING,
             WATER,

            OR CLAY?
             NANCY?
- UM, THEY'RE VERY, UH, SQUISHY,
      LIKE WATER BALLOONS.

            - YEAH?
        - SO, UH, YEAH.
    HE'S MADE THAT, KIND OF,
     THAT REFERENCE BEFORE.
            - OKAY.
     ADAM, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

        HE SAID PUDDING.
           both: AW.
            - SORRY.
    - TARA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

            - WATER,
 BECAUSE MY HUSBAND ALWAYS SAYS
 THAT MY BOOBS ARE VERY BOUNCY,
   AND WATER BALLOONS BOUNCE.
            - OKAY.
           - [laughs]

            - CHASE?
        HE SAID PUDDING.
             - AW.
  - CATHERINE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - PUDDING WOULD BE FUN TO USE
        ON THE OUTSIDE,
        BUT I WOULD SAY
      THE INSIDE IS WATER.
  - THE INSIDE WOULD BE WATER.

    - ED, YOU LOOK CONFUSED.
     SHOW ME WHAT YOU SAID.
           - [laughs]
- I SAID PUDDING INSIDE AND OUT.
              SO--

            - OKAY.
   LADIES, OUR NEXT QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
IF A UNIVERSITY ASKED YOUR WIFE
   TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT

   FOR THEIR SCHOOL, BASED ON
SOMETHING SHE IS OBSESSED WITH.
     THEN SHE WOULD BECOME
         THE FIRST-EVER
  PROFESSOR OF "BLANK-OLOGY."

             TARA?
       - I WOULDN'T KNOW
        HOW TO WORD IT,
  BUT IT WOULD HAVE SOMETHING
  TO DO WITH HAIR AND MAKEUP.

     SO COSMOTOLOGY, MAYBE.
       - OF COSMOTOLOGY?
         - COSMOTOLOGY.
            - OKAY.
- BECAUSE I'M OBSESSED WITH IT.
   - WHAT'D YOUR HUSBAND SAY?

  HE SAID GETTING READY-OLOGY.
           - NO GOOD?
          AW, COME ON!
      THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID,
            YOU SAID
     SHE TAKES A LONG TIME
         TO GET READY.
      - THAT IS VERY TRUE.

      - BEAUTY TAKES TIME.
      - IT DOES TAKE TIME.
 THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.
        - THAT--EXACTLY.
       - YOU'RE SAYING--

           CATHERINE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I'LL SAY VOCOLOGY.
            VOCAL--
        - VO--VOCOLOGY?
      - SINGING, KARAOKE.

   - OH, YOU LIKE DOIN' THAT.
     - THAT KIND OF STUFF.
              YES.
            - OKAY.
     ED, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     - I SAID SPICE-OLOGY.
             - OH!
 - THAT'S TRUE, I LIKE COOKING.
     - WHICH IS APPARENTLY
   WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SAID.

            - NANCY?
    - UM, I WILL HAVE TO SAY
        FACEBOOK-OLOGY.
            - YEAH?
       - I'M ALWAYS--YES.

  - YOU'RE ALWAYS ON FACEBOOK.
            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.
    ADAM, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    HE SAID COMPLAIN-OLOGY.

- WITH WORK, AND THIS AND THAT.
             - OH!
      - WITH--ABOUT WORK.
            - OKAY.
            - YEAH.

        - LOOK, LADIES,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
      IF YOU WERE HOSTING
         A DINNER PARTY
    FOR ALL THE MEN YOU HAVE
    SLEPT WITH IN YOUR LIFE,

        NOT INCLUDING--
    NOT INCLUDING YOURSELF,
    HOW MANY PLACE SETTINGS
DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY YOU'D NEED?

   CATHERINE, YOU ARE BURYING
    YOUR FACE IN YOUR HANDS.
         SO I AM GOING
       TO START WITH YOU.
       - [clears throat]

       OKAY, I'LL SAY 18.
 - 18? A PLACE-SETTING FOR 18,
    NOT INCLUDING YOURSELF?
          - YES. YES.
    - ALL RIGHT. OKAY, WELL,

     ED, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - I SAID 20,
  BUT I COUNTED MYSELF TWICE.
         - OH! I KNEW,
      I WAS GONNA SAY 20!

              OH!
        - I KNOW, GIRL,
           I GOT YOU,

    'CAUSE IT'S A FINE LINE
   BETWEEN 18 AND 20. I KNOW.
           - [laughs]
    - I GOT YOU. I GOT YOU.
           - EXACTLY.
            EXACTLY.

           [laughter]
      - ALL RIGHT, NANCY?
- UM, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY FOUR.

         - FOUR? OKAY.
             - YES.
    UH, LONG...YOU KNOW, UH,
      LONG RELATIONSHIPS.
       - ALL RIGHT. FOUR.

   - ADAM, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        ADAM SAID FOUR!
     - YOU'RE LUCKY, BABY,
          YOU'RE LUCKY

         YOU'RE LUCKY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
          QUITE GOOD.
     TARA, WHAT'S GOIN' ON
       BEHIND THAT SMILE?

     - FIVE. THAT IS MY...
       THAT IS MY NUMBER.
        - THAT IS YOUR--
   - IF HE SAID ANYTHING ELSE
           DIFFERENT,
      I'LL BE VERY UPSET.

         - OKAY. CHASE,
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING DIFFERENT?
         FIVE, HE SAID!
              AW!

           ALL RIGHT,
         FIVIN' IT UP!
          HERE WE GO!

             OKAY,

       MEGA-LASTING HOLD.
     I'M--I'M USUALLY LIKE,
         OKAY, REALLY?

         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

       IF MY HUSBAND HAD
   THE POWER TO BE INVISIBLE,
   THE FIRST PLACE HE'D VISIT
       WOULD BE "BLANK."
            - TARA?

        - IN THE SHOWER,
      WHILE I'M SHOWERING.
  THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW AREAS
  THAT I NEED MY PRIVATE TIME,
     AND HE'S ALWAYS TRYIN'
  TO INVADE MY PRIVATE SPACE.

          - I GOT YOU.
           CATHERINE?
         - I WOULD SAY
  HE'D TRY TO GO IN THE BACK.
             - OH!

   I--I WOULD--I WOULDA NEVER
   THOUGHT OF LOOKIN' AT ED.
         - OH, REALLY?
       - OKAY, SO THAT'S
    WHERE ED WOULD BE, FOR--

      IF HE WAS INVISIBLE
             - YES.
           OH, YEAH.
            - OKAY.
             NANCY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - UM, I WOULD SAY
      HE WOULD TRY TO, UH,
   VISIT WHERE HIS SON LIVES,
      TO SEE HOW HE LIVES,
    AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE,
AND HOW WELL HE'S TAKEN CARE OF.

 - IS THAT A SEXUAL REFERENCE,
          OR IS THAT--
           - NO-O-O!
  - OH, HE'D VISIT--OH, OKAY.
           - HIS SON.
       - WE'RE SO USED TO

    DOIN' SEXUAL INNUENDOS--
           - NO-O-O.
       AND WHEN YOU WENT,
   VISIT WHERE HIS SON LIVES,
           I'M LIKE,
   WHERE HIS SON LIVE? OKAY.

          - [laughter]
   - WHERE DOES HIS SON LIVE?
       - IN LONG ISLAND,
  WE LIVE IN NEW JERSEY. YES.

    - IN LONG ISLAND, OKAY,
SO HE'D GO TO WHERE HIS SON IS.
         - YEAH. YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
         NEXT QUESTION.

          LADIES LOVE
     A GOOD RETURN POLICY.
     SO IF YOU COULD RETURN
ONE PART OF YOUR HUSBAND'S BODY,
    AND GET A HIGHER-QUALITY
          REPLACEMENT

    AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE,
     WHAT BODY PART OF HIS
      WOULD YOU SEND BACK?
           CATHERINE?

     - WELL, IT'S MY FAULT,
    BUT I WOULD SAY HIS GUT.
 - SO THE SPICE GIRL MAKES TOO
MUCH STUFF FOR HIM TO EAT, HUH?
           ALL RIGHT.
             NANCY?

   - MY HUSBAND IS BEAUTIFUL,
  BUT HE HAS THIS FROWN LINE,
          RIGHT HERE.
           - UH-HUH.
     HE'S ALWAYS FROWNING,

       SO I WOULD GET RID
      OF THAT FROWN LINE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            - 100%.
            - TARA?

       - DOES HAIR COUNT
        AS A BODY PART?
      - I THINK SO, YEAH.
              YES.
 - I LOVE MY HUSBAND TO DEATH,
      BUT HE'S VERY HAIRY.

  AND IT CAN GET REALLY GROSS
         IN OUR SHOWER.
           - UH-HUH.
       - SO I WOULD SAY,
        LESS BODY HAIR.

            - OKAY.
          SO HIS HAIR.
        LADIES, HERE IS
      THE BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.

           EACH PART
      IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
         MY HUBBY AND I
   WILL BE TOGETHER FOREVER.

   WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW LONG
 IT WILL TAKE ME TO GET USED TO
     HIS HABIT OF "BLANK."
     AND HIM TO GET USED TO
      MY HABIT OF "BLANK."

             NANCY?
             - OOH.
  UH, BESIDES MY COMPLAINING,
      HE ALWAYS COMPLAINS
        ABOUT WORK, TOO.

    CONSTANTLY COMPLAINING.
    HE HAS HIS OWN BUSINESS,
    HE'S ALWAYS COMPLAINING,
     ALSO NOT ENOUGH WORK,
   AND I GUESS HE'LL HAVE TO
    GET USED TO MINE, ALSO.

 - YOU GUYS MUST BE SO MUCH FUN
         AT YOUR HOUSE.
   - OH, WE LOVE EACH OTHER.
       - NOT ENOUGH WORK,
TOO MUCH WORK, TOO LITTLE WORK,

           I'M TIRED.
           - [laugh
       - ALL RIGHT, TARA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
             - OH,

   I LOVE MY HUSBAND SO MUCH,
     BUT HE NEVER PICKS UP
         AFTER HIMSELF,
        SO IT WOULD TAKE
       A LIFETIME FOR ME

       TO GET USED TO HIM
NEVER PICKING UP AFTER HIMSELF.
           - MM-HMM.
   - AND IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
MY TAKING SO LONG TO GET READY.

       - OKAY. CATHERINE?
       - I WOULD SAY HIS,
           UM, O.C.D.
   HE'S A CLEANER. BIG TIME.
           - UH-HUH.
            - BUT...

  HE WOULD HAVE TO GET USED TO
        ME BEING MESSY,
        'CAUSE IT'S JUST
       NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
     - IT'S NOT HAPPENIN',
        YOU PICKIN' UP.

      - I'M NOT CLEANIN'.
     I DON'T LIKE CLEANING,
     I HATE WASHIN' DISHES.
         I DO MY BEST,
          AND HE JUST
         GOES OVER ME.

      - YOU'RE JUST LIKE--
  - HE JUST CLEANS RIGHT AFTER
       I FINISH CLEANING.
      - YOU'RE JUST LIKE,
         I'M THE COOK,
  I'M THE SPICE GIRL, I COOK.

 - EXACTLY, I COOK, YOU CLEAN.
       GO AHEAD, PLEASE.
- YOU CLEAN, DO EVERYTHING ELSE.
           - EXACTLY.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

       NOW, WE HAVE SENT
      THE WIVES BACKSTAGE
  SO WE CAN ASK THEIR HUSBANDS
        SOME QUESTIONS.

   ARE YOU READY, GENTLEMEN?
        - WE ARE READY.
     - ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.
           GENTLEMEN,
    WHAT WAS THE LAST THING

           YOUR WIFE
     FAKED HER WAY THROUGH?
     AN INTEREST IN SPORTS,
 AN INTELLECTUAL CONVERSATION,

     OR AN INTENSE ORGASM?
             JOHN?
   - I WOULD SAY SHE PROBABLY

     FAKED HER WAY THROUGH
       A SPORTING EVENT.
     THAT'S THE ONLY FAKING
           SHE DOES.
          - OH, OKAY.
        I GOT YOU, JOHN.

           ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT ABOUT YOU, ANDY?
        - THAT WOULD BE
     AN INTEREST IN SPORTS.
          DEFINITELY.

    - AN INTEREST IN SPORTS.
   AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, RAVEN?
         - SHE DOESN'T
      REALLY LIKE SPORTS,
   SO I'D REALLY THINK SHE'D
  GO WITH FAKING WITH SPORTS,

     'CAUSE I KIND OF LIKE
  TALKING ABOUT RACING, AND...
     - OKAY, SO IT'S PRETTY
     UNANIMOUS, GENTLEMEN.
        THEY--THE WIVES
 FAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH SPORTS.

    OKAY, OUR NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE,
           GENTLEMEN.
    MY WIFE MAY BE THE MOST
    LOVEABLE WOMAN ON EARTH,

       BUT I STILL THINK
 I'M THE ONLY MAN ON THE PLANET
   WHO COULD LOVE HER BLANK.
             ANDY?

   - YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA SAY
   I'M THE ONLY MAN ON EARTH
         WHO COULD LOVE
       HER NOSE TRIMMING.
 - I GOT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION.
       HER NOSE TRIMMING?

        - NO--OH, SORRY.
    I'M JUST FIDGETING HERE.
            - OKAY.
       I LIKE YOUR HANDS.
   YOU THINK WITH YOUR HANDS.

     RAVEN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - MAYBE WHENEVER
    I SEE HER IN THE SHOWER,
      SHAVING HER ARMPITS
         OR SOMETNG.

   SHE DOESN'T REALLY LIKE IT
        WHEN I DO THAT,
        BUT IT HAPPENS--
           VERY OF--
        NOT VERY OFTEN,
              BUT,

           YOU KNOW.
           - [laughs]
              HMM.
       LITTLE SLIP THERE.
           ALL RIGHT.
   AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, JOHN?

 - I'M GONNA HAVE TO MOVE AWAY
    FROM THIS THEME OF, UM,
      YOU KNOW, BODY HAIR.
            - OKAY.
            [laughs]

           THANK YOU.
 - BUT I WOULD SAY THAT THE ONE
  THING THAT I LOVE ABOUT HER
        THAT NO ONE ELSE
      COULD LOVE ABOUT HER

     IS HER HABIT OF BEING
       PERPETUALLY LATE.
        SHE MAY NOT EVEN
      COME OUT HERE TODAY.
         I'M NOT SURE.

          - I GOT YOU.
     NOW, THIS IS BURNING.
        THIS QUESTION'S
      BURNING IN MY MIND.

      I LOVE YOUR OUTFIT.
      YOU HAVE TO EXPLAIN.
         - IT'S A KILT,
      WHICH I WORE ON MY--
      - CAN YOU STAND UP?
          I WANT TO--

         I HAVE TO SEE.
   THIS IS, LIKE, SO AWESOME.
    OKAY, SO THIS IS A KILT.
         - IT'S A KILT.
   - AND THIS IS--'CAUSE IT'S
  KIND OF TUXEDO-LIKE UP HERE.

            - IT IS.
          VERY FORMAL.
 - AND IT'S VERY--CAN YOU TURN
     AND SHOW THE AUDIENCE?
          I LOVE THIS.
         THIS IS GREAT.

         LOOK AT THAT.
           [humming]
            [laughs]
           I LOVE IT.

   EVERYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING.

            - OKAY.

     WHAT'D YOU SAY, RAVEN?

     AN INTEREST IN SPORTS.
             - YAY!

        I AM SO EXCITED.
  I HEAR YOU HAVE A LITTLE BIT
   OF NEWS TO SHARE WITH US.

HUSBAND COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

    MY WIFE MAY BE THE MOST
    LOVEABLE WOMAN ON EARTH,
       BUT I STILL THINK
 I'M THE ONLY MAN ON THE PLANET
   WHO COULD LOVE HER BLANK.

             TONI?
         - I WOULD SAY
       PICKING MY NAILS?
     - PICKING YOUR NAILS?

            - YEAH.
    - YOU DO IT QUITE A LOT?
      - YEAH. IT'S, LIKE,
  NOT A VERY ATTRACTIVE HABIT.

   - OH, JUST RANDOM THINGS,
            I GUESS.

            - OKAY.
     RAVEN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     SHAVING YOUR ARMPITS.

             HELLO!

        <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
  HELLO, FELLA HOW ARE YOU?
  - DOING GREAT. HOW ARE YOU?
       - I'M DOING GREAT.

          NOW WE HAVE
   SENT YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE
           SO WE CAN
    ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.
          SO LET'S GET
      RIGHT INTO IT, GUYS.

          NOW THAT YOU
    AND YOUR WIFE ARE A DUO,
        HOW OFTEN DO YOU
  WORK ON YOUR SOLO PROJECTS?
          WHEN YOU'RE
      ALONE IN THE STUDIO,

     ONLY WHEN YOU HAVEN'T
  PLAYED TOGETHER IN A WHILE,
   OR NEVER BECAUSE YOUR WIFE
DRAINS ALL YOUR CREATIVE JUICES?
           [laughter]

            ARNOLD?
     - ONLY WHEN WE HAVEN'T
  PLAYED TOGETHER IN A WHILE.
            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.

          - ALL RIGHT.
           - [laughs]
            - JAMES?
     - ONLY WHEN WE HAVEN'T
  PLAYED TOGETHER IN A WHILE.

         - OKAY, CHRIS?
      - I THINK I'M GONNA
         GO FOR NEVER.
         - WITH NEVER?

     - WHEN WE'RE TOGETHER,
      WE HAVE GOOD TIMES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.
       WHAT COLOR FLOWERS
         DID YOUR WIFE

      CARRY DOWN THE AISLE
      ON YOUR WEDDING DAY?
             JAMES?
  - I'M GONNA SAY WHITE ROSES.
         - WHITE ROSES?
            - YEAH.

       - OKAY, BEAUTIFUL.
             CHRIS?
    - I'M GONNA GO FOR A MIX
 OF GREEN AND PURPLEY FLOWERS.
          - [laughing]
       GREEN AND PURPLEY.

            - YEAH.
 THAT'S TECHNICAL TERMS THERE.
        - OKAY, ARNOLD?
       - THAT'S ACTUALLY
     A VERY GOOD QUESTION.

    I'M GONNA GO WITH YELLOW
'CAUSE THAT'S HER FAVORITE COLOR
 AND I HONESTLY DON'T REMEMBER.
            - OH...
   - SO DON'T TELL HER THAT.

- OF COURSE I'M GONNA TELL HER,
   WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
     - AWESOME, FANTASTIC.
    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
         THEY SAY THAT
     PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE,
          BUT WHOEVER
    CAME UP WITH THAT PHRASE

     CLEARLY NEVER MET MY
    WIFE'S RELATIVE, BLANK.
             CHRIS?
         - I'M GONNA GO
        WITH HER MOTHER.

         - HER MOTHER.
            - YEAH.
    - TELL US ABOUT HER MOM,
        WHAT'S HER NAME?
         - UH, DEBORAH.
           - DEBORAH.

     SHE'S LOVELY BUT, UH,
  SHE LIKES TO GET THINGS DONE
          AND GET THEM
         DONE HER WAY.
        - OKAY, ARNOLD?

         - HER FATHER.
             - YES.
       - WHAT'S HIS NAME?
        - UH, IT'S JOHN.
            - JOHN.

    - I HOPE 'CAUSE, AGAIN,
 I DON'T REMEMBER THAT EITHER.
           - [laughs]
  - I HAVE A TERRIBLE MEMORY.
             I GOT
       A TERRIBLE MEMORY.

        - OH-HO, ARNOLD.
            - YEAH.
            - JAMES?
      - I FEEL LIKE I'M--
     I'M COPYING THIS GUY.

     BUT I'M GONNA GO WITH
  HIS DAD ALSO--HER DAD ALSO.
       - WHAT'S HIS NAME?
          - UH, RAFFE.
            - RAFFE?

         - YEAH, YEAH.
       - AND WHAT ABOUT--
       TELL US ABOUT HIM.
          - HE JUST HAS
   A SHORT TEMPER, YOU KNOW.

     YOU CAN'T TALK TO HIM.
            - YEAH.
         - I STAY AWAY.
     I STAY AWAY FROM HIM.
     - YOU STAY FROM RAFFE?
     - [laughs] YEAH, YEAH.

         - SO YOU WERE
      BACK THERE ISOLATED,
       YOU ALL RIGHT NOW?
      YOU'RE FEELING GOOD?

          wives: YEAH.

     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.
      HERE WE GO, LADIES.
          NOW THAT YOU
  AND YOUR HUSBAND ARE A DUO,

      HOW OFTEN DID HE SAY
  HE WORKS ON SOLO PROJECTS--
         WHENEVER HE'S
      ALONE IN THE STUDIO,
     ONLY WHEN YOU HAVEN'T
  PLAYED TOGETHER IN A WHILE,

      OR NEVER BECAUSE YOU
 DRAIN ALL HIS CREATIVE JUICES?
          ANTOINETTE?
       - [laughs] NEVER.

   - NEVER, BECAUSE YOU DRAIN
    ALL HIS CREATIVE JUICES?
            - YEAH.
           - [laughs]
          WHY ARE YOU
     SO SHEEPISH ABOUT IT?

       - I SUCK THE LIFE
          OUT OF HIM.
            - WHOA!
     [cheers and applause]
    I THINK EVERY MAN IN THE
AUDIENCE IS LOVING THAT ANSWER.

             - WOW.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   ARNOLD, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    HE SAID WHEN WE HAVEN'T
  PLAYED TOGETHER IN A WHILE.

             - OH.
            [laughs]
           - REALLY?
    YOU DON'T THINK--NEVER?
          - NEVER? NO?

          - HONESTLY.
        - I DON'T KNOW.
           I HOPE NOT
      WHEN YOU'RE AT WORK.
           - OH, BOY.
           - [laughs]

           - JESSICA?
             - HI.
     - I'M GONNA SAY NEVER.

      - BECAUSE YOU DRAIN
    ALL HIS CREATIVE JUICES.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
       - [laughs] I HOPE.
          - YOU HOPE.
            [laughs]

    JAMES, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - I SAID...
    - WHEN WE HAVEN'T PLAYED
      TOGETHER IN A WHILE.

             - JIM!
            [laughs]
         - WHAT? WHAT?
         - BUT YOU SAY
        YOU NEVER DO IT.

      - YEAH, WELL--WHAT?
             - JIM?
             - JIM.
     - I'LL HEAR IT LATER.
   - YEAH, I THINK YOU WILL.

           ALL RIGHT,
     ANDRA WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
     WHEN WE HAVEN'T PLAYED
  TOGETHER IN A WHILE BECAUSE
       WE'RE APART A LOT.

       WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
     SEVEN MONTHS BUT WE'VE
       ONLY BEEN TOGETHER
         FOR TWO OF IT,
       SO I CAN'T IMAGINE
    THAT IT WOULD BE NEVER.

       - ARE YOU--ARE YOU
      ALWAYS ON THE ROAD?
       ARE YOU TRAVELING?
  - OH, I TRAVEL A LOT, YEAH.
         - HE TRAVELS.
   - YOU TRAVEL A LOT, OKAY.

      THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE
 A PROFESSIONAL TENNIS PLAYER.
            - YEAH.
     [cheers and applause]

        - SO IT'S, LIKE,
        WHEN YOU PARTY,
          CAN YOU NOT
         DO A LOT OF IT
         BECAUSE IT'LL
      MESS UP YOUR WRIST?

         I MEAN DOES--
           - [laughs]
           - SHERRI.
    - JUST THE THOUGHTS THAT
 RUN RANDOMLY THROUGH MY MIND.

 OKAY, CHRIS WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        - I SAID NEVER.
            - NEVER.
             - AW.
      - BECAUSE YOU DRAIN
      THE CREATIVE JUICES.

            - YEAH.
         - HERE WE GO.
    ACCORDING YOUR HUSBAND,
  WHAT COLOR WERE THE FLOWERS
   YOU CARRIED DOWN THE AISLE
      ON YOUR WEDDING DAY?

            JESSICA?
       - PINK, HOT PINK.
          - HOT PINK?
          - HOT PINK.
       - OOH, ALL RIGHT.
     JAMES, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

        JAMES SAID THEY
       WERE WHITE ROSES.
    - OH, NO, THEY WEREN'T.
          - [laughter]
     - THEY WERE HOT PINK.

    - [laughs] WELL, YOU HAD
A WHITE THING AROUND THE DRESS.
            - DRESS.
    - OH, YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
     YOU HAD A WHITE DRESS.
     - I HAD A WHITE DRESS.

           [laughter]
   - WHITE DRESS, WHITE ROSE.
        - JIM, WHY WOULD
       I DO WHITE ROSES?
           [applause]

     - SOMETHING WAS WHITE.
 - I JUST THINK JIM'S GONNA BE
 WORKING ON THAT SOLO PROJECT.
          - [laughter]

    - DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
     ANDRA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
            - GREEN.
           ALL RIGHT,
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, CHRIS?

    - I SAID GREENY PURPLE.
   - MIX OF GREEN AND PURPLE.
           - [laughs]
   - ALL RIGHT WE'LL TAKE IT.

          YES WE WILL.
             - YAY!
     [cheers and applause]
      - OKAY, ANTOINETTE?
           - YELLOW.

      - THEY WERE YELLOW?
       OKAY, ARE YOU SURE
       THEY WERE YELLOW?
        - OH, I'M SURE.

            [laughs]
       I HOPE HE'S SURE.
           - [laughs]
    HE'S HOLDING HIS BREATH.
        ARNOLD IS REALLY
      HOLDING HIS BREATH.

            WHAT DID
        YOU SAY ARNOLD?
          - THANK GOD
         I SAY YELLOW.
           - YELLOW.
             - YAY!

           - [laughs]
     [cheers and applause]
      - ALL RIGHT, HERE'S
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

         THEY SAY THAT
     PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE,
      BUT WHOEVER CAME UP
        WITH THAT PHRASE
       CLEARLY NEVER MET
   MY WIFE'S RELATIVE, BLANK.

             ANDRA?
         - MY BROTHER.
- YOUR BROTHER, WHAT'S HIS NAME?
            - LOGAN.

    SO WHAT--CAN YOU TELL US
     A LITTLE ABOUT LOGAN?
        - UM, I THINK HE
  HAS LESS PATIENCE THAN I DO.
         - OKAY. LOGAN.

         - AND I DON'T
    THINK I'M VERY PATIENT.
          - SO, CHRIS,
        YOU SAID LOGAN?
      - I SAID HER MOTHER.
             - OH.

  - BUT IF I HAD MORE TIME TO
       THINK ABOUT THAT,
           I'D AGREE
     WITH HER ON THAT ONE.
           - [laughs]
    - I GOT YOU, ALL RIGHT.

          ANTOINETTE?
       - I WOULD HAVE TO
        SAY MY BROTHER.
        - YOUR BROTHER,
        WHAT'S HIS NAME?

           - ANGELO.
        - ANGELO, OKAY.
   - WE'RE A LITTLE ITALIAN.
 - ARNOLD, DID YOU SAY ANGELO?
   - NO, I SAID YOUR FATHER.
          - YOUR DAD.

             - OH.
         - WOULD IT BE?
   - IT COULD GO EITHER WAY.
           - JESSICA?

    - I'M GONNA SAY MY MOM.
          - YOUR MOM?
        OKAY, JAMES, WHAT
          DID YOU SAY?
       - I SAID HER DAD.
          - YOUR DAD.

       - YEAH, YOUR DAD.
     - HE'S SO EASY GOING.
 - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
    YOU TRY TALKING TO HIM.
 HE HAS, LIKE, A SHORT TEMPER.

       HE STARTS YELLING.
            - WHAT?
            - YEAH.
             YEAH.
           - [laughs]

   THESE NEXT THREE ARE WORTH
        TEN POINTS EACH.
      ARE YOU GUYS READY?
          wives: YES.
    - OKAY. IF YOUR HUSBAND
       BLAMED ONE OF YOUR

            BAD DAYS
    ON YOUR MONTHLY VISITOR,
         WOULD YOU THINK
   HE'S AN INSENSITIVE JERK,
      ANOTHER CLUELESS GUY
       OR PROBABLY RIGHT?

          ANTOINETTE?
       - PROBABLY RIGHT.
           [laughter]
 - YOU GET CRAZY ON THOSE DAYS?
            - YEAH.

         - YEAH? OKAY.
     - MORE SO THAN USUAL.
         - I HEAR YOU.
            JESSICA?
     - HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT.
       - PROBABLY RIGHT?

        - YEAH [laughs]
            - ANDRA?
           [laughter]
           - LADIES,
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

     DOROTHY SAID "THERE'S
      NO PLACE LIKE HOME,"
      BUT MY HUSBAND WOULD
         ARGUE AND SAY
        THERE'S NO PLACE
          LIKE BLANK.

            JESSICA?
  - WHAT HAPPENS IF HE PLAYS,
 LIKE, VIDEO GAMES IN HIS HOME?
   CAN I JUST SAY THERE'S NO
PLACE LIKE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES?

     - MM-HMM, ABSOLUTELY.
       - OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
       - THERE'S NO PLACE
   LIKE PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.
 - YEAH, THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE
      PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.

         - OKAY, ANDRA?
          - AUSTRALIA.
- THAT IS HIS HOME BUT IT DOES,
 HE WOULD--HE'S A HUGE AUSSIE.

            - OKAY.
     - SO THERE'S NO PLACE
        LIKE AUSTRALIA.
    - ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

          ANTOINETTE?
         - I THINK I'M
  GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH ARUBA,
  OUR FAVORITE VACATION SPOT.

            - ARUBA.
       DID SPECIAL THINGS
        HAPPEN IN ARUBA?
         - [laughs] OUR
    FIRST VACATION TOGETHER.

     IT WAS PRETTY AWESOME.
      WE'RE GOING BACK SO,
    YEAH, IT'S OUR FAVORITE.
       - OKAY, SO ARUBA.

 A MEAT STORE AND THE CUSTOMER
          BEGS TO BUY
    YOUR HUSBAND'S SAUSAGE,

      WHICH IS ON SPECIAL

       THE ENTIRE THING?

        [audience oohs]
             ANDRA?
             - 80.
             - $80.

           I LOVE HOW
        YOU TRY TO KEEP
         YOUR COMPOSURE

   - I LOVE COOKING FOR HIM.

            - OKAY.
          -'CAUSE HE'S
      VERY EASY TO PLEASE.

            - MM-HMM.

     HE CANNOT COOK AT ALL.
       HE CAN MAKE TOAST.
            - OKAY.
    - AND WHAT I DON'T LIKE
    IS PICKING UP AFTER HIM,

  SOCKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
