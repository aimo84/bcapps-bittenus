        THE THING I LOVE
 DOING FOR MY HUSBAND IS BLANK,
 BUT THE ONE THING I HATE DOING
       FOR HIM IS BLANK.

             JAMES?
     - SHE HATES, YOU KNOW,
   CLEANING UP AFTER MYSELF.
           I LIKE TO
     LEAVE CLOTHES BEHIND.

          - ALL RIGHT.
        - IT'S NOT MUCH.
       UM, LET ME THINK.
       - THERE'S NOT MUCH
   SHE LOVES TO DO FOR YOU?

         - YEAH, YEAH.
        - [laughs] WHAT?
     - THAT YOU-- YOU SAID
THERE'S NOT MUCH SHE LOVES TO...
      - YEAH, SHE DOESN'T

            ALEXIS.

           - WELL...
   I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH
        MY FRIEND LISA,
  NOT BECAUSE SHE'S, YOU KNOW,
      THAT WILD OR CRAZY,

   BUT SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST
         FUN AND BUBBLY

          - IT'S BAUM.
           AND MEGAN.

   - SHANNON'S A GREAT GIRL.
      SHE'S VERY EDUCATED.
 SHE'S STILL EDUCATING HERSELF.
         SHE'S AMAZING,

     BUT WHEN SHE GOES OUT,
          SHE PARTIES,
   AND SHE--SHE HAS TO LEAVE
      THE STATE TO PARTY,
   SHE'S A WILD--WILD GIRL...
     - SHE'S A WILD THING.

      - AND HE LOVES HER.
  HE LOVES--HE LOVES SHANNON.
 - CHRIS, DO YOU LOVE SHANNON?
       HE LOVES SHANNON.
       - I SAID SHANNON.

     THESE NEXT 3 ARE WORTH
        10 POINTS EACH.

         ARE YOU READY?
            - MAYBE.
 - MEGAN, YOU'RE LIKE, "MAYBE."
          - OH, YEAH.
   - YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE BAD.
     DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

        JUST LET IT GO.
          - LET IT GO.
 - WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR,
 WHAT'S THE FIRST BODY PART YOU
   SEE THAT MAKES YOU THINK,

      "HMM, MAYBE I SHOULD
     HAVE SOME WORK DONE"?
             DIANA.
    - UM, I'D PROBABLY MAKE
   MY WAIST A LITTLE SMALLER.

         - OKAY. MEGAN.
  - UH, NOTHING. I DON'T THINK
    I WOULD CHANGE ANYTHING.
           - NOTHING?
             - NO.

          - ALL RIGHT.
       - THERE WAS A TIME
  WHEN I WAS A LITTLE INSECURE
    AND WANTED THINGS DONE,
        BUT NOT ANYMORE.
- YOU'RE HAPPY WITH EVERYTHING.

       - I'M OKAY, YEAH.
            - GOOD.
            ALEXIS.
  - IT'S JUST A THING WITH ME.
  I WOULD HAVE TO SAY MY NOSE.
          - ALL RIGHT.

     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
     MY HUSBAND IS AS SLOW
          AS A TURTLE

    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
             MEGAN.
  - I GUESS GETTING JOBS DONE
       AROUND THE HOUSE,

CHORES AROUND THE HOUSE, MAYBE.
           - MM-HMM.
        - IT--IT DEPENDS
      ON HIS MOOD, AND...
      - SO IF YOU ASK HIM
   AND HE'S NOT IN THE MOOD--

  - YOU--SOMETIMES HE'S OKAY.
    THE OTHER DAY I GAVE HIM
     A LIST OF THREE THINGS
      AND HE GOT IT DONE,
  BUT IT'S SOMETIMES A LITTLE
 DIFFICULT TO GET HIM ON TRACK.

           - ALEXIS.
       - UH, BEN IS GOOD
       AT SO MANY THINGS,
    BUT I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
           CLEANING.

            - DIANA.
            - UM...
  MAYBE PICKING UP THE PHONE,
        HIS CELL PHONE.
           - MM-HMM.

   - LIKE, SOMETIMES I THINK
       THE TURTLE IS DEAD
        BECAUSE HE JUST
      DOESN'T PICK IT UP.
    - HE JUST LETS IT RING?
 - AND HE HAS TWO CELL PHONES.

TWO, SO WHEN HE DOESN'T PICK UP
   ONE, I CALL THE OTHER ONE,
 AND HE STILL DOESN'T PICK UP.
     - WHY DOES HE HAVE TWO
   IF HE DOESN'T PICK 'EM UP?

         - ONE FOR WORK
     AND ONE FOR PERSONAL,
        AND THEY'RE BOTH
      ALWAYS DEAD OR OFF,
 OR HE JUST DOESN'T THINK WE'RE
 EVER GONNA HAVE AN EMERGENCY.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

         - OKAY, OKAY.
             MEGAN.

      - UM, I WOULDN'T BE
       SURPRISED AT THIS,
 BUT HE'S ALWAYS ON CRAIGSLIST.
    - ALWAYS ON CRAIGSLIST?
 - YES, LOOKING FOR DIRT BIKES
           AND QUADS

     AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
  HE LIKES TO BRING HOME TOYS.
            - OKAY.
     - YEAH, FOR THE YARD.

      WHAT DID SHE SAY IS
  THE FIRST BODY PART SHE SEES

  THAT MAKES HER THINK "MAYBE
 I SHOULD HAVE SOME WORK DONE"?
             ANDRE.
       - SHE ALWAYS TALKS
    ABOUT WEARING A CORSET,

 AND I THINK SHE'D BE LIKE, A--
     LIKE, A TIGHTER WAIST.
           - UH-HUH.

          YEAH, YEAH!
        - HA HA. CHRIS.

 - UM, AND SHE'S PROBABLY GONNA
    KILL ME FOR SAYIN' THIS,
     BUT I WOULD THINK THAT
  SHE WOULD SAY HER BREASTS...
            - OKAY.
       - AND THIS BECAUSE

 I VAGUELY REMEMBER HER SAYING
THAT SHE WANTED TO GET IT DONE.
   I'M LIKE, "ABSOLUTELY NOT.
  I LOVE YOU THE WAY YOU ARE."
    - MEGAN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

      MEGAN SAID NOTHING.
          - OHH, MAN.
      - I AM VERY CONTENT
         WITH MY BODY.
         - PERFECTION.
       - THERE WAS A TIME

   WHEN I WANTED TO FIX THEM,
     BUT NOW I AM PLEASED.

    I THINK THAT IT'S HER--
      WHAT MAKES HER, HER,

  AND IT'S GONNA BE HER NOSE.
          - HER NOSE.

      - OH, THERE YOU GO.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
         NEXT QUESTION.

       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
         MY HUSBAND IS
      AS SLOW AS A TURTLE
    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.

             CHRIS.

     - OHH, I DO MY CHORES.
   - WHEN I GIVE YOU A LIST--

HOUSE I DON'T NEED TO BE DOING,

      HE HAS TO GET DONE,
     AND IT TAKES A WHILE.
    I HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF.

         - AND YOU HAVE
      TO KEEP REPEATIN'--

   SHE IS THE BETTER DANCER,

 BUT, YOU KNOW, IN THE BEDROOM,
     I'M GONNA SAY MYSELF.
            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, ALEXIS?

     SHE SAID YOU AND YOU.
            - YEAH.

     THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
  <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i> GOOD NIGHT.
       DID YOU KNOW THAT
   THE LONGEST WEDDING DRESS
      STRETCHED 515 FEET?

         THAT'S LONGER
     THAN A FOOTBALL FIELD.
   BUT WHAT FUN THE GROOM HAD
          LOOKING FOR
     THE BRIDE'S END ZONE.

 HERE ARE TONIGHT'S NEWLYWEDS.
      THEY CALL EACH OTHER
 PRINCE CHARMING AND PRINCESS.
    FUNNY, I DON'T REMEMBER
    ANYTHING ABOUT A DONKEY

       IN THE FAIRY TALE.
     MEET SHANE AND KELLEY.
         OUR NEXT GROOM
    IS OBSESSED WITH ALIENS.

      YOU KNOW WHY ALIENS
       NEVER GET MARRIED?
  THEY ALWAYS NEED SOME SPACE.
  HERE ARE BRIAN AND ARIANNA.

      AND HE WAS HER FIRST
      AND LAST BOYFRIEND,
SO SHE REALLY MEANS IT WHEN SHE
  SAYS HE'S HER ONE AND ONLY.
    WELCOME FLORIAN AND ARA.

 LET'S PLAY <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
         [upbeat music]

     [cheers and applause]
            - HELLO.
        HEY, EVERYBODY.

       HELLO, AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
          FELLAS, HI.
        - HOW YOU DOING?
         - WE HAVE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE

       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS,
         SO, GENTLEMEN,
 WE'RE GONNA GET RIGHT INTO IT.
  WHILE MANY MEN LOVE A THONG
        ON THEIR WOMAN,

  NOT ALL WOMEN ARE BIG FANS.
       SO TELL ME, GUYS,
 WHAT ARE YOUR WIFE'S FEELINGS
      ON THE DENTAL FLOSS
         OF UNDERWEAR--

        SHE LOVES THEM,
         SHE WEARS THEM
      ONLY WHEN NECESSARY,
  OR SHE'D RATHER GO COMMANDO?

             SHANE.
             - UH.
    SHE, UH, SHE DEFINITELY
          LOVES THEM,

 AND I LOVE THEM, TOO, SHERRI.
         - OKAY. BRIAN?
  - UM, I'M GONNA SAY SHE ONLY
   WEARS THEM WHEN NECESSARY.

            - YEAH?
  - IT'S NOT SOMETHING I LOVE,
  BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU GTA GO
    WITH THE FLOW, I GUESS.
       - SO YOU LIKE HER
       TO WEAR 'EM MORE?

   - I WOULD LOVE FOR HER TO
 WEAR 'EM ALL THE TIME, BUT...
        - OKAY. FLORIAN?
  - I WOULD ACTUALLY LOVE HER
  TO GO COMMANDO ALL THE TIME,

     BUT I THINK SHE ONLY--
SHE ONLY USES IT WHEN NECESSARY.
      - SHE ONLY WEARS 'EM
        WHEN NECESSARY.
            - YEAH.
    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,

         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
    I LOVE MY MOTHER-IN-LAW,
   BUT MY MOTHER HAS HER BEAT
    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
             BRIAN?

      - UM, I'M GONNA SAY,
        UH, THE COOKING.
         - THE COOKING.
  - MY MOTHER'S A GREAT COOK.
        - OKAY. FLORIAN?

- SHE JUST LIKES TO TAKE CONTROL
         OF EVERYTHING.
      IT'S EITHER HER WAY
        OR THE HIGHWAY.
     - OKAY, GOTCHA. SHANE?

    - I'M GONNA SAY NOTHING.
        SHE DOESN'T HAVE
     HER BEAT AT ANYTHING,
   'CAUSE I LOVE BOTH OF 'EM
           THE SAME.

   - YOUR MOTHER DOESN'T BEAT
YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW AT ANYTHING?
  - I'M GOING WITH THE SAFEST
        ANSWER POSSIBLE.
         - ALL RIGHT...
- MY WIFE WILL APPRECIATE THAT.

- WE FIND THAT SAFE DOESN'T WORK
ON   <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME</i>BUT OKAY.
  ALL RIGHT, THIS IS THE FINAL
      QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
   IF YOU WERE TO GIVE A TOUR
    OF ALL THE PUBLIC PLACES

       YOU AND YOUR WIFE
     HAVE GOTTEN INTIMATE,
     HOW MANY DESTINATIONS
        WOULD THERE BE?
            FLORIAN.
- TOUR--I WOULD SAY ABOUT THREE.

        - WHAT ARE THEY?
     - IT'S A LITTLE SECRET
    THAT WE HAVE, YOU KNOW--
          - A SECRET?!
    - IT HAS TO BE A SECRET.

            - WHAT?!
             - NO--
    - GIVE--CAN I HAVE ONE?
     - THE HOTEL ELEVATOR.
   - WAS THE BUILDING VACANT?
            NOBODY--

      - THERE WASN'T A LOT
      OF PEOPLE IN THERE.
 - OKAY. WHAT ABOUT YOU, SHANE?
  - I'M GONNA SAY ABOUT THREE
       DIFFERENT--THREE.

       - CAN I HAVE ONE?
   - YEAH, I HAVE NO PROBLEM
         TELLING THAT.
            - OKAY.
    - UH, BACK IN THE WOODS.

   - AS OPPOSED TO THE FRONT
         OF THE WOODS.
            - YEAH.
     - YOU WERE IN THE BACK

- WAY BACK IN THE WOODS. I DON'T
WANT TO SCARE ANYBODY, YOU KNOW,
           WITH ME...
         - OKAY. BRIAN?
 - UH, I'M GONNA PROBABLY, UH,
           SAY FOUR.

            - FOUR?
 - FOUR DIFFERENT PLACES, YEAH.
     - COULD YOU SHARE ONE?
   - SHE ACTUALLY REMINDED ME
    OF THIS PLACE RECENTLY,

     BUT IT WAS THE ACTUAL
      BACKSEAT OF MY CAR.
  - HOW COULD YOU NOT REMEMBER
   THE BACKSEAT OF YOUR CAR?
  - I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW
    HOW IT SLIPPED MY MIND,

       BUT I REALIZED IT
AFTER SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT IT.
    - OKAY, THAT IT ACTUALLY
          DID HAPPEN.
  - YEAH, THAT IT DID HAPPEN,
     I WAS THERE, YOU KNOW?

 - ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, NICE JOB.
  I HOPE YOUR WIVES CAN MATCH
         YOUR ANSWERS,
BECAUSE THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST
 POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME

      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
 SECOND HONEYMOON TO BARBADOS.
 ALMOND CASUARINA BEACH RESORT
          IN BARBADOS.
        ALMOND RESORTS,

     ALL-INCLUSIVE RESORTS
   OF BARBADOS AND ST. LUCIA,
  THAT ARE FOR YOU. ABOUT YOU.

     FOUR DAZZLING RESORTS,
   ONE INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE,
         ALL INCLUDED.

OKAY, THE WIVES HAVE JOINED US.
        WELCOME, LADIES.
         WE'RE SO GLAD
    THAT YOU HAVE JOINED US,

  BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

  EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS WORTH
    5 POINTS, SO HERE WE GO.
  WHILE MANY MEN LOVE A THONG
        ON THEIR WOMAN,
         NOT ALL WOMEN
         ARE BIG FANS.

   SO TELL ME, WHAT DID YOUR
 HUSBAND SAY ARE YOUR FEELINGS
      ON THE DENTAL FLOSS
         OF UNDERWEAR--
  YOU LOVE THEM, YOU WEAR THEM
      ONLY WHEN NECESSARY,

  OR YOU'D RATHER GO COMMANDO?
            KELLEY?
       - I HAVE NO IDEA.

    - WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL
         ABOUT THONGS?
       - I ONLY WEAR THEM
      WHEN IT'S NECESSARY.
         - OKAY, WELL,
     YOU DID HAVE AN IDEA.

            - OKAY.
   - WHAT DID YOU SAY, SHANE?
         YOU LOVE THEM.
  - YOU WEAR 'EM ALL THE TIME.

     - I MEAN, I GUESS I DO
     WEAR 'EM ALL THE TIME,
       BUT IT'S NECESSARY
         ALL THE TIME.
       THAT--THAT WAS ME.

          - I LOVE IT.
    I LOVE IT, KELLEY. OKAY.
    ARIANNA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - DEFINITELY ONLY
        WHEN NECESSARY.

     - ONLY WHEN NECESSARY.
         - HE LOVES IT,
    BUT ONLY WHEN NECESSARY.
   - BRIAN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      ONLY WHEN NECESSARY.

              ARA?
   - I'D RATHER GO COMMANDO.
  - OKAY, I HEAR YOU. FLORIAN?

    - I SAID THE SAME THING,
    BUT ONLY WHEN NECESSARY.
     - ONLY WHEN NECESSARY.
   - YOU KNOW I'D RATHER WEAR
        GRANNY PANTIES.

- YOU ONLY DO IT WHEN NECESSARY.
           - NO, I--
 - YOU WEAR IT WHEN NECESSARY.
      - WELL, HE DID SAY--
  FLORIAN DID SAY HE'D RATHER
   YOU GO THE COMMANDO, TOO.

    - WELL, I JUST REALLY--
     IT'S LIKE 24-7 WEDGIE,
           YOU KNOW?
   LIKE, WHO REALLY WANTS IT,

     - WELL, THAT'S ONE WAY
         TO LOOK AT IT.
       - WHEN NECESSARY.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    I LOVE MY MOTHER-IN-LAW,
   BUT MY MOTHER HAS HER BEAT

    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
            ARIANNA?
       - UM, I WOULD HAVE
        TO SAY COOKING.
       - WHAT'D YOU SAY?

          - OH, YEAH.
           - COOKING!
            - NICE.
             WHOO!

          - OKAY. ARA?
        - WHEN IT COMES
     TO SHOWING AFFECTION,
   BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, SHE'S--
          I LOVE HER,

    BUT, YOU KNOW, SHE'S NOT
    THAT, UM, AFFECTIONATE.
          - ALL RIGHT,
   WHAT DID YOU SAY, FLORIAN?
   SHE LIKES TO TAKE CONTROL.

      - SHE TAKES CONTROL
         OF EVERYTHING.
         - NOW, KELLEY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

       SHE IS DEFINITELY
        MORE SENSITIVE.
    - SHANE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      SHANE SAID NOTHING.

  - I WENT WITH A SAFE ANSWER.
  - SHANE, DIDN'T I TELL YOU?
        WE DON'T DO SAFE
     AT <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>

    YOU SEE HOW FAST KELLEY
  ANSWERED, AND HAD AN ANSWER?
 - YOU SEE HOW FAST SHE HIT ME?
           - UH-HUH.
       ALL RIGHT, SO THIS
     IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.

      LADIES, IF YOU WERE
         TO GIVE A TOUR
    OF ALL THE PUBLIC PLACES
      YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
     HAVE GOTTEN INTIMATE,

     HOW MANY DESTINATIONS
   DID HE SAY THERE WOULD BE?
              ARA?
     - I'D HAVE TO SAY TWO,

   BECAUSE HE DOESN'T REALLY
       WANT TO TAKE RISK.
   - OKAY, SO WHERE ARE YOU,
    YOU LITTLE NAUGHTY GIRL,
     TAKING HIM TO HAVE SEX
           IN PUBLIC?

  - UM, PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.
    - PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION?
           - UH-HUH.
           ALL RIGHT.
   FLORIAN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - I SAID THREE.
        - HE SAID THREE.
   - AND I FORGOT ABOUT THAT.
      I REMEMBER THAT NOW.
     - THAT DOESN'T COUNT.
      - THAT WAS IN A BUS.

     - WHAT WAS THE PUBLIC
        TRANSPORTATION?
        WAS IT A TRAIN?
        - IT WAS A BUS.
            - YEAH.

    - YOU FORGOT ABOUT THAT,
            FLORIAN?
YOU TOLD ME ABOUT THE ELEVATOR.
        - THE ELEVATOR.
   - YOU FORGOT ABOUT A BUS?
         - YEAH, THE--

   - THAT WASN'T ME. [gasps]
             - OH!
      - THAT WAS ALL YOU,
    RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CONDO.
  - OKAY, SO THERE'S ONLY TWO.

 THE OTHER ONE WASN'T WITH ME.
      - THAT WAS WITH YOU.
      - FLORIAN AND ARA...
      - IT WAS AN ELEVATOR
       IN OUR OLD CONDO.

           - OH, NO.
     - WE WERE COMING BACK
         FROM A PARTY.
       IT--SHE WAS DRUNK,
    SO SHE DOESN'T REMEMBER.

          I REMEMBER.
        - OKAY. KELLEY?
        SO YOU SAY ONE?
             - YES.

   - WHAT'S THE PUBLIC PLACE?
   - I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT.
   - I SWEAR, YOU AND SHANE--
         YOU CAN'T SAY?

      WHAT, WE GOT A BUS,
      WE GOT AN ELEVATOR--
        - IT WAS BEHIND
     AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
    - THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
           WITH THAT.

   WAS THE CLASS IN SESSION?
             - NO.
 - ALL RIGHT, YOU WANTED TO BE
   A COUPLE WILD LITTLE KIDS.
            - YEAH.
      - THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

           - SO ONE.
   - SO JUST THE ONE. SHANE?
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       SHANE SAID THREE.
 - OBVIOUSLY, SHE WAS TOO DRUNK
       TO REMEMBER ALSO.

         - I THINK SO.
      OKAY, SO WHERE WERE
      THE OTHER TWO PLACES
    THAT SHE CAN'T REMEMBER?

- I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER MYSELF,
             BUT...
   - SO YOU JUST SAID THREE?
      - I'M PRETTY SURE--
    I THOUGHT IT WAS THREE.

  - YOU THOUGHT IT WAS THREE?
     - I SUCK AT THIS GAME.
           [laughter]
     - ALL RIGHT. ARIANNA?

     - DEFINITELY JUST ONE.
     THE BACKSEAT OF A CAR.
    - BRIAN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        BRIAN SAID FOUR.
            - FOUR?

       - OKAY, YOU GUYS--
   I AM THOROUGHLY CONFUSED.
  - YOU KNOW, I'M NOT GONNA--

     I'M NOT GONNA GO WITH
   A MISUNDERSTOOD QUESTION.
 - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
    - I THINK THIS WAS MORE
      OF A FANTASY ANSWER.

             - OH.
- NO, IT'S NOT A FANTASY ANSWER.
         IT'S REALLY--
        - IT'S REALITY.
- MY MIND WAS OUT OF IT. I DON'T
KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING THERE.

     - ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.
BRIAN AND ARIANNA, YOU GUYS ARE
  IN THE LEAD WITH 10 POINTS.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN

      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,
  AND THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED.
          STAY TUNED.

     THESE NEXT 3 ARE WORTH
 10 POINTS EACH. ARE YOU READY?

            - SURE.
           - WHY NOT?
        - KELLEY'S LIKE,
    "I'M AS READY AS EVER."

           ALL RIGHT.
LET'S SAY YOUR BEDROOM ESCAPADES
    WERE GYMNASTIC ROUTINES.

     WHAT ONE SPECIFIC MOVE
      WOULD'VE BEEN GIVEN
       THE HIGHEST LEVEL
     OF DIFFICULTY? KELLEY?
      - LIKE, A POSITION?

        - IT'S WHATEVER
        YOU DO IN THERE.
          - BENT OVER,
  'CAUSE HE LIKES THAT, SO...

- OKAY, SO A BENT OVER ROUTINE.
            - YEAH.
     - ALL RIGHT. ARIANNA?
      - UM, I GUESS, LIKE,
         ON ALL FOURS.

    THAT'S HOW HE LIKES ME.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            AND ARA?
  - UM, PLEASURING HIS LITTLE
      CUPCAKE DOWN THERE.

            - OKAY.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
         NEXT QUESTION.

  WHAT WAS THE ONE THING YOUR
  HUSBAND NEEDED TO IMPROVE ON
  BEFORE GETTING THE PROMOTION
   FROM BOYFRIEND TO HUSBAND?
            ARIANNA?

            - UM...
   I GUESS HE NEEDED TO LEARN
   TO CLEAN UP AFTER HIMSELF
      A LITTLE BIT BETTER.
  - SO DID HE ACTUALLY DO IT?

         - UH, KIND OF.
       NOT REALLY, BUT...
I GUESS HE FAKED IT LONG ENOUGH
       WHERE I BOUGHT IT.
          - OKAY. ARA?

 - UM, HE NEEDED TO GET A JOB.
       - DID THAT HAPPEN?
       - YES, OF COURSE.
      - ALL RIGHT. KELLEY?

     - UM, WE'VE ALWAYS HAD
   AN ISSUE OF HOW HE CHEWS.
     HE CHEWS REALLY LOUD.
        - HOW'S HE SOUND
       WHEN HE'S CHEWING?

        - LIKE A HORSE.
  LIKE, HE'LL CHOMP HIS TEETH
TOGETHER, AND IT'S REALLY LOUD.
    I DON'T KNOW, I'M WEIRD
   ABOUT THAT, SO THAT'S IT.

            - OKAY.
 - BUT HE HASN'T CHANGED, SO...
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
WHEN YOUR MAN CHECKS HIMSELF OUT
    IN A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR,

     WHICH PART OF HIS BODY
  DOES HE SPEND THE MOST TIME
         ADMIRING? ARA?
        - UM, HIS ARMS.
    HE HAS REALLY NICE ARMS.

        - OKAY. KELLEY?
          - HIS CHEST.
        THIS UPPER AREA.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            ARIANNA?

    - EVERY DAY, HE ASKS ME
    IF HIS ARMS ARE BIGGER.
 THEY DON'T LOOK ANY DIFFERENT
  TO ME ONE DAY AFTER ANOTHER.
     - AND WHAT DO YOU SAY?

     - THEY LOOK THE SAME.
        - OKAY, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
         IT IS 2 PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.

          HERE WE GO.
LET'S FIND OUT HOW MUCH YOU KNOW
    ABOUT EACH OTHER'S PAST
 BY COMPLETING THIS SENTENCE--

    BLANK WAS THE FIRST NAME
    OF MY SENIOR PROM DATE,
   AND MY HUSBAND TOOK BLANK.
            KELLEY?

- I WAS HIS SENIOR PROM DATE...
            - OKAY.
    - SO WE TOOK EACH OTHER.
     - YOU TOOK EACH OTHER.
           - MM-HMM.
           - ARIANNA.

- JOEL WAS THE NAME OF MINE, AND
HE DIDN'T GO TO HIS SENIOR PROM.
          - OKAY. ARA?
 - I DON'T KNOW MY DATE'S NAME.

        I REALLY DON'T.
       LIKE, I COULDN'T--
     - YOU DON'T REMEMBER?
 - LIKE, I WAS SET UP WITH HIM,

         'CAUSE I WENT
    TO AN ALL GIRLS SCHOOL,
   SO, YOU KNOW, PEOPLE JUST
   GAVE ME--"OKAY, THIS GUY,"
     SO I WAS LIKE, "OKAY,"
     AND I DIDN'T LIKE HIM,

       SO IT WASN'T WORTH
          REMEMBERING.
         I DON'T KNOW.
       I SERIOUSLY DON'T.
       - OKAY, AND WHAT--
      - AND HIS DATE, UM,

     IT WAS HIS GIRLFRIEND
    AT THAT TIME, NAMED JA.
             - JA?
          - YEAH, JA.
- IT'S FUNNY YOU DON'T REMEMBER
  YOURS, BUT YOU REMEMBER HIS.

          - OF COURSE.
   I DID A BACKGROUND CHECK.
            - OKAY.
 ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, LADIES.

            - WHOO!
  ALL RIGHT, THE GUYS ARE BACK
    TO SEE IF THEY CAN MATCH
 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE.

     BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT,
   LET'S CHECK ON THE SCORE.
SO, BRIAN AND ARIANNA, YOU GUYS
ARE IN THE LEAD WITH 10 POINTS.
 SO, FELLAS, HERE IS THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.

         LET'S SAY YOUR
       BEDROOM ESCAPADES
    WERE GYMNASTIC ROUTINES.
     WHAT ONE SPECIFIC MOVE
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY

WOULD'VE BEEN GIVEN THE HIGHEST
      LEVEL OF DIFFICULTY?
             SHANE?
             - HMM.

             UH...
    - SHANE, DON'T YOU DARE
            GO SAFE.
    - I'M NOT GONNA GO SAFE,
         LIKE YOU SAID.

          - ALL RIGHT.
  - I'M GONNA SAY IN THE BUTT.
             - I...

  I HAVE A FEELING THAT KELLEY
      IS GOING TO KILL ME,
           BUT OKAY.
   KELLEY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     KELLEY SAID BENT OVER.
    - WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
          - OH, OKAY.

       GOT--I GOT IT NOW.
      - KELLEY, I'M SORRY.
     - OH, YOU KNOW WHAT--
  - THIS IS THE LAST TIME I'LL
GIVE SOMEBODY'S HUSBAND ADVICE.

       - IT'S ALL RIGHT.
 - I'LL TAKE YOU OUT FOR DRINKS
       AFTERWARDS, OKAY?
      - OKAY, SOUNDS GOOD.
            - OKAY.
     BRIAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - UH, THAT'S A TOUGH ONE.
  SHE'S NOT OVERLY FLEXIBLE...
        - THANKS A LOT.
           THANK YOU.
      - SO I'M GONNA SAY--
 I'M GONNA SAY ANYTHING, LIKE,

  UH, WHERE SHE HAS HER LEGS,
    LIKE, YOU KNOW, UP OVER
      MY SHOULDERS, YEAH.
        - UP OVER YOUR--
      - IN THAT DIRECTION.

   - THAT'S PRETTY FLEXIBLE.
       - WELL, YOU KNOW,
       I--IT'S AN EFFORT.
        IT'S AN EFFORT.
     - ALL RIGHT. ARIANNA?

     - I SAID ON ALL FOURS.
          - ALL FOURS.
   - I--THAT'S NOT DIFFICULT,
            IS THAT?
      - IT'S YOUR FAVORITE
        POSITIONS, GUYS.

       - YEAH. ALL RIGHT.
            FLORIAN?
         - WHEELBARROW?
   - THAT'S A DIFFICULT ONE--
         A WHEELBARROW.

   'CAUSE YOU--YOU'RE MOVING
 CONSTANTLY WITH A WHEELBARROW.
       YOU--YOU'RE TRYING
     TO CHASE IT EVERYWHERE
      WITH A WHEELBARROW.

         OKAY, THAT'S--
    WOW, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
      ARA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
 - SHE SAID WHEN SHE PLEASURES
      YOUR LITTLE CUPCAKE.

           - REALLY?
   - WELL, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
    YOU'RE HARD TO PLEASURE
           SOMETIMES.

  I HAVE TO WORK REALLY HARD.
     - ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
         NEXT QUESTION.
     WHAT WAS THE ONE THING

   YOUR WIFE SAID YOU NEEDED
         TO IMPROVE ON
  BEFORE GETTING THE PROMOTION
   FROM BOYFRIEND TO HUSBAND?

             BRIAN?
    - I'M GONNA SAY NOTHING,
      IF THAT'S AN ANSWER.
            - OKAY.
     - YOU KNOW, WE WERE--

WE WERE PROBABLY CONNECTED, AND
 SHE WAS ON THAT HUSBAND ROAD,
      UH, PRETTY QUICKLY,
            I THINK.
 - WOW, SO EVERYTHING WAS JUST
IN LINE WITH THE STARS WITH YOU.

     YOU HAD TO DO NOTHIN',
      IT WAS JUST PERFECT.
  - I--THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING,
             BUT...
          - ALL RIGHT.
    ARIANNA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

  - I SAID HE HAD TO CLEAN UP
         AFTER HIMSELF.
    - OH. WELL, YEAH, YEAH.
           - FLORIAN?

   - I WOULD SAY TO CLEAN UP
           MY CREDIT.
   - OKAY, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
              ARA?
        - GETTING A JOB.

  - YOU WERE A STUDENT, SO...
          - OH, OKAY.
          - YOU KNOW,
     YOU HAD TO GET A JOB.
         - OKAY, FINE.
     - GETTING A JOB--FINE.

       ALL RIGHT. SHANE?
  - SHE SAYS I CHEW TOO LOUD.
 I DON'T HEAR IT, THOUGH, SO...
       - HOW DO YOU CHEW?
        HOW DO YOU CHEW?

   - SHE SAYS I LIKE--I GUESS
 I, LIKE, SWISH THE FOOD AROUND
   IN MY MOUTH OR SOMETHING.
    I DON'T KNOW, YOU KNOW.
           - KELLEY?

           - CHEWING.
         - THE CHEWING!
      - THERE WE GO, BABE.
          THERE WE GO.
         - I LOVE YOU.

          WE GOT ONE.
           - GOT ONE.
         - YOU GOT ONE.
     YOU'RE ON THAT BOARD.
 OKAY, HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.

  WHEN YOU CHECK YOURSELF OUT
    IN A FULL-LENGTH MIRROR,
    WHICH PART OF YOUR BODY
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
    YOU SPEND THE MOST TIME
           ADMIRING?

            FLORIAN?
     - I WOULD SAY MY ARMS.
       - ALL RIGHT. ARA?
      - ALL RIGHT. SHANE?

     - UH, WITH MY OLD AGE,
  I'M STARTING TO GET A BELLY,
        SO I TRY TO SEE
   IF MY BELLY'S HANGING OUT
     WITH A CERTAIN SHIRT.

       - IS THAT THE PART
      YOU ADMIRE THE MOST?
    - OH, NO, THAT'S THE ONE
        I HATE THE MOST.
  NO, I'M GONNA GO WITH FACE.

       - WITH YOUR FACE?
             - YES.
      - ALL RIGHT. KELLEY,
  WHAT'D YOU SAY? YOUR CHEST.
           - OH, MAN,
   I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT ONE.

     - 'CAUSE YOU'RE ALWAYS
  UP IN THE MIRROR, YOU KNOW.
       YOU'RE A BIG MAN.
         - YEAH, I DO.
      I PUFF MY CHEST OUT
    A LITTLE BIT SOMETIMES.

   - YOU PUFF YOUR CHEST OUT.
    JUST A LITTLE BIT, HUH?
          OKAY. BRIAN?
     - I'M GONNA DEFINITELY
          SAY MY BUTT.

          - YOUR BUTT.
   - I, UH, I THINK IT'S HER
        FAVORITE THING,
        AND IT'S KIND OF
     GROWN ON ME A LITTLE.

           YOU KNOW.
     - ALL RIGHT, ARIANNA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - I SAID HIS ARMS.

   - SHE SAYS YOU ALWAYS SAY,
   "ARE THEY GETTING BIGGER?"
   - I GUESS, YEAH. I DON'T--
   THE ARMS IS A GOOD ANSWER.
             ARMS.
           - FINALLY.

          - ALL RIGHT,
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
OH, MY GOSH, ALL OF YOU ARE TIED
FOR FIRST PLACE WITH 10 POINTS.
    STICK AROUND, OUR FINAL
  BONUS QUESTION IS COMING UP,

AND IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
         DON'T GO AWAY.
  IF YOU HAVE COPD LIKE I DO,
      YOU KNOW HOW HARD
      IT CAN BE TO BREATHE

   AND WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.
   COPD INCLUDES CHRONIC
   BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA.
     SPIRIVA HELPS CONTROL
     MY COPD SYMPTOMS

     BY KEEPING MY AIRWAYS
     OPEN A FULL 24 HOURS.
        PLUS, IT REDUCES
        COPD FLARE-UPS.
      SPIRIVA IS THE ONLY
      ONCE-DAILY INHALED

   COPD MAINTENANCE TREATMENT
   THAT DOES BOTH.
     AND IT'S STEROID-FREE.
    SPIRIVA DOES NOT REPLACE
    FAST-ACTING INHALERS

      FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.
   TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF
   YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
  GLAUCOMA, TROUBLE URINATING,
  OR AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.

 THESE MAY WORSEN WITH SPIRIVA.
   DISCUSS ALL MEDICINES
   YOU TAKE, EVEN EYE DROPS.
  STOP TAKING SPIRIVA AND
  SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP

       IF YOUR BREATHING
       SUDDENLY WORSENS,
 YOUR THROAT OR TONGUE SWELLS,
     YOU GET HIVES, VISION
     CHANGES OR EYE PAIN,

   OR PROBLEMS PASSING URINE.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
  DRY MOUTH AND CONSTIPATION.
         NOTHING CAN
         REVERSE COPD.

        SPIRIVA HELPS ME
        BREATHE BETTER.
    DOES BREATHING WITH COPD
    WEIGH YOU DOWN?
      ASK YOUR DOCTOR
      IF SPIRIVA CAN HELP.

        HERSHEY'S DROPS.
A LOT OF HERSHEY'S HAPPINESS IN
LITTLE DROPS OF MILK CHOCOLATE.
      AND COOKIES N CREME.

        PURE HERSHEY'S.
   ALL RIGHT, ALL OF YOU GUYS
    ARE TIED FOR FIRST PLACE
        WITH 10 POINTS.

         NOW IT'S TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.
  IT'S WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
    ARE YOU READY, COUPLES?
            - YEAH.
    - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

   GENTLEMEN, LET'S FIND OUT
       HOW MUCH YOU KNOW
    ABOUT EACH OTHER'S PAST.
   HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETED THIS SENTENCE?

    BLANK WAS THE FIRST NAME
    OF MY SENIOR PROM DATE,
   AND MY HUSBAND TOOK BLANK.
             SHANE?

        - SHE--UH, SHE--
      THE PROM THAT SHE--
   THE ONLY PROM SHE WENT TO
   IS THE ONE I TOOK HER TO.
        SO I'M GONNA SAY
      MINE AND HER NAMES.

            - OKAY.
            - YEAH.
  - KELLEY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       SHANE AND KELLEY.
    YOU GOT 'EM BOTH RIGHT.

             - YAY!
   - THERE WE GO, BABY, YEAH!
       - I WAS SO SCARED.
             BRIAN.

   - HER PROM DATE WAS JESSE,
        AND MY PROM DATE
         WAS MICHELLE.
            - OKAY.
   ARIANNA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

            - JOEL,
AND YOU DIDN'T GO TO YOUR PROM.
        - I TOOK--I WENT
    TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROM.
    - BUT THAT DOESN'T COUNT
          AS YOUR OWN.

- I'M SORRY, BRIAN AND ARIANNA.
         I'M SO SORRY.
      ALL RIGHT, FLORIAN,
    NOW YOU HAVE TO GET BOTH
 OF THESE ANSWERS RIGHT TO TIE.

       - HER PROM, HMM...
         FOR HER PROM,
   I REMEMBER HER TELLING ME
  ONE TIME WHAT THE NAME WAS,

        I JUST--OH, MAN.
   I WOULD HAVE TO SAY MARK?
            - OKAY.

       - AND FOR MY PROM,
       HER NAME IS JA-JA.
    - ARA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
 ARA DIDN'T REMEMBER HER DATE,
   AND JA WAS YOUR PROM DATE.

     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
UNFORTUNATELY, IT WASN'T ENOUGH,
      SO CONGRATULATIONS,
       SHANE AND KELLEY,

      YOU ARE OUR WINNERS.
   YOU ARE GOING TO BARBADOS.
      AND A SPECIAL THANKS
   TO OUR RUNNER-UP COUPLES.
    DON'T WORRY, YOU'RE NOT
    GOING HOME EMPTY HANDED.

   YOU'RE GETTING A CUISINART
   SINGLE SERVE COFFEEMAKER.
     TRY THE NEW CUISINART
  SINGLE SERVE BREWING SYSTEM,
 AND MAKE A CUP OF FRESH COFFEE
     IN LESS THAN A MINUTE.

    WHETHER IT'S BOLD, TEA,
       OR HOT CHOCOLATE,
         USE THE KEURIG
      K-CUP PORTION PACKS
 TO BREW EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT,
       WHEN YOU WANT IT.

        FROM CUISINART.
     SO IT'LL BE PROM NIGHT
  ALL OVER AGAIN IN BARBADOS.
  THAT'S OUR SHOW, EVERYBODY.

      THEIR WEDDING NIGHT
     WAS A PARTY OF THREE.
         HER MOM SHARED
      THE ROOM WITH THEM.
           TALK ABOUT
     A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP.

      MEET ADAM AND NANCY.

        HELLO, HUSBANDS.
            - HELLO.
           - HI, YOU.

    WE HAVE SENT YOUR WIVES
           BACKSTAGE
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
         ARE YOU READY,
           GENTLEMEN?

            - READY.
             - YES.

      - OKAY, HERE WE GO.
           - I THINK.
- GENTLEMEN, IF YOU WERE MAKING
 A LIFE-SIZE DOLL OF YOUR WIFE,
    AND WANTED TO RE-CREATE
     THE FEEL OF HER BOOBS,

      WHAT WOULD YOU FILL
   THE DOLL'S FUN BAGS WITH?
        WALTER, PUDDING,
            OR CLAY?
             ADAM?

           - PUDDING.
           - PUDDING?
  - BECAUSE I LIKE CHOCOLATE.
             - AH.
      - AND IT JUST SEEMS
        NICE AND MILKY.

       - NICE AND MILKY.
           - [laughs]
            - OKAY.
             CHASE?
             - UH,

            I MEAN--

         YES, THEY ARE.
           ALL RIGHT.

      WHAT ABOUT YOU, ED?
    - I HAVE TO SAY PUDDING,
             SURE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.

 - JUST THE RIGHT CONSISTENCY.
IT SOUNDS LIKE, [as Bill Cosby]
     VERY GOOD CONSISTENCY
        IN THE PUDDING.
       WITH THE PUDDING,

        WITH THE BOOBS,
     AND THE PUDDING, OKAY.
     AND OUR NEXT QUESTION,
           GENTLEMEN.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

        IF A UNIVERSITY
   ASKED YOUR WIFE TO CREATE
        A NEW DEPARTMENT
        FOR THEIR SCHOOL

     SHE IS OBSESSED WITH,

     THEN SHE WOULD BECOME

   - UH, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
      GETTING READY-OLOGY,
   BECAUSE IT TAKES FOREVER.
           - DOES IT?

    - IT TAKES A LONG TIME.
          - OKAY, ED?
- I'M GONNA GO WITH SPICE-OLOGY.
         - SPICE-OLOGY?

   - BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO FULL
    CABINETS IN OUR KITCHEN,
      JUST FULL OF SPICES.
            - OKAY.
             ADAM?

        - I'M GONNA SAY
        COMPLAIN-OLOGY.
BECAUSE SHE HEARS ME COMPLAININ'
         ALL THE TIME,
     AND SHE JUST FIGURES,
         WHAT THE HELL,

 SHE MAY AS WELL COMPLAIN, TOO,
              SO--
        - OKAY, GOT YOU.
   FINAL QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
    IF YOUR WIFE WAS HOSTING

            - UM...
   - YOU GOT A LOT OF FIGURES
         IN YOUR HEAD?
       - I'M TRYIN' TO--
 YEAH, I'M--IT'S, UH, CALCULUS.

          - OH, G--OH!
             - UM--
           - OH, WOW.
       - NO, I'M KIDDING,
          I'M KIDDING.

             - OH.
      - I'M GONNA GO, 20.
             - 20.
             - YES.
- SHE'D HAVE 20 PLACE SETTINGS--

      - I'M GONNA SAY, 20.
    - NOT INCLUDING HERSELF.
            - SURE.
         - OKAY. ADAM?
  - SHE WAS HOME FOR A WHILE,
         SHE LEFT HOME,

       SHE'S A GOOD GIRL,
         I'LL SAY FOUR.
            - FOUR?
     - SO WHAT I THINK OF,
  I THINK SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL.
       - YOU THINK SHE--

- YOU THINK SHE WAS A GOOD GIRL.
    KEEP THAT IN YOUR HEAD.
          DEFINITELY.
             CHASE?
       - I'M PRETTY SURE

          IT'S FIVE...
  BECAUSE, LIKE MOST COUPLES,
           WE'VE HAD
    THAT AWFUL CONVERSATION
     THAT EVERY COUPLE HAS.

- SO YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH FIVE.
             OKAY.
           ALL RIGHT.
  FELLAS, THANK YOU. NICE JOB.
       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,

       BECAUSE THE COUPLE
      WITH THE MOST POINTS
AT THE END OF THE GAME WILL WIN
  A FANTASTIC SECOND HONEYMOON
           TO TORTOLA
 IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.

         CHECK IT OUT.
     LONG BAY BEACH RESORT
          AND VILLAS,
     AN ELITE ISLAND RESORT

           ON TORTOLA
 IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS.
      A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE
      SET THEIR OWN PACE,
         AND EVERYTHING
         IS UNSPOED,

     EXCEPT FOR THE GUESTS.
     LONG BAY BEACH RESORT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         WELCOME BACK.

NOW WHILE YOU WERE GONE, I ASKED
 YOUR HUSBANDS THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
      IS WORTH FIVE POINTS

         SO HERE WE GO,
            LADIES.
   IF YOUR HUSBAND WAS MAKING
    A LIFE-SIZE DOLL OF YOU,
   AND HE WANTED TO RE-CREATE
    THE FEEL OF YOUR BOOBS,

        WHAT DID HE SAY
 HE'D FILL YOUR FUN BAGS WITH,
            PUDDING,
             WATER,

            OR CLAY?
             NANCY?
- UM, THEY'RE VERY, UH, SQUISHY,
      LIKE WATER BALLOONS.

            - YEAH?
        - SO, UH, YEAH.
    HE'S MADE THAT, KIND OF,
     THAT REFERENCE BEFORE.
            - OKAY.
     ADAM, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

        HE SAID PUDDING.
           both: AW.
            - SORRY.
    - TARA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

            - WATER,
 BECAUSE MY HUSBAND ALWAYS SAYS
 THAT MY BOOBS ARE VERY BOUNCY,
   AND WATER BALLOONS BOUNCE.
            - OKAY.
           - [laughs]

            - CHASE?
        HE SAID PUDDING.
             - AW.
  - CATHERINE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - PUDDING WOULD BE FUN TO USE
        ON THE OUTSIDE,
        BUT I WOULD SAY
      THE INSIDE IS WATER.
  - THE INSIDE WOULD BE WATER.

    - ED, YOU LOOK CONFUSED.
     SHOW ME WHAT YOU SAID.
           - [laughs]
- I SAID PUDDING INSIDE AND OUT.
              SO--

            - OKAY.
   LADIES, OUR NEXT QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
IF A UNIVERSITY ASKED YOUR WIFE
   TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT

   FOR THEIR SCHOOL, BASED ON
SOMETHING SHE IS OBSESSED WITH.
     THEN SHE WOULD BECOME
         THE FIRST-EVER
  PROFESSOR OF "BLANK-OLOGY."

             TARA?
       - I WOULDN'T KNOW
        HOW TO WORD IT,
  BUT IT WOULD HAVE SOMETHING
  TO DO WITH HAIR AND MAKEUP.

     SO COSMOTOLOGY, MAYBE.
       - OF COSMOTOLOGY?
         - COSMOTOLOGY.
            - OKAY.
- BECAUSE I'M OBSESSED WITH IT.
   - WHAT'D YOUR HUSBAND SAY?

  HE SAID GETTING READY-OLOGY.
           - NO GOOD?
          AW, COME ON!
      THAT'S CLOSE ENOUGH.

- NO, THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU SAID,
            YOU SAID
     SHE TAKES A LONG TIME
         TO GET READY.
      - THAT IS VERY TRUE.

      - BEAUTY TAKES TIME.
      - IT DOES TAKE TIME.
 THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.
        - THAT--EXACTLY.
       - YOU'RE SAYING--

           CATHERINE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I'LL SAY VOCOLOGY.
            VOCAL--
        - VO--VOCOLOGY?
      - SINGING, KARAOKE.

   - OH, YOU LIKE DOIN' THAT.
     - THAT KIND OF STUFF.
              YES.
            - OKAY.
     ED, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     - I SAID SPICE-OLOGY.
             - OH!
 - THAT'S TRUE, I LIKE COOKING.
     - WHICH IS APPARENTLY
   WHAT SHE SHOULD HAVE SAID.

            - NANCY?
    - UM, I WILL HAVE TO SAY
        FACEBOOK-OLOGY.
            - YEAH?
       - I'M ALWAYS--YES.

  - YOU'RE ALWAYS ON FACEBOOK.
            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.
    ADAM, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    HE SAID COMPLAIN-OLOGY.

- WITH WORK, AND THIS AND THAT.
             - OH!
      - WITH--ABOUT WORK.
            - OKAY.
            - YEAH.

        - LOOK, LADIES,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
      IF YOU WERE HOSTING
         A DINNER PARTY
    FOR ALL THE MEN YOU HAVE
    SLEPT WITH IN YOUR LIFE,

        NOT INCLUDING--
    NOT INCLUDING YOURSELF,
    HOW MANY PLACE SETTINGS
DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY YOU'D NEED?

   CATHERINE, YOU ARE BURYING
    YOUR FACE IN YOUR HANDS.
         SO I AM GOING
       TO START WITH YOU.
       - [clears throat]

       OKAY, I'LL SAY 18.
 - 18? A PLACE-SETTING FOR 18,
    NOT INCLUDING YOURSELF?
          - YES. YES.
    - ALL RIGHT. OKAY, WELL,

     ED, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - I SAID 20,
  BUT I COUNTED MYSELF TWICE.
         - OH! I KNEW,
      I WAS GONNA SAY 20!

              OH!
        - I KNOW, GIRL,
           I GOT YOU,

    'CAUSE IT'S A FINE LINE
   BETWEEN 18 AND 20. I KNOW.
           - [laughs]
    - I GOT YOU. I GOT YOU.
           - EXACTLY.
            EXACTLY.

           [laughter]
      - ALL RIGHT, NANCY?
- UM, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY FOUR.

         - FOUR? OKAY.
             - YES.
    UH, LONG...YOU KNOW, UH,
      LONG RELATIONSHIPS.
       - ALL RIGHT. FOUR.

   - ADAM, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        ADAM SAID FOUR!
     - YOU'RE LUCKY, BABY,
          YOU'RE LUCKY

         YOU'RE LUCKY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
          QUITE GOOD.
     TARA, WHAT'S GOIN' ON
       BEHIND THAT SMILE?

     - FIVE. THAT IS MY...
       THAT IS MY NUMBER.
        - THAT IS YOUR--
   - IF HE SAID ANYTHING ELSE
           DIFFERENT,
      I'LL BE VERY UPSET.

         - OKAY. CHASE,
DID YOU SAY ANYTHING DIFFERENT?
         FIVE, HE SAID!
              AW!

           ALL RIGHT,
         FIVIN' IT UP!
          HERE WE GO!

             OKAY,
        ADAM AND NANCY,
       YOU GUYS ARE TIED
      WITH CHA AND TARA
         FOR THE LEAD,
  YOU'VE BOTH GOT FIVE POINTS.

     BUT WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT'S THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,
         AND THIS TIME,
    THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED,
         SO STAY TUNED.

     YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH
     NUTRITION YOU CAN SEE.
         GREAT GRAINS.
   GREAT GRAINS CEREAL STARTS
   WHOLE AND STAYS WHOLE.

         SEE THE SEAM?
  MORE PROCESSED FLAKES LOOK
  NOTHING LIKE NATURAL GRAINS.
     I'M EATING WHAT I KNOW
     IS BETTER NUTRITION.

I can't stand these spots.

     Those spots are actually
     leftover food and detergent
               residue that can
               redeposit on your
                 dishware during
                the rinse cycle.

 Gross.
             Jet-Dry Rinse Agent
            helps wash them away
          so the only thing left
          behind is the shine.

Jet-Dry rinses away residues for
       a sparkling shine.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
        IT IS YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.

   THESE NEXT THREE ARE WORTH
        TEN POINTS EACH.
        YOU READY TO GO?
           all: YES.
           - HOPE SO.

    - WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING
 HAIRSPRAY ADS COULD ALSO APPLY
       TO YOUR HUSBAND'S
      SEXUAL PERFORMANCE?
        GRAVITY-DEFYING,

    MEGA LONG-LASTING HOLD,
   OR REACTIVATES IN MINUTES.
             NANCY?

     - MEGA. LASTING. HOLD.
     - NO COMPLAINTS THERE.
    - NO, NO, NO COMPLAINTS.
  - NO COMPLAINTS. ALL RIGHT.
        - NO COMPLAINTS.

      CAN WE TAKE A BREAK,
            PLEASE?
            - TARA?
   - I WOULD ALSO HAVE TO SAY
       MEGA-LASTING HOLD.

    WE'RE ALL ABOUT QUALITY,
     RATHER THAN QUANTITY.
     - QUALITY, ALL RIGHT.
           - QUALITY.
      - MEGA-LASTING HOLD.
           CATHERINE?

        - I WOULD AGREE.
       MEGA-LASTING HOLD.
     I'M--I'M USUALLY LIKE,
         OKAY, REALLY?
      AND HE'S JUST GOIN'.

            OH, GOD,
   HIS PARENTS ARE WATCHIN'.
          - BUT YEAH,
          HE LASTS A--
      - GIRL, YOU SHOULDA
       THOUGHT ABOUT THAT

    BEFORE THE DINNER PARTY.
   - I KNOW, A LONG TIME AGO.
       - IT'S ALL RIGHT,
     THEY'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
           - [laughs]
       - YOU'RE MARRIED.

           - LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
       IF MY HUSBAND HAD
   THE POWER TO BE INVISIBLE,

   THE FIRST PLACE HE'D VISIT
       WOULD BE "BLANK."
            - TARA?
        - IN THE SHOWER,
      WHILE I'M SHOWERING.

  THAT'S ONE OF THE FEW AREAS
  THAT I NEED MY PRIVATE TIME,
     AND HE'S ALWAYS TRYIN'
  TO INVADE MY PRIVATE SPACE.
          - I GOT YOU.
           CATHERINE?

         - I WOULD SAY
  HE'D TRY TO GO IN THE BACK.
             - OH!
   I--I WOULD--I WOULDA NEVER
   THOUGHT OF LOOKIN' AT ED.

         - OH, REALLY?
       - OKAY, SO THAT'S
    WHERE ED WOULD BE, FOR--
      IF HE WAS INVISIBLE
             - YES.

           OH, YEAH.
            - OKAY.
             NANCY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - UM, I WOULD SAY
      HE WOULD TRY TO, UH,

   VISIT WHERE HIS SON LIVES,
      TO SEE HOW HE LIVES,
    AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE,
AND HOW WELL HE'S TAKEN CARE OF.
 - IS THAT A SEXUAL REFERENCE,
          OR IS THAT--

           - NO-O-O!
  - OH, HE'D VISIT--OH, OKAY.
           - HIS SON.
       - WE'RE SO USED TO
    DOIN' SEXUAL INNUENDOS--
           - NO-O-O.

       AND WHEN YOU WENT,
   VISIT WHERE HIS SON LIVES,
           I'M LIKE,
   WHERE HIS SON LIVE? OKAY.
          - [laughter]

   - WHERE DOES HIS SON LIVE?
       - IN LONG ISLAND,
  WE LIVE IN NEW JERSEY. YES.
    - IN LONG ISLAND, OKAY,
SO HE'D GO TO WHERE HIS SON IS.

         - YEAH. YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
         NEXT QUESTION.
          LADIES LOVE
     A GOOD RETURN POLICY.

     SO IF YOU COULD RETURN
ONE PART OF YOUR HUSBAND'S BODY,
    AND GET A HIGHER-QUALITY
          REPLACEMENT
    AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE,

     WHAT BODY PART OF HIS
      WOULD YOU SEND BACK?
           CATHERINE?
     - WELL, IT'S MY FAULT,
    BUT I WOULD SAY HIS GUT.

 - SO THE SPICE GIRL MAKES TOO
MUCH STUFF FOR HIM TO EAT, HUH?
           ALL RIGHT.
             NANCY?
   - MY HUSBAND IS BEAUTIFUL,
  BUT HE HAS THIS FROWN LINE,

          RIGHT HERE.
           - UH-HUH.
     HE'S ALWAYS FROWNING,
       SO I WOULD GET RID
      OF THAT FROWN LINE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
            - 100%.
            - TARA?
       - DOES HAIR COUNT
        AS A BODY PART?

      - I THINK SO, YEAH.
              YES.
 - I LOVE MY HUSBAND TO DEATH,
      BUT HE'S VERY HAIRY.
  AND IT CAN GET REALLY GROSS
         IN OUR SHOWER.

           - UH-HUH.
       - SO I WOULD SAY,
        LESS BODY HAIR.
            - OKAY.
          SO HIS HAIR.

        LADIES, HERE IS
      THE BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
           EACH PART
      IS WORTH 15 POINTS.

          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
         MY HUBBY AND I
   WILL BE TOGETHER FOREVER.
   WHICH IS EXACTLY HOW LONG
 IT WILL TAKE ME TO GET USED TO

     HIS HABIT OF "BLANK."
     AND HIM TO GET USED TO
      MY HABIT OF "BLANK."
             NANCY?
             - OOH.

  UH, BESIDES MY COMPLAINING,
      HE ALWAYS COMPLAINS
        ABOUT WORK, TOO.
    CONSTANTLY COMPLAINING.
    HE HAS HIS OWN BUSINESS,

    HE'S ALWAYS COMPLAINING,
     ALSO NOT ENOUGH WORK,
   AND I GUESS HE'LL HAVE TO
    GET USED TO MINE, ALSO.
 - YOU GUYS MUST BE SO MUCH FUN
         AT YOUR HOUSE.

   - OH, WE LOVE EACH OTHER.
       - NOT ENOUGH WORK,
TOO MUCH WORK, TOO LITTLE WORK,
           I'M TIRED.
           - [laughs]

       - ALL RIGHT, TARA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
             - OH,
   I LOVE MY HUSBAND SO MUCH,

     BUT HE NEVER PICKS UP
         AFTER HIMSELF,
        SO IT WOULD TAKE
       A LIFETIME FOR ME
       TO GET USED TO HIM
NEVER PICKING UP AFTER HIMSELF.

           - MM-HMM.
   - AND IT WOULD HAVE TO BE
MY TAKING SO LONG TO GET READY.
       - OKAY. CATHERINE?
       - I WOULD SAY HIS,

           UM, O.C.D.
   HE'S A CLEANER. BIG TIME.
           - UH-HUH.
            - BUT...
  HE WOULD HAVE TO GET USED TO
        ME BEING MESSY,

        'CAUSE IT'S JUST
       NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
     - IT'S NOT HAPPENIN',
        YOU PICKIN' UP.
      - I'M NOT CLEANIN'.
     I DON'T LIKE CLEANING,

     I HATE WASHIN' DISHES.
         I DO MY BEST,
          AND HE JUST
         GOES OVER ME.
      - YOU'RE JUST LIKE--
  - HE JUST CLEANS RIGHT AFTER

       I FINISH CLEANING.
      - YOU'RE JUST LIKE,
         I'M THE COOK,
  I'M THE SPICE GIRL, I COOK.
 - EXACTLY, I COOK, YOU CLEAN.
       GO AHEAD, PLEASE.

- YOU CLEAN, DO EVERYTHING ELSE.
           - EXACTLY.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.
