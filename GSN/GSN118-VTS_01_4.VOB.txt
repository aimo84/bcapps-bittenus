HAIRSPRAY ADS DID YOUR WIFE SAY
        COULD ALSO APPLY
  TO YOUR SEXUAL PERFORMANCE?
        GRAVITY DEFYING,

    MEGA LONG-LASTING HOLD,
  OR RE-ACTIVATES IN MINUTES?
             ADAM?

   - MEGA LONG-LASTING HOLD.
         - BECAUSE, UH,
    I HOLD OUT PRETTY LONG,
AND WE ALWAYS HAVE A LOT OF FUN,
              SO--

        - OH, ALL RIGHT.
             OKAY.
    NANCY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    MEGA LONG-LASTING HOLD.
           all: YEAH!

       - HE AIN'T LYING.
       - THANK YOU, BABY.
 - OKAY, CHASE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
             - UH,
    I GUESS I'D HAVE TO SAY

        GRAVITY-DEFYING.
       - GRAVITY-DEFYING?
   - UH, WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING
   NEW THINGS, NEW POSITIONS,
UH, YOU KNOW, A LITTLE OF THIS,
       A LITTLE OF THAT,

  SO, I'LL GO GRAVITY-DEFYING.
 - OKAY. TARA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
    MEGA LONG-LASTING HOLD.
             - AW.
            - I SAID
    MEGA LONG-LASTING HOLD,

  'CAUSE WE'RE ABOUT QUALITY,
     RATHER THAN QUANTITY.
     - ED, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 I'M GONNA GO WITH THE MIDDLE,
   AND THE MEGA LONG-LASTING.

      - MEGA LONG-LASTING?
             - YES.
    - ANY PARTICULAR REASON?
     - UH, BECAUSE WE SEEM
      TO LAST A LONG TIME.

            - OKAY.
   CATHERINE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
    MEGA LONG-LASTING HOLD!
           - WOO-HOO!
     - WE GOT SOME POINTS!

        - WE GOT POINTS!
           [laughter]
    - HOLD ON TO 'EM, GIRL.

             OKAY.
  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
  IF MY HUSBAND HAD THE POWER
        TO BE INVISIBLE,

   THE FIRST PLACE HE'D VISIT
       WOULD BE "BLANK."
            - CHASE?
             - I--
    THE VIORIA'S SECRET'S
        ANGEL SHOW? I--

           [laughter]
            - YEAH.
      IT SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

  - I--I FIGURE IT'S PROBABLY
     A GOOD PLACE TO START.
            - YEAH.
 YOU LEARN SOMETHING EVERY DAY,
           DON'T YA?

    - ALL RIGHT, WELL, TARA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         - THE SHOWER,
      WHILE I'M SHOWERING.
  - YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO WALK,
      BEFORE YOU CAN RUN.

     [laughter and cheers]
      YOU DON'T START WITH
 THE VICTORIA'S SECRET ANGELS,
     YOU FINISH WITH THEM.
             - NO.

       - NO PUN INTENDED.
        - I THINK HE HAD
       A LOT MORE IN MIND
  THAN THE VICTORIA'S SECRET'S
         ANGELS, GIRL.

         - I GUESS SO.
     - ED, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - I'M GONNA START AT A BANK.
          - AT A BANK?
     - AT A BANK, WHY NOT?

            - OKAY.
   - AND THEN I'LL BUY MY WAY
INTO THE VICTORIA'S SECRET SHOW.
          - CATHERINE?

   - I SAID IN THE BUTT, BOB.
           [laughter]
            - ADAM,

        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - SO I WOULD SAY,
   PUERTO RICO, 'CAUSE THAT'S
      USUALLY WHEN I'M OUT
          ON VACATION,
   OR AT AN ISLAND LIKE THAT.

      NOBODY CAN REACH ME,
     NOBODY CAN CONTACT ME,
AND IT'S JUST ALL BY OURSELVES,
    USUALLY, ME AND MY WIFE,
           THAT'S IT.
       - SO PUERTO RICO.

- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            YOU SAID
     WHERE YOUR SON LIVES.

          - OH, YEAH.
 - SO YOU CAN SEE HOW HE LIVES,
   'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT WITH HIM
         ALL THE TIME.
             - AW.

    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
         NEXT QUESTION.
          LADIES LOVE
     A GOOD RETURN POLICY.
  SO IF YOUR WIFE COULD RETURN
     ONE PART OF YOUR BODY,

            AND GET
  A HIGHER-QUALITY REPLACEMENT
    AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE,
    WHAT BODY PART OF YOURS
          DID SHE SAY
        SHE'D SEND BACK?

              ED?
             - HMM.
  I'M TEMPTED TO SAY NOTHING.

           [laughter]
      - I LIKE YOU, BABY,
  YOU ARE MR. PERFECT, RIGHT?
        - I DON'T KNOW.

          - CATHERINE,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - SHE SAID YOUR GUT.
             - GUT.

MY FACE, OR SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

        - THAT LITTLE--
            [laughs]
        - MY FROWN MARK,
    I THINK THEY WOULD SAY.
    - YOUR FROWN MARK. OKAY.

             NANCY,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   SHE SAID THAT FROWN LINE!
            - YEAH!
I KNEW IT, YOU'RE ALWAYS TALKIN'
           ABOUT IT,

        YOU'RE ALWAYS--
           - I SAID.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
- I GOTTA GET MY BOTOX IN THERE.
            - CHASE?
         - I'M GONNA GO

   A FEW BEERS HERE OR THERE.
            - OKAY.
     TARA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

     - BABY, IT'S THE HAIR.
         - WHAT'S WRONG
         WITH MY HAIR?
       - YOUR BODY HAIR!
             - OH!

  - IT'S ALL OVER THE SHOWER,
         IT LOOKS LIKE
    A LITTLE STUFFED ANIMAL,
           SPRINKLED
      ALL OVER THE SHOWER.

           [laughter]
   - I DON'T WANNA SEE THAT.
           - [laughs]

          - ALL RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S SEE WHERE YOU STAND.

Aren't we, Lauri?
          Absolutely.

Or aren't you?
I'm just...
      I don't know. Yes.
I'm gonna kind of stand here
and watch you do it.
Uh, your partner's
new to the game.

This is Carrie Donnelly.
And, Carrie,
when you're not with us,
what do you do?
         Well, I'm an army wife.

       And I'm a member services
       director at a tennis club
          on Monterey Peninsula.
As a, as a woman married
into the army--armed forces.

       Do you move around
  as much as everybody think?
         Yes, we've been married
                       six years
           and I've moved around
                     seven times

                  but California
          has been the best yet.
 Sink your roots in here.
      Alright, we're happy
       to have you here.

And Levar Burton, have you lived
      in a lot of places?
      I've a... I've lived
        in a lot places.
       I'm an army brat.
           And, uh...

Hey, wait a minute...
             What?
Yesterday, I've talked to woman
who's into literature
    and you right away say,

          "I'm the son
    of an English teacher."
Is there anything that
you don't relate to here?
       Well, being young,
        white and, uh...

            Female.
      [audience laughing]
       I'm none of those things.
        No, it's 'cause
     you're old and black.

      [audience laughing]
You were an army brat?
         Yeah, I was.
         I've lived in...
         I had...

      In the 12 years I've lived
      in Los Angeles,
         14 different addresses.
         It's just...
         It's something
         that's in my blood.

     I mean I move around a lot.
 I don't know how you get used
     to that sort of thing.
Uh, Kadeisha, I must
ask you the same question.

You've had a lot of children,
grandchildren,
you moved around a lot?
              Um, kind of, okay?

                  I...I moved...
  I moved from Kansas to Denver,
       from Denver to San Diego,
                  from San Diego
                 to Los Angeles.

That's...
         You know that's escape.

Things associated
with a prescription.

 Ready, go.
 Uh, not a nurse but a...
                         Doctor.
Uh-hmm.

And these are lenses.

                   Uh, contacts.
Uh-hmm.
And, uh,
this is the language
of the prescriptions

                         Latin.
Uh-hmm.
And this is where you go,

       Uh, it's a special

      It's about two women

because your opponent's

You want to match that
so we can get you
all back tomorrow and have
a fight to the death tomorrow.

      [audience laughing]
I mean,
"What is he saying here?"
Really, I hate to see
anybody not win.

So please make
my life easy.
Come back for dear old Dick,

   We've seen this other one.
       Who is this lady?
           This is my daughter.

          My next to my youngest
                daughter, Liane.
                 She's my coach.
         The 1 out of 7
         that turned up

        to cheer you on.
    Well, some live in San Diego
  and some live in Denver and...
         Well, no, no.
            Wait...

  It's totally understandable
 that they're spread all over.
    Did you really teach her
     everything she knows?
Yeah.
       She's been saying
         about that...

   That about you for years.
Oh, my God.
You made my life easy.
                        Oh, yes,
                      of course.

 You're on a hot streak here.
               Thank you, Lauri.
            You're so good Yeah.
Thank you.
      I mean that was...

     This is what the ideal
         situation is.
  We give a ton of money away
   and both players come back
        to fight it out
        again tomorrow.

       You will be here.
  Don't run away we'll be back
   to put the top on it again
     in a second right here
    on the $25,000 Pyramid.

     [audience applauding]
What did I say?
I know you'd do it.

     27 seconds left over.
 That were unused on the clock.
     [audience applauding]

 Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.
This is what's called
a horse race.
We have two contestants
who are within $1,000

or thereabouts
of one another.
One has won $13,550,
the other $11,100.
Share with me your Pyramid
experience briefly.

 You and your mom play?
          Oh, my mom,
    when I'm in Los Angeles,
      we are on the phone
   to each other twice a day

     for the two end games.
         And we play it
        over the phone.
 I give her the clues and she--
 And you guys owe us millions.

Now you know why this game
is doing well.
        [buzzer sounds]
      [audience laughing]
 No, way.

Alright, Kadeisha,
do you practice a lot?
                Yes, my daughter
                 and I practice.
       We practice-- See we have
to practice around the children.

     Okay, 'cause we have 8 kids
            living in our house.
       You know, so you practice
                 around the kids
            and the baby needs--
 And she's saying, "Got to run."

                      I'm saying
            "Change his diaper."
            Bah. You know, so...
You can play out of those
circumstances,

you can do anything.
You just roll on to this
by dumb luck, don't you?
      I just... I show up
     and the words come out

    right off of my mouth.
Alright.
Carrie, we've got to run.
We'll see you again tomorrow.
Thank you, folks.
                     Thank you.
It will be all four
the same tomorrow.

   Right here on the Pyramid.
    For now, I'm Dick Clark.
