      YOU KNOW HOW HARD
      IT CAN BE TO BREATHE
   AND WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.
   COPD INCLUDES CHRONIC

     MY COPD SYMPTOMS
     BY KEEPING MY AIRWAYS
     OPEN A FULL 24 HOURS.
        PLUS, IT REDUCES

      SPIRIVA IS THE ONLY
      ONCE-DAILY INHALED
   COPD MAINTENANCE TREATMENT
   THAT DOES BOTH.
     AND IT'S STEROID-FREE.

    SPIRIVA DOES NOT REPLACE
    FAST-ACTING INHALERS
      FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.
   TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF
   YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,

  GLAUCOMA, TROUBLE URINATING,
  OR AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.
 THESE MAY WORSEN WITH SPIRIVA.
   DISCUSS ALL MEDICINES
   YOU TAKE, EVEN EYE DROPS.

  STOP TAKING SPIRIVA AND
  SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP
       IF YOUR BREATHING
       SUDDENLY WORSENS,
 YOUR THROAT OR TONGUE SWELLS,

     YOU GET HIVES, VISION
     CHANGES OR EYE PAIN,
   OR PROBLEMS PASSING URINE.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
  DRY MOUTH AND CONSTIPATION.

         NOTHING CAN
         REVERSE COPD.
        SPIRIVA HELPS ME
        BREATHE BETTER.
    DOES BREATHING WITH COPD
    WEIGH YOU DOWN?

      ASK YOUR DOCTOR
      IF SPIRIVA CAN HELP.
