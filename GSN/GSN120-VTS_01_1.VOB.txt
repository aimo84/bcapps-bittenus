     OR A PERSONAL SHOPPER?
            TAQUANA.
     - UH, A PERSONAL CHEF.

   YOU GOTTA GET IT TOGETHER.

           - LAUREN.
    - WELL, I'D HAVE TO SAY

 COPD makes it hard to breathe,
    so I wasn't playing much
    of a role in my own life,

        but with ADVAIR,
      I'm breathing better
   so now I can take the lead
     on a science adventure.
   ADVAIR is clinically proven

      to help significantly
     improve lung function.
  Unlike most COPD medications,
      ADVAIR contains both
   an anti-inflammatory and a
   long-acting bronchodilator,

working together to help improve
   your lung function all day.
ADVAIR won't replace fast-acting
  inhalers for sudden symptoms
        and should not be
   used more than twice a day.

People with COPD taking
ADVAIR may have
  a higher chance of pneumonia.
    ADVAIR may increase your
      risk of osteoporosis

     and some eye problems.
     Tell your doctor if you
     have a heart condition
     or high blood pressure

      before taking ADVAIR.
     If you're still having
      difficulty breathing,
         take the lead.

       Ask your doctor if
        including ADVAIR
       could help improve
       your lung function.
