      LADIES, HERE WE GO.

     WE ASKED YOUR HUSBAND

   HE'S HAD SEX IN HIS LIFE.
DID HE SAY THAT NUMBER IS CLOSER

    TO THE NUMBER OF STATES
          IN THE U.S.,
    CHANNELS ON TELEVISION,
      OR STARS IN THE SKY?
             DONNA.

        HE SAID STATES.
           - STATES.
             - OHH!

- LOOK, DONNA, WE DIDN'T ASK HIM
        HOW MANY <i>PEOPLE.</i>

    - THIS NEEDS TO GO AWAY.
       - YEAH, PUT THAT--

     THAT NEEDS TO GO AWAY.
      TAKE IT AWAY, JAMES.
       ALL RIGHT, SUSAN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

           [laughter]
    - ALL RIGHT, ADAM, IS IT
       STARS IN THE SKY?
    - IT'S STARS IN THE SKY.
      - STARS IN THE SKY.

           - STARRY.
        - NOW, HEATHER,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - I KNOW SOME OF HIS NICKNAMES
      FROM BEFORE WE MET,

      SO I'M GONNA GO WITH
       STARS IN THE SKY.
      - OH, WHAT WERE SOME
       OF HIS NICKNAMES?
         - DON'T DO IT.
             - NO!

  - WE USED TO LIVE IN A TOWN
        CALLED MANAYUNK,
        AND HIS NICKNAME
  WAS "THE HUNK OF THE YUNK,"
      SO I'M GONNA GO WITH
       STARS IN THE SKY.

    - THE HUNK OF THE YUNK.
   HEY, HUNK, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
 - THERE ARE A LOT OF CHANNELS
         ON TV, THOUGH.
            - WHAT?

   - I THINK HUNK OF THE YUNK
        IS FULL OF JUNK.
       - OKAY, MOVING ON.
           - [laughs]
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
IF YOU WERE TO LOOK UP THE WORD
    BLANK IN THE DICTIONARY,
     YOU WOULD PROBABLY SEE
     A PICTURE OF MY WIFE.

             SUSAN.
            - MOODY.
       - WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        - I SAID SPICY.
            - SPICY.

- SPICY, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE YOU--
      - 'CAUSE WE'VE USED
        THAT WORD NEVER.
       - 'CAUSE YOU'RE--
           [laughter]

     YOU KNOW, YOU GET ME--
      GET MY BLOOD GOIN',
 GET ME SWEATIN' A LITTLE BIT.
         YOU'RE SPICY.
   THAT'S--IT'S A GOOD THING.

            - SPICY.
        - DO YOU AGREE?
             - NO.
             - NO?
   - NO. ALL RIGHT, HEATHER.

    - BADONK OR BADONKADONK.
           - BADONK?
          YOU GOT IT.
        DID YOU SAY IT?
      - I JUST SAID FUN...
           - FUN. OH!

      - 'CAUSE WE HAVE FUN
     WITH THE BADONKADONK.
         - WE HAVE FUN
  WITH THE BADONKADONK, SO...
       - WELL, THAT'S NOT
     THE WORD I USED. OHH.

           - I THINK
   EVERYBODY'S BADONKADONK--
        DO YOU GUYS KNOW
    WHAT BADONKADONK MEANS?
         YOU DON'T KNOW
      WHAT BADONKADONK IS?

        IT'S...[humming]
       YOU KNOW WHAT IT--
       OHH, THERE YOU GO.
      THAT'S BADONKADONK,

 BUT YOU'RE HAVIN' FUN WITH IT.
       - WITH IT, RIGHT.
         - OKAY. DONNA.
           - BOOFUL.
  - BOO--WHAT--WHAT IS BOOFUL?

 - IT'S BEAUTIFUL, BUT THAT'S--
    WE LIKE TO PRONOUNCE IT
           THAT WAY.
       - WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - I SAID BABY-LOVE.

      - HE SAID BABY-LOVE.
            - WHAT?!
      - I'LL JUST PUT THAT
          RIGHT THERE.
      - ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.

     I TRIED SOME HYPNOSIS
   ON YOUR HUSBANDS EARLIER,
    AND WHEN I SNAPPED THEM
           OUT OF IT,
    I ASKED THEM TO TELL ME
     WHICH OF YOUR FRIENDS

  HE MOST WANTS TO SEE NAKED.
   WHO DO YOU THINK HE SAID?
            HEATHER.
      - I DEFINITELY HAVE
       TO GO WITH PATTI.

            - PATTI.
      TELL ME ABOUT PATTI.
 - SHE IS, UM, MY BEST FRIEND,
 MAID OF HONOR AT THE WEDDING,

      BUT SHE IS GORGEOUS,
         SLAMMIN' BODY.
 I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH HER.
      - ALL RIGHT. STEVE,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

 - SHE HAD A BETTER DESCRIPTION
          THAN I DID.
            - OKAY.
        - I SAID PATTI.
            - DONNA.

 - I THINK HE WOULD SAY ALDEN,
   'CAUSE IT'S THE ONLY NAME
     OF MY YOUNGEST FRIEND
       THAT HE REMEMBERS.
   - ALDEN. IS ALDEN BOOFUL?

           ALDEN IS.
             - I--
            - YEAH.
        - THAT'S THE ONE
     YOU GET RIGHT. GREAT.

- ARE YOU--YOU'RE UPSET WITH HIM
   'CAUSE HE GOT THAT RIGHT?
         - I THINK SO.
           [laughter]
      - ALL RIGHT, SUSAN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY KELLY.
            - KELLY.
         - TALL BLONDE.
 ADAM'S ONLY DATED TALL BLONDES
          PRIOR TO ME.

    - SO DID YOU SAY KELLY?
        - I SAID KELLY.
          - ALL RIGHT!
           [cheering]
    WELL, YOU MIGHT BE HAPPY
    TO KNOW, ADAM AND SUSAN,

    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 10 POINTS.

    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, DONNA?
       SHE SAID NOTHING.
    - I SAID NOTHING BECAUSE
   YOU'RE ALWAYS SO ROMANTIC.

     YOU NEVER THINK ANY OF
 THE ROMANTIC STUFF IS CHEESY.

      ENCORE AFTER ENCORE.

         I'M GONNA SAY
       STANDING OVATION.
          - OH, WELL.
     [cheers and applause]
          OH, MY GOD.

 WE DON'T HAVE STANDING OVATION
          AS A CHOICE,
        BUT THAT'S NICE
       TO KNOW YOU DO IT.
     - ENCORE AFTER ENCORE.

       ALL RIGHT. SO WHAT

       IN <i>AMERICAN IDIOT?</i>
          - MAN FIVE.

     [cheers and applause]

      I'M SURE AS MAN FIVE
  YOU STAND OUT AS NUMBER ONE.
    - YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.
       - ALL RIGHT. BRAD?
  - WELL, I'M GONNA DEFINITELY
    SAY ENCORE AFTER ENCORE,

     BECAUSE IT AIN'T OVER
      UNTIL MY LADY SINGS.

    - I'M ONE OF THE MINERS.
 IT'S AT THE IMPERIAL THEATRE.
- GOT TO GO SUPPORT, DEFINITELY.
         - ABSOLUTELY.

   - OKAY, NOW WE'RE GONNA GO
         TO YOU, SEAN.
- I WOULD HAVE TO SAY ENCORE...
           - ENCORE.
  - 'CAUSE MY REAL SHOW REALLY

          - OH, YEAH.
 - YEAH. IT'S FANTASTIC, YEAH.
          - OH. WHOO!
  - AFTER 23 YEARS, THIS SHOW
IS STILL RUNNING REALLY STRONG.

       - CONGRATULATIONS.
     COMPLETE THE SENTENCE,
           GENTLEMEN.
     I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY

      THAT I WISH MY WIFE
  WERE A LITTLE LESS "BLANK."
             BRAD?
 - I WANT TO SAY I WISH MY WIFE
WERE A LITTLE LESS HARDWORKING.

        AND IF SHE WERE
   A LITTLE LESS HARDWORKING,
          WE MAY HAVE
     A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME
       FOR THOSE ENCORES
        IN THE BEDROOM.

       - OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
     SEAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
      A LITTLE LESS BUSY.
  SHE REALLY DOES WORK HERSELF
          REALLY HARD.

       IN THIS BUSINESS,
  YOU GOT TO WORK, WORK, WORK,
 AND THEN YOU GET THE NEXT JOB,
   AND YOU GOT TO COME HOME,
 TAKE CARE OF THE DOGS AND TRY
  AND TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.

           SO...BUSY.
            - BUSY.
  BEN, WE'RE GONNA GO TO YOU.
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     - I WISH MY WIFE WERE
    A LITTLE BIT LESS LATE.

            - YEAH?
      - YES. NOW HOLD ON.
     - NOW IN YOUR BUSINESS
      YOU CANNOT BE LATE.
      YOU'RE BOTH ACTORS.

     - NO, WELL, BUT SHE--
 IT'S ALWAYS WORTH IT, SHERRI.
   LIKE, SHE TAKES HER TIME,
       BUT SHE WALKS OUT
 LOOKING LIKE A MILLION BUCKS.

           - REALLY?
   - BUT SHE IS ALWAYS LATE.
    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
       I'M GONNA ASK YOU
      YOUR FINAL QUESTION.

  NO RELATIONSHIP IS PERFECT,
          SO TELL ME,
  FROM THE TIME THE TWO OF YOU
   OFFICIALLY STARTED DATING,
  WHAT WAS THE LONGEST PERIOD
  OF TIME YOU SPENT BROKEN UP?

             SEAN?
        - THREE MONTHS.
  - SOMETHING KIND OF HAPPENED
   WHERE WE JUST DIDN'T TALK
 FOR A WHILE, AND THEN, UH, I--

      THERE WAS ONE POINT
 WHERE WE BECAME FRIENDS AGAIN,
   WENT BACK--I HAD SOMETHING
WHERE I HAD TO GO IN A HOSPITAL
         FOR 24 HOURS.

  SHE WENT, GOT A HOSPITAL BED
         NEXT TO MINE,
  STAYED WITH ME ALL NIGHT...
           - SHE DID?
       - TOOK CARE OF ME,
        AND I WAS LIKE,

   "THIS IS THE ONE FOR ME,"
           YOU KNOW.
  - THAT'S HOW YOU KNOW, HUH?
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT,
      WHAT ABOUT YOU, BEN?

         - 45 MINUTES.
         - 45 MINUTES?
 WHAT WAS THE FIGHT THAT--THAT
  MADE YOU--IT WAS 45 MINUTES?
   - YOU KNOW, I DON'T EVEN--
         I DON'T EVEN--

   I COULDN'T REALLY HONESTLY
  TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS ABOUT.
      - YOU CAN'T REMEMBER
   WHAT THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT?
    - I-I HONESTLY I CAN'T.
     SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO.

        - DO I LOOK LIKE
   THE AMERICAN IDIOT TO YOU?
             - NO.
      - YOU CAN'T REMEMBER
   WHAT THAT FIGHT WAS ABOUT?

       - LISTEN. LISTEN.
        - YOU KNOW WHAT
     THAT FIGHT WAS ABOUT.
    - LISTEN, THERE'S BEEN--
       YEAH, NO, I DON'T.

    - BRAD, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- UM, YOU KNOW, WE MET IN 2004,
    AND WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
          EVER SINCE.
 WE HAVE NOT BEEN APART AT ALL.
        - OH, I LOVE IT.

THANK YOU, MY BROADWAY HUSBANDS.
           NICE JOB.
       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,
BECAUSE THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST
 POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME

  WILL WIN A FANTASTIC SECOND
      HONEYMOON TO CANCUN!
         CHECK IT OUT.

   ALL RIGHT, OUR VERY LOVELY
        WIVES ARE BACK,
          AND LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,

  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWER.
     EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS
       WORTH FIVE POINTS.
     SO HERE WE GO, LADIES.

       AT THE END OF YOUR
     BEDROOM BROADWAY SHOW,
 HOW OFTEN DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
        YOU EXPERIENCED
    YOUR OWN GRAND FINALE--

 IN A FEW SELECT PERFORMANCES,
       ALMOST EVERY SHOW,
        OR EVERY NIGHT,
  YOU GET ENCORE AFTER ENCORE?

              KAT?
      - I'M JUST GONNA SAY
      ENCORE AFTER ENCORE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     ANY PARTICULAR REASON?

          - BECAUSE...
    HE'S JUST REALLY GREAT,
        AND HE KNOWS ME,
        AND, UM, WE, UH,
  WE'RE MARRIED FOR A REASON.

             - OH!
     [cheers and applause]
           - [laughs]
        - THAT IS RIGHT.
     BEN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - ENCORE AFTER ENCORE.

     - HE SAID EVERY NIGHT.
            - WHOO!
          I LOVE YOU.
    - WHAT ABOUT YOU, HAPPY?
  - WELL, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

   IT'S DEFINITELY AN ENCORE
   AFTER ENCORE AFTER ENCORE.
     - YEAH? AFTER ENCORE.
           [laughter]
       - BRAD, ARE THERE
      MANY, MANY ENCORES?

          - OH, YEAH.
- EVERY NIGHT THERE'S AN ENCORE.
 - AND ELAINE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH
      ENCORE AFTER ENCORE.
 - OH. WHAT DID YOU SAY, SEAN?
  MM-HMM. ENCORE AFTER ENCORE.
            - YEAH!

             - YES!
         - I LOVE YOU.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
     I'M NOT AFRAID TO SAY
      THAT I WISH MY WIFE
  WERE A LITTLE LESS "BLANK."

             HAPPY?
      - UH, A LITTLE LESS,
   UM, LIKE, SELF-DEFEATING?
    - BRAD, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

   HE SAID HE WISHES YOU WERE
   A LITTLE LESS HARDWORKING.
  - OH, THAT'S SWEET, BUT NO.
      - BOTH GOOD ANSWERS.
           - [laughs]

           I LOVE IT.
    - THAT WAS A GOOD ANSWER
            AS WELL.
          - ALL RIGHT.

            - OKAY.
    ELAINE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - UM, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
     A LITTLE LESS NAGGING.
    - A LITTLE LESS NAGGING.

   - I TELL HIM TO DO THINGS,
        LIKE, YOU KNOW.
     - WHAT KIND OF STUFF?
   - YOU KNOW, LIKE EMPTY THE
DISHWASHER, TAKE THE TRASH OUT.

         - YOU'RE LIKE,
     "YOU'RE NOT ON STAGE.
GET THAT TRASH AND TAKE IT OUT."
       - I KNOW. I KNOW.
 - OKAY, SEAN, WHAT'S YOU SAY?
         - I SAID BUSY.

- HE WISHES YOU WERE LESS BUSY.
             - OH.
     - BUSY IN A WAY THERE.
  - SHE'S ALWAYS GOING AROUND.
   - YOU WERE SO SWEET, SEAN.

   SHE WAS LIKE, "NO, THIS IS
 THE REAL. TAKE THE TRASH OUT."
     - THE GLOVES ARE OFF.
      - IT'S ON. [laughs]
           [laughter]

      - IT SEEMS YOU KNOW
      YOUR WIFE VERY WELL.
           ALL RIGHT.
      KAT, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I THINK HE WISHES THAT
   I WAS A LITTLE LESS LATE,

        BECAUSE I'M LATE
        FOR EVERYTHING.
      I WAS ACTUALLY LATE
      TO THE STUDIO TODAY.
          - YOU WERE?
     BUT YOU'RE AN ACTRESS.

     YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO BE
            ON TIME.
      - I'M ALWAYS ON TIME
          TO MY SHOW.
 - KAT IS ON TIME FOR HER SHOW
        BUT NOT MY SHOW.

           [laughter]
       IT'S JUST SHERRI.
       BECAUSE I COULDN'T
         FIGURE OUT WHY

         I'M SITTING IN
       THE DRESSING ROOM,
AND I'M GOING, "I'M READY TO GO.
        I'M READY TO GO.
    WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?"
     OH, IT WAS YOU, GIRL.

  - THAT WAS ME. THAT WAS ME.
     - A LITTLE LESS LATE.
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY?
       HE WISHES YOU WERE
      A LITTLE LESS LATE.

            - SORRY.
           - [laughs]
          - I'M SORRY.
- NO, I LOVE IT. IT'S ALL RIGHT.
  I TOLD HER--I SAID YOU'RE--
     IT'S ALWAYS WORTH IT.

  NO RELATIONSHIP IS PERFECT,
          SO TELL ME,
  FROM THE TIME THE TWO OF YOU
   OFFICIALLY STARTED DATING,
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY

 WAS THE LONGEST PERIOD OF TIME
      YOU SPENT BROKEN UP?
            ELAINE?
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH
          SIX MONTHS.

    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, SEAN?
     - I SAID THREE MONTHS.
    - HE SAID THREE MONTHS.
            - YEAH.
             - OOH.

   - I'M NOT GOOD WITH TIME,
            I GUESS.
       - YEAH. BUT YOU'RE
       BACK TOGETHER NOW.
     - WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.
    THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

           - FOR NOW.
            - OKAY.
           [laughter]
         YOU BETTER GET
 ALL THESE ANSWERS RIGHT, SEAN.

           ALL RIGHT.
    - TILL THE SHOW'S OVER.
     - KAT, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I'M GONNA SAY I REALLY
 DON'T THINK THAT WE'VE EVER--

       WE'VE BEEN LIKE--
   I MEAN, I MAY HAVE THROWN
        MY RING AT HIM.
     - YOU MAY HAVE THROWN
       YOUR RING AT HIM?

  DOESN'T THAT QUALIFY AS A--
     - SHERRI, IT ACTUALLY
    WAS ON THE SKYPE SCREEN
     WHEN WE WERE SKYPING,
      AND THE SKYPE WORKS.

  - YOU WERE SKYPING, AND YOU
THREW THE RING AT THE COMPUTER?
          - OH, YEAH.
        WE WERE ENGAGED,
        AND I WAS LIKE,
   "OH, YEAH? YOU SEE THIS?"

         AND I THREW IT
         AT THE SCREEN,
           AND THEN I
       SHUT THE COMPUTER.
           - [laughs]
 - SO THAT WAS, LIKE, AN HOUR.

AND THEN I CALLED HIM, AND I WAS
    LIKE, "I'M SORRY, BABY."
        SO, OFFICIALLY,
      MY ANSWER IS I THINK
     WE HAVE BEEN TOGETHER
     FROM THE BEGINNING...

      - AND HAVE NEVER...
        - AND HAVE NOT.
    - BEN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - THAT SCREEN WAS SHUT
        FOR 45 MINUTES.

      - HE DOESN'T REMEM--
      YEAH, HE REMEMBERS.
         - I WAS CLOSE.
        YEAH, I DID SAY.
  DIDN'T I SAY, LIKE, AN HOUR
    LATER I CALLED HIM BACK?

     - YEAH, BUT YOU SAID,
         "OFFICIALLY."
     - LISTEN, IN MY HEART,
     WE WERE NOT BROKEN UP.
          OKAY? OKAY?

     WHAT WE WERE YOU DOING
      IN THOSE 45 MINUTES?
     [cheers and applause]
         - OKAY, HAPPY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - UH, WE'VE BEEN
      STRAIGHT ON THROUGH
   SINCE THE VERY BEGINNING,
      'CAUSE HE WOULD SAY
     THAT HE HAD ME HOOKED
    FROM THE VERY BEGINNING,

 BUT I WILL SAY THAT I HAD HIM
HOOKED FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
- YEAH, FROM THE VERY BEGINNING?
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     - I SAID WE WERE IN IT
           TO WIN IT.

            - NEVER.
            - YEAH.
       - IN IT TO WIN IT.
    I AM LOVING MY COUPLES.
   LET'S SEE WHERE YOU STAND.

     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
    LADIES, IT IS YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.

   THESE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
  ARE YOU READY TO GO, LADIES?
             - YES.
      - OKAY, HERE WE GO.

       WHEN YOU FIRST MET
         YOUR HUSBAND,
  WHAT WAS THE FILTHIEST THING
          ABOUT HIM--
      HIS MOUTH, HIS MIND,
       OR HIS APARTMENT?

              KAT?
   - I'M GONNA SAY HIS MIND,
     'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?
   EVEN IF THAT'S NOT RIGHT,

HE'S GONNA THINK I'M THE COOLEST
   WIFE EVER FOR SAYING THAT.
        HOW ABOUT THAT?
   - HIS MIND. THAT'S RIGHT.
     HAPPY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - HIS MIND IS DEFINITELY,
       UM, YEAH...FILTHY.
   - ELAINE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
   WITH THE APARTMENT, UM...

        - HIS APARTMENT.
 - BECAUSE SEAN LIKES TO LEAVE
 A LITTLE TRAIL EVERY MORNING.
 LIKE, YOU CAN SEE THE CLOTHES
   AND THE PROGRESSION, YEAH.

      - SO HIS APARTMENT.
        - HIS APARTMENT.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
  HERE'S OUR SECOND QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

   UNLESS YOU WANT TO HEAR A
      THREE-HOUR MONOLOGUE
WITH NO INTERMISSION, DO NOT GET
 MY HUSBAND STARTED ON "BLANK."
             HAPPY?
          - FOOTBALL.

        - OKAY. ELAINE?
 - I'M GONNA GO WITH POLITICS.
            - YEAH.
      - UM, IT'S NOT MY--
LIKE, I DON'T REALLY CARE, SO...

    - DO YOU ZONE OUT OR...
     - I TOTALLY ZONE OUT.
  I HAVE IDEA WHAT'S GOING ON,
 AND I LIKE IT THAT WAY, SO...
           - [laughs]
         - I'M HONEST.

   - OKAY, HONEY. ALL RIGHT.
              KAT?
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH
 COLLEGE FOOTBALL SPECIFICALLY.
          - ALL RIGHT.

  - BEN HAS BEEN KNOWN TO CRY
   WHEN HIS TEAM DOESN'T WIN.
       HE IS A TCU FAN...
      - COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
      - AND IT'S ALL ABOUT
     THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
   HERE'S OUR NEXT QUESTION.
     WHERE'S THE ONE PLACE
       YOU WANT TO DO IT,
   BUT YOU KNOW YOUR HUSBAND
     WOULD NEVER GO FOR IT?

            ELAINE?
             - OOH.
   THERE ARE SO MANY PLACES.
           [laughter]
       UM, I'M GONNA SAY
   HIS DRESSING ROOM AT WORK.

     - HAVE YOU EVER TRIED
      IN A DRESSING ROOM?
     - I HAVE TO BE HONEST
          AND SAY NO,
      BUT ONE DAY I WILL,
        HOW ABOUT THAT?

     [cheers and applause]
   - I WOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING
          ABOUT THAT,
  BUT THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT.

              KAT?
  - I WOULD SAY OUTSIDE, JUST
   GONNA SAY THAT, RIGHT NOW.
     I MEAN, LOOK WHAT I DO
         FOR A LIVING.

           - I KNOW.
          - I LIKE IT
     WHEN PEOPLE WATCH ME.
           [laughter]
    - SO OUTSIDE, I GOT YOU.

             HAPPY?
 - I WOULD DEFINITELY--I WOULD
    HAVE TO SAY AT WORK TOO,
      'CAUSE WHEN WE WERE
         ON <i>FULL MONTY,</i>

     WE ACTUALLY EVEN HAD--
THERE WAS EVEN BEDS IN THE SET.
             - YES.
   - AND WE WERE VERY CAREFUL
       NEVER TO EVEN SIT

      ON THE BED TOGETHER,
          SO I WOULD--
          I WOULD SAY
      ALSO AT THE THEATER.
    - AT THE THEATER, OKAY.
            - YEAH.

         - NOW, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.

  ALL RIGHT, THE GUYS ARE BACK
    TO SEE IF THEY CAN MATCH
 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE.
  SO HERE WE GO WITH THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.

           GENTLEMEN,
    WHEN SHE FIRST MET YOU,
   WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY WAS
THE FILTHIEST THING ABOUT YOU--
     YOUR MIND, YOUR MOUTH,
       OR YOUR APARTMENT?

              BEN?
     - I WOULD SAY MY MIND
 BECAUSE, UH, WHEN SHE MET ME,
    THEY--THEY--IN THE CAST
   THEY CALLED ME YOUNG BEN.

            - YEAH.
      - I WAS A DIRTY BOY.
             - OH!
     [cheers and applause]
       I SEE KAT GRINNING
      LIKE A CHESHIRE CAT.

    - WHAT? I AM AN ACTRESS.
           - [laughs]
     - I KEEP IT TOGETHER.
        - OH, ALL RIGHT.
      - BUT IT'S HIS MIND.
        - IT'S HIS MIND.

            - YEAH!
           - [laughs]
 YOUNG BEN--A LOT ON HIS MIND.
       - ALL RIGHT, BRAD,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - WELL, WE HAD--THERE'S
    A VERY SPECIFIC STORY...
            - OKAY.
  - WHICH BACKS UP MY ANSWER.
          UM, ON TOUR,
    WE WERE IN THIS HOT TUB

 WITH A COUPLE OF OTHER PEOPLE
          IN THE CAST.
           - UH-HUH.
   - AND THEY WERE ALL LIKE,
"SO YOU KNOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK
         ABOUT HAPPY?"

   - RIGHT, SO THEY KNEW HER.
      - THEY HAD KNOWN HER
PRETTY WELL, I WAS THE NEW GUY.
 SO LIKE, "SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
         ABOUT HAPPY?"

    AND ME, I WAS SO STUPID.
        I WAS JUST LIKE,
       "GIVE ME A WEEK."
   I SAID, "GIVE ME A WEEK,"
   NOT THINKING, NOT KNOWING

     THAT IT--IT WAS GONNA
        GET BACK TO HER.
        - BACK TO HAPPY.
       - LIKE, IN AN HOUR
   IT GOT RIGHT BACK TO HER.

   - HOW WAS SHE ABOUT THAT,
      THE "GIVE ME A WEEK,
   AND I'LL MAKE HER HAPPY"?
     - SHE WAS--WELL, UM...
         - HOW WAS SHE?

     - I MEAN, SURE ENOUGH,
       SIX DAYS LATER...
        SO I'M GONNA SAY
        IT WAS MY MOUTH.
      - IT WAS YOUR MOUTH.
    - MY DIRTY MOUTH, YEAH.

      - ALL RIGHT, HAPPY,
       WAS IT HIS MOUTH?
      SHE SAID YOUR MIND.
             - MM.
  - YOU ONLY OPENED THAT MOUTH
   THAT ONE TIME ABOUT THAT.

      - OH, YOU KNOW, I--
 - THE MIND IS ALWAYS WORKING.
 - I THOUGHT--MY FIRST INSTINCT
   WAS MIND, BUT I WAS LIKE,
   "IT CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH."
  - IT CAME OUT OF YOUR MOUTH.

     SEAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - I WOULD SAY MESSY APARTMENT.
         THE APARTMENT.
   - MESSY APARTMENT. ELAINE?

      IT'S THE APARTMENT.
        - HE DON'T LIE.
     [cheers and applause]
         - I LOVE YOU.

  - WHOO, EVERYBODY'S SO GOOD.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
    IT'S OUR NEXT QUESTION.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

    UNLESS YOU WANT TO HEAR
     A THREE-HOUR MONOLOGUE
     WITH NO INTERMISSION,
     DO NOT GET MY HUSBAND
      STARTED ON "BLANK."

             BRAD?
    - I COULD GET SPECIFIC,
   BUT I THINK IT'S GONNA BE,
      LIKE, LIKE FOOTBALL.
    - HAPPY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
           FOOTBALL.

        - YES, FOOTBALL!
         - WHOO! WHOO!
     - OKAY, SEAN, AND YOU?

      - UM, WELL, I MEAN,
     I COULD SAY POLITICS,
 BUT I--IT'S LIKE HALF-AND-HALF
          OR WHATEVER.
     UM, I WOULD HAVE TO GO
       WITH COMIC BOOKS.

     - WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE
          COMIC BOOK?
         - <i>SPIDER-MAN,</i>
     <i>THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN.</i>
         - <i>SPIDER-MAN.</i>

  ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID YOU SAY,
            ELAINE?
   - WE'RE GETTING A DIVORCE.
          - POLITICS.
           - OH, NO!
 - THAT WAS SO CLOSE, SO CLOSE.

  - OKAY, BEN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - I'M A DIE-HARD
  TCU COLLEGE FOOTBALL FAN...
            - YEAH.

       - SO I'M GONNA SAY
       COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
    - KAT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - I SAID COLLEGE FOOTBALL.
     [cheers and applause]

         I KNOW MY MAN.
           HE CRIES.
   - YEAH, SHE SAYS--SHE SAYS
    THERE'S ACTUALLY TEARS.
 - WELL, IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.
           - [laughs]

      ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,
     WHERE'S THE ONE PLACE
      SHE WANTS TO DO IT,

         BUT SHE KNOWS
     YOU'D NEVER GO FOR IT?
             SEAN?
      - UH, I DON'T KNOW.
          IN THE CAR?

             - CAR.
           ALL RIGHT.
     MISS ELAINE--SHE SAID
      YOUR DRESSING ROOM.
           all: OOH!
      - JUST SO YOU KNOW.

  - OKAY, LET'S GO ON TO BEN.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  - I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY
PLACE THAT I WOULD TURN IT DOWN.
     - KAT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       - WAH-WAH-WAH-WAH.
      - KAT SAID OUTSIDE.
       - OH! THAT'S TRUE.
        - LIKE OUTSIDE.
        - I WOULD DO IT.
   I WOULD ABSOLUTELY DO IT.

     [cheers and applause]
         - YEAH. YEAH.
         THAT'D BE HOT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     BRAD, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - I'M GONNA SAY, UM,
       IT'S OUR BACKYARD.
        - THE BACKYARD?
  - BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN HINTING
    THAT SHE WANTS TO SPEND
      MORE TIME OUT THERE.

 - I THINK YOUR NEIGHBORS WOULD
  LOVE TO BE PART OF THAT ONE.
       ALL RIGHT, HAPPY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           - NO, NO.
   - SHE SAID AT THE THEATER.

  - NO, THAT'S NOT WHY I WANT
 TO SPEND TIME IN THE BACKYARD.
     - I THINK SHE ACTUALLY
   WANTS YOU IN THE BACKYARD
      TO DO THE BACKYARD.
           - [laughs]

        - THAT'S RIGHT.
      - OKAY, BEN AND KAT,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 30 POINTS.

    STICK AROUND. OUR FINAL
  BONUS QUESTION IS COMING UP,
AND IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS,
      SO ANYBODY CAN WIN.
         DON'T GO AWAY.

     [cheers and applause]
             EUREKA!
   GUYS, I'VE FIGURED IT OUT!
   "THE LAW OF PIZZAPLICITY!"

                  GO ON...?
 YOU CAN GET TWO DIGIORNO PIZZAS
 FOR THE PRICE OF ONE DELIVERY.

              I THINK YOU JUST
               DOUBLED MY IQ.
         YOU'RE WELCOME.
 DOES THAT MAKE YOU
LIKE A PIZZAMATICIAN?

         [ gasps ]
                        DOES IT?
        <i>[ Male Announcer ]</i>
    <i>IT'S SIMPLE PIZZAPLICITY.</i>
 <i>YOU CAN GET TWO DIGIORNO PIZZAS</i>

          <i>FOR THE PRICE</i>
        <i>OF ONE DELIVERY --</i>
    <i>CAUSE MORE OF A GOOD THING</i>
     <i>IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING.</i>
        <i>IT'S NOT DELIVERY,</i>
          <i>IT'S DIGIORNO.</i>

                 CAN I CALL YOU
                PROFESSOR PIZZA?
YES YOU CAN.
NESTLE. GOOD FOOD. GOOD LIFE.

  Captioning provided by GSN.
             HELLO.

              HI!
       HELLO AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
      FELLAS, HOW ARE YOU?

           - AWESOME.

     - SHERRY! I LOVE YOU.
   - THANK YOU! I LOVE THIS.
          - BEAUTIFUL.
          - I LOVE IT.

     I'M FEELING THE ENERGY
     COMING FROM YOU GUYS.
    I AM SO READY TO START,
        AND WE HAVE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE

     SO THAT WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS,
SO WE WILL GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT,
       ALL RIGHT, FELLAS?
            - GOOD.
      - LET'S GET INTO IT.

           ALL RIGHT.
 GENTLEMEN, COMPLETE YOUR SIDE
   OF THIS PHONE CONVERSATION
        WITH YOUR WIFE.
             HELLO.
WHY, YES, IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY,

     I'LL GO OUT OF MY WAY
     TO PICK UP SOME BLANK
      BEFORE I COME HOME.
             LUKE.

   - SOME SORT OF FOOD ITEM,
BECAUSE WE DON'T KEEP GROCERIES
    IN OUR HOUSE VERY MUCH.
   - ANY POSSIBLE FOOD ITEM?
        - MAYBE CHEESE.

           - CHEESE?
            - YEAH.
    - ARE YOU A CHEESE MAN?
  - YOU NEVER CAN HAVE ENOUGH
     CHEESE IN YOUR HOUSE.

          - OKAY. TIM.
      - WELL, I CAN RELATE
     TO THE CHEESE COMMENT.
I MEAN, I THINK MOST OF US CAN,

     BUT I THINK WHAT SANDY
     WOULD DEFINITELY WANT
        IS POTATO CHIPS.
      - ALL RIGHT. JASON.
- IF I HAD TO SAY, ME, I'M GONNA
  SAY WHAT EVERY WOMAN WANTS,

    AND THAT'S SOME FLOWERS
      AND SOME CHOCOLATE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  - THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA SAY.

    - WE HAVE TO TAKE ONE--
   - I'LL GO WITH CHOCOLATE.
  - WITH CHOCOLATE. ALL RIGHT.
          - SO THIS IS
  OUR NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.

 WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLAINING,
   DOES YOUR WIFE DISH IT OUT
        BY THE TEASPOON,
        THE TABLESPOON,

          OR THE TON?
              TIM.
       - THE TABLESPOON.
       - THE TABLESPOON?

      - 'CAUSE I'VE SEEN--
      I'VE SEEN THE TONS,
     AND SHE'S BY NO MEANS
          A TEASPOON,
       SO I'M GONNA STICK
        WITH TABLESPOON.

     - WITH THE TABLESPOON.
     JASON, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - YOU WANT TO SWITCH WIVES?
          - OHH, MAN.
    WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY?

   - WELL, MY WIFE, SHE TENDS
     TO HOLD EVERYTHING IN,
     SO, UH, WHEN I GET IT,
      I GET IT BY THE TON.
         - OKAY. LUKE.

    - MY WIFE'S A COMEDIAN,
AND THEREFORE, WE SEE THE WORLD
         IN COMPLAINTS,
 AND SO FROM MORNING TO NIGHT,

   IT'S PROBABLY COMPLAINING
        BACK AND FORTH,
SO SHE'S DEFINITELY GOT HER TON.
- I LOVE THAT YOU SEE THE WORLD
         IN COMPLAINTS.

            - YEAH.
      - GENTLEMEN, THIS IS
      YOUR FINAL QUESTION.
  IF YOUR WIFE WROTE A COLUMN
            IN   <i>COSMO</i>

   FEATURING HER TOP TEN TIPS
   ON HOW TO PLEASE YOUR MAN,
         WHAT WOULD BE
      HER NUMBER ONE TIP?
             JASON.

        - BRAVO JULIET,
      WHICH, UH, IF YOU...
 BREAK IT DOWN MILITARY STYLE,

       YOU TAKE THE FIRST
      TWO LETTERS OF EACH,
   THAT WOULD BE WHAT IT IS.
             - OHH.

        10-4, WE GOT IT.
            - WHAT?
           - GOT IT.

  OKAY, LUKE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - UH, IN ORDER TO PLEASE
            HER MAN,
       MY WIFE WOULD SAY,

          HAVE SEX...
        OR MAKE WHOOPEE,
 AS THEY WOULD SAY IN THE '70s,
         UH, ON A VERY,

      VERY FREQUENT BASIS.
             - TIM.
     - I-I THINK I WOULD GO
   THE EXACT SAME DIRECTION.

   HER NUMBER ONE SUGGESTION
       WOULD BE QUANTITY.
      - WOULD BE QUANTITY.
             - YES.
      - ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
  THANK YOU SO MUCH. NICE JOB.

       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,
BECAUSE THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST
 POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME
      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
  SECOND HONEYMOON TO CANCúN.

         CHECK IT OUT.
     THE CASAMAGNA MARRIOTT
         CANCUN RESORT
    IS LOCATED IN THE HEART
     OF CANCúN'S HOTEL ZONE

     ON A BEAUTIFUL STRETCH
   OF THE MEXICAN CARIBBEAN.
     SURROUNDED BY PRISTINE
         WHITE BEACHES,
  THE AAA FOUR-DIAMOND RESORT

     OFFERS SPACIOUS ROOMS
     WITH PRIVATE BALCONIES
  AND WORLD-CLASS RESTAURANTS.
OKAY, THE WIVES HAVE JOINED US.

        WELCOME, LADIES.
      YOU GOT A BIG SMILE
         ON YOUR FACES.
       WERE YOU WONDERING
  WHAT IS GOIN' ON OUT THERE?

THEY WERE RUNNIN' THEIR MOUTHS.
   LET'S SEE WHAT THEY SAID.
SO WHILE YOU WERE GONE, I ASKED
 YOUR HUSBANDS THREE QUESTIONS
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
       IS WORTH 5 POINTS.
      LADIES, HERE WE GO.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
       COMPLETE HIS SIDE

   OF THIS PHONE CONVERSATION
           WITH YOU?
             HELLO.
WHY, YES, IF IT MAKES YOU HAPPY,
     I'LL GO OUT OF MY WAY
     TO PICK UP SOME BLANK

      BEFORE I COME HOME.
             ABBI.
      - I WOULD SAY MILK.

         - MILK. OKAY.
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, LUKE?
       LUKE SAID CHEESE.
         - OOH, CLOSE.
           - WELL...
        - EH, YOU KNOW.

         - IT'S DAIRY.
         - IT'S DAIRY!
       - GOOD JOB, BABY.
        GROC--GROCERIES.
          - I LOVE IT.

         - PLEASE. OHH.
    - I KNOW YOU WERE WITHIN
       THE DAIRY REALM...
            - YEAH.
      - AND THEN--I KNOW.

      - HE ALMOST GETS ME.
            - SANDY.
- I THINK HE WOULD SAY POPCORN,
          BECAUSE IT'S
     MY VERY FAVORITE THING

    AND I EAT IT FOR, LIKE,
       DINNER SOMETIMES,
    AND IF I DON'T HAVE IT,
      I'M A GRUMPY-PANTS.
         - SO POPCORN.
           - POPCORN.

          - ALL RIGHT.
      TIM, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   - I SAID... POTATO CHIPS.
        - POTATO CHIPS.
  - I'M IN THE SNACKING REALM,

             BUT...
           - POPCORN.
     I EAT IT ALL THE TIME.
         - THAT'S TRUE.
         - WHAT ABOUT--
  - YOU--YOU SHOULD KNOW THIS.

           - [snorts]
             - WOW.
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANOTHER HUSBAND
     SCOLD ANOTHER HUSBAND.

   WELL, JASON, WHILE YOU'RE

         ON THE FLOOR,

         THE BATHROOM,
      AND JUST EVERYTHING.
  THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO
  COMPLAIN ABOUT IN MY HOUSE.
            - OKAY.
          - NOT TRUE.

            - JASON.

  - ABBI, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
    - DEFINITELY BY THE TON.
         - BY THE TON.

  FEATURING YOUR TOP TEN TIPS
   ON HOW TO PLEASE YOUR MAN,
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY

    THAT DIDN'T SOUND RIGHT.
          - THANK YOU.
      - DOES THAT PLEASE--
       THAT PLEASES LUKE?
     - THAT'S MY SPECIALTY.
          - OH, OKAY.

        10 POINTS EACH.
     ARE YOU READY, LADIES?
             - YES.
         - HERE WE GO.

       LADIES, WOULD YOU
       DESCRIBE THE AREA
     BENEATH YOUR HUSBAND'S
           MIGHTY OAK
     AS A LUSH UNDERBRUSH,

      A WELL-TRIMMED LAWN,
           OR A FIELD
   CLEARED OF ALL SHRUBBERY?
             ABBI.

         - THIS MAN HAS
      A LUSH UNDERBRUSH...

  - THAT HAS NOT BEEN TOUCHED
    SINCE THE DAWN OF TIME.

- ALL RIGHT. WE GOT THREE LADIES

     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
MY HUSBAND IS IN DESPERATE NEED
       OF AN INTERVENTION

 WHEN IT COMES TO HIS OBSESSION
          WITH BLANK.
             SANDY.
       - THIS MIGHT SOUND
    KIND OF WEIRD, BUT MEAT.

   - HIS OBSESSION WITH MEAT.
 - YEAH, HE REALLY LIKES EATING
   MEAT OF, REALLY, ANY KIND.
            - OKAY.

      - SO I WOULD PREFER
        AN INTERVENTION,
    GET SOME POPCORN IN HIM.
    - I KNOW, 'CAUSE THAT'LL
  BALANCE IT OUT GREAT, RIGHT?

       - NEED THE FIBER.
           - DONATA.
     - I WOULD SAY HIS NEED
       FOR BRAVO JULIETS.

    - HE'S GOT AN OBSESSION
      WITH BRAVO JULIETS.
     - YES, SICK OBSESSION.
            - OKAY.
             ABBI.

     - OBSESSED WITH SHOES.
       - WITH THE SHOES.
    - HE LOVES GETTING SHOES
   THAT ARE DIFFERENT COLORS
     AND DIFFERENT STYLES.
 - YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH SHOES.

   ALL RIGHT, LADIES, THIS IS
       OUR NEXT QUESTION.
   WHEN YOU FIRST CHECKED OUT
         YOUR HUSBAND,
  WHAT DID YOU CONSIDER TO BE
   HIS UNIQUE SELLING POINT?

            DONATA.
          - HIS SMILE.
             - YES?
 - YEAH. IT WAS REALLY BRIGHT,

      AND IT JUST SOLD ME.
            - GREAT.
             - YES.
            - ABBI.
   - HIS WARM, GENTLE NATURE,

  SO HOPEFULLY--HIS BIG HEART.
         - OKAY. SANDY.
       - HIS COUCH. UM...

            - WHAT?
      - WE MET IN COLLEGE
         IN THE DORMS,
    AND DORM ROOMS ARE JUST
   BUNK BEDS AND HARD CHAIRS,

     AND HE HAD A COUCH...
             - AHH.
    - SO THAT'S WHAT GOT ME.
  - THAT WAS A HOT COMMODITY.
          - BIG TIME.

        - WELL, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
        IT HAS 2 PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
     ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 5,

 HOW MANY STARS DID YOUR FAMILY
       GIVE YOUR HUSBAND
    WHEN THEY FIRST MET HIM,
AND HOW MANY STARS DO YOU THINK
      HIS FAMILY GAVE YOU?

             ABBI.
          - MY FAMILY
     OF MOTHER AND SISTER--
THEY'RE LIKE THE JUDGE AND JURY.

     THEY GAVE HIM 1 STAR.
           - 1 STAR?
- IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM.
THEY HAVE VERY HIGH STANDARDS...
         - SO ANYBODY.
   - AND ANYONE--THEY DIDN'T

   WANT ME TO MARRY ANYBODY.
            - OKAY.
          - HIS FAMILY
    WAS MUCH MORE WELCOMING
   AND THEY GAVE ME 5 STARS.
    - THEY GAVE YOU 5 STARS.

          OKAY. SANDY.
      - I THINK MY FAMILY
       GAVE HIM 4 STARS.
           - MM-HMM.
    - THEY LIKED HIM A LOT.

       MY GRANDMOM THINKS
   HE LOOKS LIKE MARIO LOPEZ.
             UM...
      AND THEN HIS FAMILY
     DEFINITELY GAVE ME 5.

        - OKAY. DONATA.
  - I WOULD SAY THAT MY FAMILY
         GAVE HIM A 3,
      BECAUSE MY FAMILY'S
       VERY CONSERVATIVE

      AND MUCH MORE LIKE,
         MAYBE, QUIET,
     AND HE'S VERY LOUD...
            - YEAH?
 - AND THEN I THINK HIS FAMILY
          GAVE ME A 5.

    - AND THEY GAVE YOU A 5.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

   - OKAY, THE GUYS ARE BACK
    TO SEE IF THEY CAN MATCH
 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE,
      SO HERE'S THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.

DID YOUR WIFE DESCRIBE THE AREA
    BENEATH YOUR MIGHTY OAK
     AS A LUSH UNDERBRUSH,

      A WELL-TRIMMED LAWN,
       OR A FIELD CLEARED
       OF ALL SHRUBBERY?
             LUKE.

     - A WELL-TRIMMED LAWN,
         WAS THAT THE--
       - YES, THAT'S ONE
        OF THE OPTIONS.
     - A WELL-TRIMMED LAWN.
   IT'S NOT OUT OF CONTROL...

           - MM-HMM.
       - LIKE, YOU KNOW--
 - I LOVE HOW YOU SAY "IT'S NOT
    OUT OF CONTROL, BUT..."
 - YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT. I DIDN'T
  GO WILD IN EITHER DIRECTION.

            - OKAY.
  - I DIDN'T, LIKE, YOU KNOW.

    SOMETHING THAT YOU WANT
     THE NEIGHBORS TO SEE.
          I MEAN, I...
           - I--OKAY.

   I DON'T KNOW IF ABBI WOULD
    SO MUCH AGREE WITH THAT,
           BUT OKAY.
    ABBI, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   ABBI SAID LUSH UNDERBRUSH.
       - LUSH UNDERBRUSH.

            - WHAT?
   - IT'S A MESS DOWN THERE.
      - YOU NEED TO SEE IT
         MORE RECENTLY.
     - TIM, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - A WELL-TRIMMED LAWN.

     - A WELL-TRIMMED LAWN?
- FOR ALL YOUR NEIGHBORS TO SEE?
     - WELL, HOPEFULLY NOT.
         HOPEFULLY NOT.
   I THINK OUR NEIGHBORHOOD--

   IT'S GOT SOME OLDER FOLKS,
      AND NO--NOBODY WANTS
          TO SEE THAT.
      SO I-I'M GONNA SAY,
    WELL, WE KEEP IT INSIDE.

   - SANDY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      A WELL-TRIMMED LAWN.
             JASON.

- ON THE AVERAGE, I'M GONNA HAVE
TO SAY IT'S A WELL-TRIMMED LAWN.
- WHEN IT'S NOT ON THE AVERAGE,
   WHAT--WHAT IS IT USUALLY?
       - A BARREN DESERT.
        - OH, ALL RIGHT.

   WHAT DID YOU SAY, DONATA?
        SHE SAID A FIELD
     CLEARED OF SHRUBBERY.
    JASON, NO BRAVO JULIETS.

             THAT--
      - ALL RIGHT, JASON,
