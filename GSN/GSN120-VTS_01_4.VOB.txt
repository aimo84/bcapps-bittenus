AND I GOT SHAWNE.

WE'RE GOING FOR THE CASH, MAN.
WE'RE GOING FOR THE CASH.
       Yeah, he won the batting
        title way back i in '35.

  Actually it wasn't 1935, he
        won it in '38...
     with a .386 average.
You sure?

           I'm 99.9% positive.
So you don't know.
  <i>Made with 100% Angus beef, to</i>
      <i>make guys 100% happy.</i>

   <i>Ball Park Angus Beef Franks.</i>
      I'm 99.99999% sure.
If you don't know, you
don't know...it's fine.

         EAT GOOD FATS.
           AVOID BAD.
     DON'T GO OVER 2000...

      1200 CALORIES A DAY.
 CARBS ARE BAD. CARBS ARE GOOD.
   THE STORY KEEPS CHANGING.

    SO I'M NOT LISTENING...
     TO ANYONE BUT MYSELF.
    I KNOW BETTER NUTRITION
    WHEN I SEE IT:

         GREAT GRAINS.
   GREAT GRAINS CEREAL STARTS
   WHOLE AND STAYS WHOLE.
         SEE THE SEAM?

  MORE PROCESSED FLAKES LOOK
  NOTHING LIKE NATURAL GRAINS.
     YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH
     NUTRITION YOU CAN SEE.
         GREAT GRAINS.

     SEARCH GREAT GRAINS
     AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.
 FOR MULTI GRAIN FLAKES THAT ARE
 AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF FIBER
       TRY GREAT GRAINS
       BANANA NUT CRUNCH

  AND CRANBERRY ALMOND CRUNCH.
 LOOK WHO WE GOT HERE.
  PUT A LITTLE PEPPER ON THAT.

       I'M A TYPICAL MOM.
    I GO TO AMUSEMENT PARKS.
      AND MY KID'S GAMES.

 AND JUST LIKE ANY TYPICAL MOM
 I'M THRILLED WHEN MY CHAMPION
     LOVES TO EAT SOMETHING
     NUTRITIOUS,

 LIKE CHOBANI CHAMPIONS YOGURT.
 IT'S A GOOD SOURCE OF PROTEIN,
AND MOST IMPORTANT, HE LOVES IT.

     SO EVEN THOUGH I'M AN
     OLYMPIAN, AROUND HERE,
 I'M JUST ANOTHER MOM TRYING TO
 HELP HER CHAMPION WIN THE DAY.
       CHOBANI CHAMPIONS.
       WIN THE DAY.

JORDANS--57.
STILL ANYBODY'S GAME.
For months, I had this deep pain
        all over my body.

    It just wouldn't go away.
     My doctor diagnosed it
        as fibromyalgia,
        thought to be the
   result of overactive nerves

       that cause chronic
        widespread pain.
       Lyrica is believed
      to calm these nerves.
  I learned Lyrica can provide
       significant relief

     from fibromyalgia pain.
      And for some people,
   it can work in as early as
  the first week of treatment.

    So now I can plan my days
      and accomplish more.
   Lyrica is not for everyone.
    Lyrica may cause serious
       allergic reactions

or suicidal thoughts or actions.
   Tell your doctor right away
       if you have these,
  new or worsening depression,

   or unusual changes in mood
          or behavior,
       or any swelling or
   affected breathing or skin,
     or changes in eyesight,
     including blurry vision

    or muscle pain with fever
        or tired feeling.
       Common side effects
   are dizziness, sleepiness,
  weight gain, and swelling of
      hands, legs and feet.

       Don't drink alcohol
      while taking Lyrica.
  Don't drive or use machinery
         until you know
     how Lyrica affects you.

         With less pain,
       I'm feeling better
   now that I've found Lyrica.
         Ask your doctor
       if Lyrica is right

   for your fibromyalgia pain.
