         BEFORE COPD...
      I TOOK MY SON FISHING
           EVERY YEAR.

      WE HAD A GREAT SPOT,
 NOT EASY TO FIND, BUT WORTH IT.
          BUT WITH COPD
   MAKING IT HARD TO BREATHE,
            I THOUGHT
    THOSE DAYS MIGHT BE OVER.

          SO MY DOCTOR
      PRESCRIBED SYMBICORT.
 IT HELPS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE
        MY LUNG FUNCTION
  STARTING WITHIN FIVE MINUTES.

    SYMBICORT DOESN'T REPLACE
        A RESCUE INHALER
      FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.
         WITH SYMBICORT,
   TODAY I'M BREATHING BETTER.

    AND THAT MEANS...FISH ON!
      SYMBICORT IS FOR COPD
  INCLUDING CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
         AND EMPHYSEMA.

     IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN
     MORE THAN TWICE A DAY.
SYMBICORT MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
       OF LUNG INFECTIONS,
          OSTEOPOROSIS,
     AND SOME EYE PROBLEMS.

        TELL YOUR DOCTOR
  IF YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION
     OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
        BEFORE TAKING IT.
      WITH COPD, I THOUGHT
 I'D MISS OUR FAMILY TRADITION.

   NOW SYMBICORT SIGNIFICANTLY
   IMPROVES MY LUNG FUNCTION,
   STARTING WITHIN 5 MINUTES.
   AND THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
        IN MY BREATHING.

       TODAY, WE'RE READY
   FOR WHATEVER SWIMS OUR WAY.
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT SYMBICORT.
  I GOT MY FIRST
PRESCRIPTION FREE.

           Thank you
        very, very much.
   Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.

            Welcome
    to The $25,000 Pyramid.
   Good house full of people.
  We've got some fine players.

        Lois, are you up
         to the battle?
      You would better be.
          Yes, we are.
You said hello
to your new partner?
              Yes.

                          Yeah.
This is Caroline Norton.
                         Right.
I want to say Morton.
It's Norton with an N.
                   Yes. Uh-huh.

What do you do, Caroline?
             Uh, I'm a teacher.
                   I have second
              and third graders.
And what is the age
of a second and third grader?

                  Well, 7, 8, 9,
                   sometimes 10.
Uh-hmm.
And this is the way
you spend your time off?

                      Yes, yes.
This is gonna be
a great relief.
                 Uh-huh, uh-huh.
            This is much harder.
But then again
you haven't met Bill Cullen.

              Ah!
Man has a mind
of an eight year old.
         That's right.
      [audience laughing]
    I'm in the fourth grade.

You got through
from the third already?
             Yeah.
How are you, Bill?
           I'm fine.
           I'm playing
           with the richest guy

          I have known in years.
Well, he's done
mighty well here.
This is Paul Teague
who is a cartoonist by trade.

A stand-up comedian,
too, I gather?
                          Yeah.
    How much money have you won?
    This isn't funny, this guy--
           No, this is not funny
           'cause I won $29,000.

Yeah.
    $25,000 of it yesterday
         in 45 seconds
         right in that
  Winner's Circle over there.

   That's where you do that.
 Uh, you all know that, I don't
 have to talk much about that.
     Let's get to the game.

     We have Super Savers,
      A Bird In The Hand,
       The Pan Handlers,
          Park Place,
           Heave Ho.
     I'll Believe Anything.

 We play a 7-11 as a bonus card
      in the first round.
  And, Lois, please, if you'll
      select it, we'll go.
       Okay, you got one?
                      Heave Ho.

           Heave Ho.

     [audience applauding]

Super Savers,
A Bird In The Hand,
The Pan Handlers,
Park Place,
I'll Believe Anything,
Bill?

           Something my partner
          will never have to do,
        not with all this money,
              The Pan Handlers.
         You know it.

        These are things
     associated with gold.
Things associated
with gold.
 Ready, go.

 Uh, a king wears it.
                      Oh, crown.
A soldier gets this
for bravery.

                          Medal.
Uh, it's a dime
or a nickel or a...
                         A coin.

 Uh, 16 make a pound.
                  Oh, an ounce.
Uh-huh.
The king,

And finally gold comes in--
Things--
                        Bricks.
                       Bullion.
That's it.
There you go.
         You did great.

7-5.
     [audience applauding]
       Oh, that was great clues.
We got a good one
working this time.

Caroline, you must do
a little catching up, though.
It's up to you right now.
What would you like?
            Oh, uh,
     I'll Believe Anything.

                     That's it.
I'll Believe Anything.
Alright.
Caroline, describe these things
people believe in.
                       Alright.
Things people believe in.

 Ready, go.
         The United States of...
 America.

            Uh, a wedding is a--
 Celebration.
      Two people joined together
                         is a...

Union.
              A wedding is a...
Go on.
                   Let's go on.
             Uh, oh, in Africa--

Ceremony.
                            No.
                     In Africa--
Voodoo.
                       Yes. Oh.

               A guidance person
                 in high school,
        who guides you to choose
             your classes is a--
                    Guidance...
Oh, uh, go ahead.

Counselor.
                         Right.
             Uh, if you have
             a certain skill,
             you have a great...
Talent.
                          Good.

    Uh, to be reborn again is--
        [buzzer sounds]
(Dick)
Hmm.
    What was the other one?
    Uh, the wedding thing?
Marriage.

           Marriage.
 It was marriage, ladies.
      Marriage, marriage.
                          Yeah.

              Oh!
Give me a flicker
of recognition.
Tell me-
Tell me you know you've heard
of that institution, Lois.

 9-7.
   Ladies, this is not good.
 I don't want to be the bearer
        of bad tidings,

but that score is brutal.
   That's not a great score?
             Hmm.
No.
                   Is it so bad?

    The rosy silver linings
    part of this, Caroline,
  is that you worked real hard
         at this round,
        fashion yourself
   into a good frame of mind,

          you'll play
      for the next round,
  because I think the guys are
 gonna have some fun with this.
You're so far ahead now.

Now, I've got them all
up there.
Hyped up they're gonna go
right now.
Paul, what would
you like?

          Uh, Bird In The Hand.
You got it.
     Describe these birds.
        These are birds.
 Ready, go.

             Okay, this is, uh--
    You eat it with fries and...
Chicken.
                          Yeah.
            And this is the bird
            that talks.

Parrot.
                        Uh-hmm.
      And this is something-
      something throws something
      at you, you go--
Duck.
                         Right.

 And, uh, this is
 the beautiful white bird that--
Swan.
                           Yes.
           And, uh, blank hood.
Robin.

That's good.
                    And a sea...
Sea swallow.
Sea terns

           The kind that you see
                        at the--
Sea gull.
                         Right.
     And, uh, blank under glass.

Uh, pheasant.
That's got it.
        Perfect clues.
     [audience applauding]

14-9.
The men have a rather
substantial lead.
Caroline, you got a 50-50 chance
at the 7-11 card.

    Now, very carefully now
    because here's a chance
        to pull this up.
You probably won't
win the game,

but you could win $1,100.
Where is that card?
                    Park Place.
          You got it.

     [audience applauding]

You want to give?
    You can give or receive
       whatever you like.

             I guess I'll give.
Alright.

Tires.
                        Uh-huh.
       Uh, a black widow is a...
Spider.
                         Right.

                Uh, another word
             for a yacht is a...

                with this.
Shovel.
                        Uh-huh.

    Oh, that's just a pile of...
Trash. Garbage.
Rubbish.
                In a blank yard.
                    A pile of...

Oh, junk.
                         Right.
You got it!
                            Oh!
      [audience cheering]

 Congratulations.
     $1,100 in bonus money.
     Thank you, thank you,
           thank you.

I felt so bad that you're not
gonna win this round.
         I shouldn't be
        predicting this,
but people who watch
this show regularly,

knows 16-14 at this stage
is not a winning hand.
 You've won $1,100.
Now, Paul and Bill, you can
probably take this easily

and run over and try
for $10,000.
Who will give?
                     I will let
               Mr. Cullen give.
             Alright, Billy,
             you take the screen

        and describe these words
        used by a travel agent.
              Words used
              by a travel agent.
You need 17, gentlemen.

 Ready, go.
Uh, when you take
a holiday, you're on...
                        A trip.
You take a...

                      Vacation.
Right.
Uh, the person
who shows you things.
Points things out is a...
               Oh, a tour guide.

      Uh, y-you get not a room
      in a hotel, several rooms.
                        A suite.
That's the 17 points

they need to go
to the Winner's Circle
right after this.
         Today's workout

Wow.

Let's make it $39,000
while we're on this role, huh?
     Yeah, let's do that.
             Okay.
Okay.

Okay, for anybody
who might not know
or has never watched
The Pyramid,
it's Bill's requirement
to give a list only,

not to use his hands.
He doesn't have the right
to skip over anything
that gives him difficulty,
and return to it later.

There's 60 seconds
that will elapse.
Good luck, gentlemen.
Get the pictures in your mind
of what he's talking about.

 And for $10,000,
here is your first subject.

There isn't any better

                    Clown and--
What do you get a picture of
when you see a clown?
    Uh, people with makeup.
You got it.

           Oh, boy.
                That's so funny
              how that happens.
Yeah.
   It didn't come to your mind.
                    That's all.
            Uh, the last thing--
            There is no such--

          There is such a thing,
          but I don't know
          what they call it.
 A crinkly straw.
You know what
I'm talking about?
      Oh, things that bend.

Yeah. Then he gives you
a head nod.
   Then we give you a head nod,
              then we say hose.
A radiator hose.
          Uh, tubing.
A liberal thinker.

          Ah! Oh, uh--
Flexible.
              Oh.
Things that are flexible.

Contortionist.
That's good.
                   Contortionist
            is a very good clue.
             I don't like to use
               religion, though.

 Will you stop?
$300 in the till.
We'll be back to play

 Lois, your partner
 has just won $300.
He will be your partner
in the next round.

And we should mention
your film coming up this fall.
     Yes, "Outlaw" on CBS.
And, uh, needless to say
none of us know exactly

when it will be on,
will it be some time this
during the fall season.
      Late fall, I think.
   I think October, November.
When do you shoot it?
          Uh, this--
      During this summer.

And this is based--
    I leave about two weeks.
You told us it was based
on a true story.
          It is, yeah.
      It is a true story.

            And, uh,
     and very fascinating.
A drama?
            A drama
    and it's still on going
    because the story is--
What do you mean
it is not resolved?

Uh, there is just something
that is not finished about it
and I don't want
to give it away.
Oh.
          But, uh...

             Hmm.
             It is a true case.
                          Yeah.
Whether somebody
is guilty or not guilty,

   Alright, we'll look for it.
       Outlaws this fall.
     You're gonna give away
    the punch line. Alright.

Corner Of The Market.
Alright.

There, you still haven't

Things that can have corners.

 Ready, go.
    Okay, this is, you put this

                  you turn the--
Pages.
                         Right.
        And this is not a circle
        but a...

Square.
         And, uh, on a farm,
         you have a lot of land.
         Many...
Acres.
                         Right.

        And this is--
        When you get in trouble,
                  you have to go
                  to this place
                and have a judge
                and a jury.

     [audience applauding]
There's too much
that came out.
                          Yeah.
 14-13.

The good part about that, Paul,
is you have a 50-50 chance
of winning the trip or trying
to win a chance to Rio.
One of those over there
has the card behind it.

         Something Is Not Right.
       Oh! You picked it.
     [audience applauding]

You want to give
or receive?
