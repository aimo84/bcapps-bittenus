["FAMILY FEUD" THEME PLAYS]
Steve: THE WOOTTON FAMILY, 275.
AND, McGINNIS FAMILY, YOU'RE

PLAYING WELL. IT'S STILL
ANYBODY'S GAME. WE'LL BE RIGHT
BACK TO FIND OUT WHO WINS THIS

THING RIGHT AFTER THIS.
      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,

  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.

     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.

IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,

      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.

   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.

      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,

    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.

    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,

    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.

  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.

 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.

            AT 40 MPH,

      HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE
        TO GO 190 MILES?"

    NOW, THROUGH THE COURSE OF
  THE GAME, YOU HAVE TWO CHEATS.

   YOU HAVE A PEEK AND A COPY.
   WITH THE PEEK, YOU CAN LOOK
    AT YOUR CLASSMATE'S PAPER,
     DECIDE IF YOU WANT TO GO
    WITH THEIR ANSWER OR NOT.

WITH THE COPY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE
THE ANSWER THEY'VE WRITTEN DOWN.
   AND YOU HAVE ONE SAVE, WHICH
 MEANS IF YOU ANSWER INCORRECTLY

IF IT'S GOING 40 MILES AN HOUR,
     IN 4 HOURS,
IT'S GOING TO GO 160 MILES.
THAT LEAVES 30 MILES LEFT,

 WHICH IS 30 OVER 40,
    WHICH IS 3/4.

"ALLIANCE," WERE YOU?
            [ SIGHS ]

              NOPE.
        I WAS NOT THINKING
           "ALLIANCE."
          I WAS THINKING
     THAT IT WAS "AEROSPACE."

           DID THAT POP
         INTO YOUR MIND?
      [ GROANS ]
       I TAKE THAT AS A NO.

           [ LAUGHTER ]
       WELL...
IF IT WAS "AEROSPACE,"

   THE "S" WOULD BE
KIND OF USELESS THERE, HUH?
OH, I'M JUST GONNA HOPE
   THAT IT'S RIGHT.
           I'LL TELL YOU THIS --

               JACOB IS WRONG.
      [ SIGHS ]
     THAT'S GOOD.

           [ LAUGHTER ]
 NOT THAT I WISH YOU
TO NOT BE RIGHT, BUT...
 MORE IMPORTANTLY, BECAUSE JACOB
   COULDN'T DO YOU ANY GOOD --

     THIS GUY HAS THE CHANCE
   OF SAVING YOU -- HE'S WRONG.
         OOH.
  I THOUGHT IT WAS "AEROSPACE,"
          AND <i>I</i> WAS WRONG.

        [ AUDIENCE OOHS ]
     [ CHUCKLES ]
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME SWEAT,
     AREN'T YOU?

       NO, I'M JUST ITCHING
      TO SEE YOU BREAK-DANCE
     'CAUSE YOU GOT $300,000!
        YEAH!

  OUR CONTESTANT, STEVE NALEPA,
        HAS GOT $300,000.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

       WE HAVE ONE SUBJECT
        LEFT ON THE BOARD.
 NOW, YOU JUST BUSTED A MOVE FOR
  US WITH A LITTLE BREAK-DANCE.
    ARE YOU GONNA DO THE WORM
 IF WE GET UP TO HALF A MILLION?

       WHY NOT?
             WHY NOT?
          YOU STILL HAVE
         YOUR COPY LEFT.

           YOU STILL HAVE
          YOUR SAVE LEFT.
    WE'RE IN THIN AIR UP HERE.
      WE DON'T GET THIS HIGH
           VERY OFTEN.

       OH, MAN.
       YOU READY TO SEE THE
 HALF A MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION?
  LET'S BRING IT ON!
     LET'S DO IT!

   THE $500,000 QUESTION IS...
    "WHAT REVOLUTIONARY LEADER
 "WROTE THE INFLUENTIAL PAMPHLET
          'COMMON SENSE'

            IN 1776?"
      SPENCER HAS LOCKED IN.
       OH, BOY.

OH, BOY.
  LET ME REMIND YOU,
YOU'VE GOT A COPY LEFT.

 HE ANSWERED QUICKLY.
YOU'VE GOT A SAVE LEFT,
MEANING IF YOU ANSWER WRONG BUT
SPENCER HAS THE RIGHT ANSWER,

   HE CAN SAVE YOU.
YOU CAN GO HOME RIGHT NOW.
         YOU CAN DROP OUT
 OF THIS LITTLE 5th GRADE CLASS.

    I KNOW YOU GRADUATED YALE.
           [ LAUGHTER ]
         YOU CAN DROP OUT
     OF THIS 5th GRADE CLASS

     WITH $300,000 RIGHT NOW.
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
      MIGHT BE A LITTLE BIT
           EMBARRASSING

       FOR YOUR ALMA MATER.
           $300,000 IS
      A PRETTY GOOD PAYDAY.
    THAT IS TRUE.

       OH, BOY.
       WELL...
      WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

     DO YOU KNOW
REVOLUTIONARY WAR HISTORY?
       WELL, SIMILAR TO...
            SIMILAR TO
  THE INAUGURATION-DAY QUESTION,

  SOMETHING POPPED INTO MY HEAD
           RIGHT AWAY.
WHAT POPPED INTO YOUR HEAD?
           THOMAS PAINE
       POPPED INTO MY HEAD.

       I'M GLAD
YOU DIDN'T SAY JANUARY 20th.
           [ LAUGHTER ]
           THAT'S TRUE.

            BUT, UH...
             OH, BOY.
YOU'VE GOT A COPY LEFT.

 YOU GOT A SAVE LEFT.
OR YOU CAN TAKE $300,000
THAT IS IN YOUR POCKET
      RIGHT NOW.

            [ SIGHS ]
         Shh.
   WHEN YOU GOT UP
    THIS MORNING,

DID YOU THINK YOU'D BE MAKING
THESE KIND OF DECISIONS TODAY...
             OH, MAN.
               I...

    ...NOT KNOWING
THAT A FEW HOURS LATER,
 YOU WERE GONNA HAVE
ALMOST 1/3 OF A MILLION DOLLARS
IN YOUR BANK ACCOUNT?

            [ SIGHS ]
YOU'VE ANSWERED 9 OF THE 10
QUESTIONS ON THE BOARD.
        OH, BOY.

            YOU ANSWER
           THIS RIGHT,
          WE ARE LOOKING
 AT THE MILLION DOLLAR QUESTION.
    WE HAVE NOT HAD ANYONE WIN
   $1 MILLION ON THIS SHOW YET.

    I WANT TO GIVE IT AWAY TO
  SOMEBODY THAT CAN BREAK-DANCE.
         OH!
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

       WELL...
              BUT...
             BUT...

THE THING THAT MAKES ME
FEEL THE WORST ON THIS SHOW
  IS TO SEE SOMEBODY
 DROP DOWN TO $25,000
    FROM THIS HIGH
    UP THE LADDER.

            [ SIGHS ]
        THAT IS DEFINITELY
           A BIG DROP.
  THAT'S A BIG DROP.

     RIGHT NOW --
        BUT IT'S MORE THAN
         I STARTED WITH,
  AND, YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T BE
 ANY FUN IF I JUST DROP OUT NOW,

            WOULD IT?
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
        ALL RIGHT, JEFF,
I'M GONNA BE PRETTY DARING HERE,

AND I'M GONNA TRUST THAT SPENCER
   WILL COME IN AND SAVE ME.
 I'M GONNA GO WITH THOMAS PAINE.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

       OH, BOY.
            THESE GUYS
    ARE ALL IN THE 5th GRADE.
   LET'S TAKE A LITTLE STROLL.

       WHAT DID ALANA SAY?
      DID THAT OCCUR TO YOU
        AS A POSSIBILITY?
  HE WAS TOO BUSY
  BEING A GENERAL.

    TOO BUSY TO RUN TO KINKO'S
     AND MAKE SOME PAMPHLETS?
           [ LAUGHTER ]
      YOU KNOW,
HE DID CHOP DOWN A CHERRY TREE.

  HE HAD A LOT OF COMMON SENSE.
     SHE'S IN THE 5th GRADE.
    LET'S SEE WHAT MARKI SAID.
       [ AUDIENCE GROANS ]

     SHE'S IN THE 5th GRADE.
    LET'S SEE WHAT JACOB SAID.
          JACOB SAID...

    THEY ALL LIKE
  GEORGE WASHINGTON.
    LET'S SEE WHAT KYLE SAID.
     KYLE'S IN THE 5th GRADE.

       [ AUDIENCE GROANS ]
HE WAS AROUND IN 1776.
             I THINK
      HE WAS AROUND IN 1776.

     STEVE...HOW YOU FEELING?
         OH,
I'M PRETTY NERVOUS, JEFF.
      BUT I'M --

         YOU WANT TO SEE
        WHAT SPENCER SAID?
OH, I WOULD LOVE TO SEE
  WHAT SPENCER SAID.
    WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID,
  IF YOU HAD TO GUESS RIGHT NOW?

 WELL, EVERYONE ELSE
IS GOING WITH GEORGE WASHINGTON.
        EVERYBODY BUT YOU.
  EVERYBODY BUT ME.
      IT'S TRUE.

  WELL, HE'S EITHER
GOING WITH THOMAS PAINE
OR GEORGE WASHINGTON.
