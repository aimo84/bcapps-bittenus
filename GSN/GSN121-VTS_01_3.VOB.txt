          DON'T MISS IT.
      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,

  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.

     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.

IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,

      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.

   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.

      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,

    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.

    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,

    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.

  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.

 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.

    THE $1,000 QUESTION IS...

       LET ME TELL YOU HOW.
       YOU HAVE TWO CHEATS.

 YOU CAN PEEK OFF OF THEIR PAPER

    YOU CAN COPY THEIR PAPER.
      AND YOU HAVE ONE SAVE,

        IN A BAND, RIGHT?
I DID. NONE OF IRVING BERLIN'S

      YOUR BAND NEVER PLAYED
     ANY IRVING BERLIN SONGS?

       NO. NO.

  "STAND BESIDE HER

         COMING UP NEXT.

      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,
  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.

 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,

BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)

    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,
      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.

 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.
   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING

AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK

     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,
    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,

OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.
    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,

     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,
    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.

  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.
  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.

HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.
 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.

        title way back in '35.
  Actually it wasn't 1935, he

       SO THEN WE HAVE "F."

       SO I AM PRETTY SURE
          THAT IT'S "F."
YOU WANT TO LOCK THAT IN?
        I'M LOCKING IT IN.

   THE LETTER "F."
BEFORE YOU GO ANY FURTHER,
DOES THAT LETTER SOUND FAMILIAR
WITH ANY REPORT CARDS, MICHAEL?

           [ LAUGHTER ]
      I'M SORRY.
                    OUCH.

HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS --
 IF THAT IS CORRECT,
YOU ARE ALREADY THE BETTER HALF,
      ALL RIGHT?
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

            FOR $1,000
     AND THE CHANCE TO PROVE
       THAT YOU ARE SMARTER
       THAN YOUR HUSBAND...
    THE CORRECT ANSWER IS "F."

     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
     IT IS THE 4th CONSONANT
         IN THE ALPHABET.
      YOU DON'T CARE, RIGHT?

                IT'S GONNA BE
                A LONG NIGHT.
 HOPEFULLY.
 BUT IT'S ALL GOING IN THE SAME
 CHECKING ACCOUNT, RIGHT?
                            YES.
               YES.

   IS IT ALL GOING IN THE SAME
        CHECKING ACCOUNT?
YES, IT IS.
I WANT TO MAKE SURE.
ALL RIGHT, KELLY,
LET'S DON'T STOP AT $1,000.

LET'S DOUBLE IT RIGHT NOW.
      ALL RIGHT.
        OKAY.

     [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]
I THINK I'M GONNA GO FOR
2nd GRADE WORLD GEOGRAPHY.

        KELLY, FOR $2,000,
      HERE IS THE QUESTION.
     A FOUR-WORD QUESTION --
   "FRANCE BORDERS WHICH OCEAN?

          CLASSMATE KYLE
    HAS LOCKED IN HIS ANSWER.
        OKAY.
       YOU GET THIS RIGHT,

YOU PROVE YOU'RE TWICE
 AS SMART AS MICHAEL.
           [ LAUGHTER ]
WHAT'S YOUR THINKING?
HAVE YOU BEEN TO FRANCE?

I HAVE BEEN TO FRANCE, ACTUALLY.
       I HAVE BEEN THERE.
        AND I -- OH, GOD.
     I, UH...I WAS THINKING,

       YOU KNOW, IT BORDERS
 THE MEDITERRANEAN, I KNOW THAT.
        AND IF IT BORDERS
        ANY ACTUAL OCEAN,
       THEN IT'S GOT TO BE
       THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.

    SO I'M GOING TO LOCK IN...
         ATLANTIC OCEAN.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
              I HOPE IT'S RIGHT.

             LOOK AT
      THE BIG BOARD, KELLY.
        HERE IS THE ANSWER
        TO THE QUESTION...

         GOOD WORK, KYLE.

              ALL RIGHT.
      ALL RIGHT, YOUR CLASSMATES
           GET TO HELP YOU
        TWO QUESTIONS AT A TIME.

  KYLE DID A GREAT JOB, BUT IT'S
    TIME TO PICK ANOTHER ONE.
        OKAY,
I GOT MY EYE ON MARKI.
         MARKI, COME ON UP HERE.
