         We get cats.
         They're smart.

They can outsmart their humans..
       and their canines.
 So they deserve a smart choice
           in litter.

  We make Fresh Step scoopable
          with carbon
because carbon has tons of tiny
             pores
           that are trapping and
           eliminating odors.

Fresh Step.
Your cat deserves the best.

         BEFORE COPD...
      I TOOK MY SON FISHING
           EVERY YEAR.

      WE HAD A GREAT SPOT,
 NOT EASY TO FIND, BUT WORTH IT.
          BUT WITH COPD
   MAKING IT HARD TO BREATHE,
            I THOUGHT
    THOSE DAYS MIGHT BE OVER.

          SO MY DOCTOR
      PRESCRIBED SYMBICORT.
 IT HELPS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE
        MY LUNG FUNCTION
  STARTING WITHIN FIVE MINUTES.

    SYMBICORT DOESN'T REPLACE
        A RESCUE INHALER
      FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.
         WITH SYMBICORT,
   TODAY I'M BREATHING BETTER.

    AND THAT MEANS...FISH ON!
      SYMBICORT IS FOR COPD
  INCLUDING CHRONIC BRONCHITIS
         AND EMPHYSEMA.

     IT SHOULD NOT BE TAKEN
     MORE THAN TWICE A DAY.
SYMBICORT MAY INCREASE YOUR RISK
       OF LUNG INFECTIONS,
          OSTEOPOROSIS,
     AND SOME EYE PROBLEMS.

        TELL YOUR DOCTOR
  IF YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION
     OR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
        BEFORE TAKING IT.
      WITH COPD, I THOUGHT
 I'D MISS OUR FAMILY TRADITION.

   NOW SYMBICORT SIGNIFICANTLY
   IMPROVES MY LUNG FUNCTION,
   STARTING WITHIN 5 MINUTES.
   AND THAT MAKES A DIFFERENCE
        IN MY BREATHING.

       TODAY, WE'RE READY
   FOR WHATEVER SWIMS OUR WAY.
ASK YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT SYMBICORT.
  I GOT MY FIRST
PRESCRIPTION FREE.
