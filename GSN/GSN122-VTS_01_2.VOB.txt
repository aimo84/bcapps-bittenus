     WOULD YOU DESCRIBE AS
      VIAGRA ON A HANGER?
            BRENDAN.

  - UH, I THINK IT WOULD HAVE
     TO BE HER BLACK ROBE,
       BECAUSE SHE LOOKS
       VERY NICE IN THAT.
    - SHE LOOKS SMOKIN' HOT
      IN THAT BLACK ROBE.

   UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S FOR,
          SO IT'S ME.
             - OH.

         TO BE SO HAPPY
 THAT YOU SHARED THAT WITH US.

    - I'M SURE SHE WILL BE.
     - ALL RIGHT, BRENDAN.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 TROUBLE, AND I'M GONNA GO WITH

        WHEN SHE SLEEPS.

       BREATHING PATTERN.
  MAYBE A SNORE HERE OR THERE.

       - IT'S A DIFFERENT
        BREATHING SOUND.
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE IT.

    AN OCCASIONAL [snoring].

   IT'S JUST THAT SHE CRIES,
    AND SHE'S LIKE [crying].

          HERE WE GO.
     FILL IN THESE BLANKS.

   BEFORE MEETING MY HUSBAND,
       I NEVER KNEW A MAN
        WHO COULD BLANK.
  AND I'M SURE MY HUSBAND WAS
   SURPRISED TO MEET A WOMAN

           - ANJALAY.
- I WOULD SAY I NEVER MET A MAN
     WHO COULD BE SO SWEET.

         audience: OH!
AND I WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD
        GO THE SAME WAY.
     THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

     SO HE THOUGHT I COULD
          BE SO SWEET.
            - OKAY.
          - DANIELLE.
      - I NEVER MET A MAN

      WHO WOULD COME HOME
        RIGHT FROM WORK,
      AND GO RIGHT IN THE
    BATHROOM FOR 20 MINUTES.
           [laughter]

            I NEVER.
  AND I'LL SAY HE'S NEVER MET
   A GIRL THAT'S SO PERFECT.
      - THAT'S SO PERFECT.

     FARTIN' AND ALL, HUH?
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
            GOT YOU.
             DINA.

  - I DON'T THINK I COULD EVER
THOUGHT I'D FIND A MAN WHO'D BE
       SO WEIRD WITH ME,
  AND LIKE, JUST BE WEIRDNESS.
AND I'D THINK HE'D SAY THE SAME
        THING ABOUT ME.

THAT WE COULD JUST BE OURSELVES,
           AND BE...
     FREE TO BE YOU AND ME.
      - THAT'S SO AWESOME.

           [applause]
  YEAH, WHAT IS IT YOU GUYS DO
   THAT'S SO WEIRD TOGETHER?
     - WELL, BETWEEN ME AND
        YOU AND AMERICA,

 UM, LIKE, WHEN WE HAVE DINNERS
          AT OUR HOME,
  WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THE HOME,
  WE DO LIKE A DANCE TOGETHER.
           [laughter]

     - OKAY, SO YOU EMBRACE
    EACH OTHER'S WEIRDNESS.
      - YEAH, WE LOVE IT.
            WHY NOT?
          - I LOVE IT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.

       THANK YOU SO MUCH.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
       WE'RE GOING TO SEE

   LET US CHECK ON THE SCORE.
 JOSH AND DINA, YOU GUYS ARE IN
  FIRST PLACE WITH 15 POINTS.

           [applause]
   WE'VE STILL GOT A LOT MORE
           QUESTIONS.
    HERE IS THE FIRST OF OUR
      TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.

           GENTLEMEN.
    IF YOUR LITTLE PERFORMER
 WERE STARRING IN A HARDBOILED
          CRIME DRAMA,
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
        IT WOULD BE CAST

     AS THE STRAIGHT-LACED
           DETECTIVE,
        THE CROOKED COP,
    OR THE HOODED CRIMINAL?
            BRENDAN.

  - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH
 THE STRAIGHT-LACED PERFORMER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    ANJALAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - HOODED CRIMINAL.

          [indistinct]
  - NO, THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER.
        - I DON'T KNOW.
         I GOT NOTHING.
     - [laughing] SHE SAID

            DAMIEN.
- I WOULD SAY THE STRAIGHT-LACED
           PERFORMER,

   BECAUSE THE OTHER TWO ARE
      JUST NOT HAPPENING.
        - NOT HAPPENING.
      ALL RIGHT, DANIELLE.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

- THE STRAIGHT-LACED DETECTIVE.
           ALL RIGHT.
     JOSH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - UH, I'M GONNA' GO
     WITH THE CROOKED COP.

    UM, I JUST THINK THAT'S
          WHAT IT IS.
         I DON'T KNOW.
       - ALL RIGHT, DINA.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

     - HE'S MY CROOKED COP.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  OUR NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.

   HOW DID YOUR WIFE COMPLETE
         THIS SENTENCE?
IF I HAD A DOLLAR FOR EVERY TIME
MY HUSBAND SAID THE WORD BLANK,
     I'D BE A MILLIONAIRE.
            DAMIEN.

        - SAID I FORGOT.
          - ONE WORD.
       - OH, JUST FORGOT.
           - FORGOT?

            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT'D YOU SAY DANIELLE?
             - NO.
            FORGOT?

           ONE WORD?
        both: indistinct
    - I ALWAYS SAY I FORGOT.
         SO, I'M SORRY.

         THAT'S TWICE.
    [laughter and applause]
       - ALL RIGHT, JOSH.

- UM, I'M GOING TO GO WITH STOP.
UM, BECAUSE SOMETIMES SHE TRIES
 TO, LIKE, TWEEZE MY EYEBROWS,
   OR DO STUFF, AND I'M JUST
        LIKE STOP, STOP.

         I DON'T KNOW.
     - I MEAN, I HEAR THAT,
    BUT I HAVE TO SAY MAYBE.
      'CAUSE LIKE YOU SAY
     MAYBE FOR EVERYTHING.

         - RIGHT, YEAH.
       THAT MAY BE RIGHT.
    [laughter and applause]
           - BRENDAN.

       - I'M PRETTY SURE
        I GOT THIS ONE.
       I SAY FACE A LOT.
   IF I GET SOMETHING RIGHT,
   IF I GET SOMETHING WRONG,

     I JUST GO FACE, FACE.
     - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
      WHAT DOES FACE MEAN?
 - IT JUST MEANS I GOT IT RIGHT
        AND SHE'S WRONG.

            - OKAY.
    ANJALAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            - FACE.
      ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS.
         NEXT QUESTION.

 WE ASKED YOUR WIFE, EXCLUDING
  YOU, WHAT WAS THE FIRST NAME
    OF THE LAST MAN SHE HAD
    A SEXUAL FANTASY ABOUT.
   WHO DO YOU THINK SHE SAID?

             JOSH.
           - OH, WOW.
  UM, I'M GONNA GO WITH DAVID.
            - DAVID.
          WHO'S DAVID?

     - HE'S A FRIEND OF...
 GOT A LOT OF GOOD DANCE MOVES,
    AND SHE'S INTO DANCING.
            - DAVID.
            - YEAH.

  - DINA, YOU'VE BEEN THINKING
          ABOUT DAVID?
          YEAH, YEAH.
    [cheering and applause]

  - HAVE YOU BEEN EYEING THAT
          DAVID, DINA?
      - NO, I GOT MY MAN.
          - ALL RIGHT.
           ALL RIGHT.
    BRENDAN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY
      IT'S MY FRIEND MIKE.
      - YOUR FRIEND MIKE.
             - YES.
 HE'S A VERY GOOD LOOKING GUY.
  HE WAS ONE OF MY GROOMSMEN,

  AND EVERYONE AT THE WEDDING
 SAID, OH, YOU LOOK VERY NICE,
   BUT YOUR GROOMSMAN, MIKE,
            LOOKS...
              SO.
       - AT YOUR WEDDING?

 - WELL, ALL THE SINGLE GIRLS.
            - YEAH.
 ALL RIGHT, ANJALAY, WHAT'D YOU
              SAY?
  - I DO LIKE MIKE, BUT I WAS
    THINKING BRADLEY COOPER.

            - YEAH.
         THAT'S RIGHT.
           [laughter]
          - ALL RIGHT.
            DAMIEN.

     - I'M GONNA' SAY JOSH.
    BECAUSE OF JOSH DUHAMEL,
       BECAUSE SHE LIKES
      THAT SHOW <i>LAS VEGAS.</i>
             - YES.

  - SO, I'M GOING TO SAY JOSH.
      - IF IT'S ANYBODY--
 YOU LOOK SO SCARED RIGHT NOW.

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - I SAID JOSH DUHAMEL.
        - SHE SAID JOSH.

    [cheering and applause]
          both: WHOO!
     - I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.
         I'M SO PROUD.

      THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.
           [laughter]
  - LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.

     HOW DID YOUR WIFE FILL
        IN THESE BLANKS?
   BEFORE MEETING MY HUSBAND,
       I NEVER KNEW A MAN
        WHO COULD BLANK.

  AND I'M SURE MY HUSBAND WAS
   SURPRISED TO MEET A WOMAN
            BRENDAN.
   - I HAVE HONESTLY NO IDEA
   WHAT SHE IS GOING TO SAY.

 UM, I'M HOPING SHE'S GOING TO
      SAY SOMETHING SWEET
   LIKE LOVE ME AND LOVE HER.
             SO...
            - OKAY.

       SO SHE NEVER KNEW

- SHE NEVER MET A MAN WHO COULD
           COME HOME

          - I LOVE IT.
      YOU ARE READY TO GO.
         WELL, WE HAVE
   SENT YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE,

           SO WE CAN
    ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS.
        WE'RE GONNA GET
    RIGHT TO IT, GENTLEMEN.
      IF I WERE TO PEEK IN
ON A TYPICAL LOVEMAKING SESSION,

    BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU,
    WHERE WOULD I MOST OFTEN
     FIND YOUR WIFE'S FEET?
         DOWN BY YOURS,

        UP BY YOUR HEAD,
           OR TUCKED
     ALONGSIDE YOUR THIGHS?
            - RYAN?

         - OOH, SHERRI,
 I'D LIKE TO SAY UP BY MY HEAD
         BUT MY WIFE'S
   A LITTLE MORE TRADITIONAL.
    I'D SAY DOWN BY MY FEET.

      - DOWN BY YOUR FEET?
             - YUP.
     - ALL RIGHT, GABRIEL?
      - OH, MAN, YOU KNOW,

           WE LIKE TO
          KEEP IT FUN.
      LET'S KEEP IT REAL,
        I'D HAVE TO SAY
        UP BY THE HEAD.

     IS OUR NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
    THE OLDER MY WIFE GETS,

    THE MORE BLANK SHE GETS.
            GABRIEL?
 - I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
    THE OLDER MY WIFE GETS,

   THE MORE CORRECT SHE GETS.
       AND THE REASON WHY
         IS BECAUSE SHE
    STARTS TO FIGURE ME OUT,
         WHICH IS OKAY.

            - YEAH?
   - I NEED THAT CORRECTNESS
          IN MY LIFE,

         HARBOR RESORT.
     [cheers and applause]
        OKAY, THE WIVES
        HAVE JOINED US.

        WELCOME, LADIES.
             - HI.
     - WHILE YOU WERE GONE
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS

        THREE QUESTIONS
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
           TO TRY AND
      MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
       IS WORTH 5 POINTS,

     SO HERE WE GO, LADIES.
      IF I WERE TO PEEK IN
ON A TYPICAL LOVEMAKING SESSION
            BETWEEN
        THE TWO OF YOU,

   WHERE DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
         I'D MOST OFTEN
        FIND YOUR FEET?
          DOWN BY HIS,

        UP BY HIS HEAD,
OR TUCKED ALONGSIDE HIS THIGHS?
             JENNA?

         - DOWN BY HIS.
         - DOWN BY HIS?
      - [giggles] ALWAYS.
       - ALWAYS? ALWAYS?

          - [giggles]
      I LIKE IT LIKE THAT.
            - OKAY.
         RYAN, DOES SHE
       LIKE IT LIKE THAT?

   - I KNOW HOW SHE LIKES IT.
         - DOWN BY HIS!
     [cheers and applause]
         OKAY, PEITRA?

      - AROUND HIS THIGHS.
         - BECAUSE, UH,
      WE LIKE TO SNUGGLE.
           - GABRIEL?

           - WE LIKE
        TO HAVE FUN TOO.
         I MEAN, THAT'S
        AWESOME AS WELL.
           - [laughs]
- BUT WE LIKE TO HAVE SOME FUN.

        - NADEGE, LET'S
         GO ON TO YOU.
       - I WOULD SAY, UM,
         BY HIS THIGHS,
          BECAUSE IT'S
     NOT QUITE BY HIS HEAD,

      IT'S A LITTLE BIT--
   YOU KNOW, THAT MIGHT LAST
      ABOUT FIVE MINUTES.
       BUT PROBABLY RIGHT
         BY THE THIGHS

     IS A COMFORTABLE SPOT.
          - SO TUCKED
    ALONGSIDE THOSE THIGHS.
             - YES.
            - OKAY.

      WHAT'D YOU SAY, JOE?
          DOWN BY HIS.
         - THAT'S NOT--
   NO, THAT'S, LIKE, THAT'S--

        - ON YOUR BACK.
  - YEAH, BUT YOU GOTTA THINK
      THEY'RE NOT, LIKE--
       THEY'RE NOT, LIKE,
  STRAIGHT PLANKED, YOU KNOW?

    - WE GOT A DISAGREEMENT
    ON HOW FAR HER FEET GO.
            - OKAY.
- THAT'S A PLANK BY THE THIGHS,
    LIKE, THAT'S LIKE THIS.

         - SHE'S GOT IT
        ALL FIGURED OUT,
          I LOVE THAT.
           SO LADIES,
   HERE'S OUR NEXT QUESTION.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    THE OLDER MY WIFE GETS,
    THE MORE BLANK SHE GETS.

            PEITRA?
    - I THINK HE'S GONNA SAY
 I GET MORE AND MORE BEAUTIFUL.
   - MORE AND MORE BEAUTIFUL.
          - EVERY DAY.

           - GABRIEL?
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - MORE AND MORE CORRECT?
     - MORE AND MORE COR--
 YOU'RE MORE AND MORE BEAUTIFUL

          BUT YOU FIX
      A LOT OF MY ERRORS.
  AND I LIKE THAT A LOT, SO--
       I LIKE THAT A LOT.
          I LIKE THAT
       SHE HELPS ME OUT,

          I MEAN, SHE
   MAKES ME A BETTER PERSON.
AND THAT'S WHAT BEING MARRIED--
YOU KNOW, MARRIAGE IS ALL ABOUT.
             - YES.
             - AW.

        - THERE YOU GO.
         - I LOVE YOU.
       - I LOVE YOU, TOO.
           I'M SORRY.

   - NADEGE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - MORE BEAUTIFUL.
             - JOE?

           MORE SEXY.
             - HM.
    - OH, WE CAN'T TAKE IT.

             - OH.
    I AM HOT THOUGH, THANKS.
            [laughs]

       - SEXY IS THE BEST
  WRONG ANSWER YOU COULD GET.
         - I WAS CLOSE.
           - [laughs]
      - ALL RIGHT, JENNA?

        - I'M GONNA SAY
        MORE HOT I GET.
          - MORE HOT.
     - 'CAUSE I WAS LITTLE,
      I WAS REAL SKINNY--

         I'M, YOU KNOW,
      A LITTLE BIGGER NOW
          I'M GETTING
        A LITTLE OLDER.
     - UH-HUH, SO MORE HOT.
            - YEAH.

       - ALL RIGHT, RYAN,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
    - I SAID MORE BEAUTIFUL.
       - MORE BEAUTIFUL.
    - OOH, WELL, THANK YOU.

            - CLOSE.
       - LADIES, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
     WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND
      SAY HE'D ENJOY MOST

       ABOUT LIVING LIFE
           AS A LADY?
            NADEGE?
     - HAVING A BIG BOOTY,
    'CAUSE HE LIKES BOOTIES.

            - AAAAH!
           [laughter]
              WOW.

    I NEVER PICTURED YOU JOE
       WITH A BIG BOOTY.
   WITH THE BADUNKADUNK, HUH?
    - YEAH, HE'D BE, LIKE...

            - OKAY.
  - BACK IT UP IN THE MIRRORS.
           - [laughs]
         JOE, COULD YOU
      BACK THAT THANG UP?

         - LET ME SEE.
           - [sighs]
        - HE SAID PEOPLE
       BUYING HIM DRINKS.

        - WELL, I CAN'T
   DISAGREE WITH HER, BUT...
           [laughter]
     - I GOT ENOUGH TROUBLE
   DEALING WITH MY OWN BOOTY

          GETTING INTO
      MY PANTS, YOU KNOW?
            - YEAH.
            - YEAH?
      - WAH-WAH, WHATEVER.
            - JENNA?

   - I GET EVERYTHING I WANT,
      SO IF HE WAS A WOMAN
          HE WOULD GET
      EVERYTHING HE WANTS.
    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, RYAN?

           - [laughs]
      THAT'S KINDA CLOSE.
     - HE SAID THE ABILITY
 TO HAVE SEX WHENEVER HE WANTS.
            - WHAT?

          - I'M SORRY.
        YOU ARE A DIRTY,
       DIRTY GIRL, RYAN.
            BUT, OH,
          I LOVE YOU.

    PEITRA? WHAT ABOUT YOU?
          - GABRIEL'S
      A VERY GOOD DANCER,
            AND, UH,
      HE'S A GOOD LEADER.

          AND HE SAYS
      THE JOB OF THE MALE
           IS TO MAKE
      THE WOMAN LOOK GOOD.
            - MM-HM.

         - I THINK HE'D
        WANNA BE MADE--
     YOU KNOW, HE'D WANT ME
     TO MAKE HIM LOOK GOOD.
      ON THE DANCE FLOOR.

           - GABRIEL,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
          - NOT QUITE,
  BUT IT'S ALL ABOUT THE LADY
           AND MAKING
         HER FEEL NICE.

      - WINING AND DINING?
        - LOOK BEAUTIFUL
  AND TAKING YOU TO THE NICE--
           YOU KNOW,
     TO THE NICE RESTAURANT

       MAKE HER LOOK NICE
      ON THE DANCE FLOOR,
        MAKE HER LOOK--
   YOU KNOW, FEEL GLAMOROUS,
     YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

          SO CLOSE BUT
     JUST THE WRONG VENUE.
          - WELL, YOU
    MAKE ME LOOK GLAMOROUS.
            - YEAH.
         - THAT'S TRUE.

       - SO WHAT KINDA--
       WHAT KIND OF, UH,
      DANCING WOULD YOU--
WOULD YOU DO IF YOU WERE A LADY?
         - HOW ABOUT IF
     WE SALSA ON THE FLOOR?

        - I THINK THAT--
           - A SALSA?
     - THERE'S MORE SPACE.
     - CAN YOU DO A SALSA?

    - OKAY, SO YOU HAVE TO--
      SO PUT ON THE MUSIC,
           ALL RIGHT.
             AND...

     [cheers and applause]
           - WHOOOOO!
              OOH!

            WHOOOOO!
             YEAH!
             WHOO!

         WHOO! SOMEBODY
        BRING ME A FAN!
           ALL RIGHT,
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
        RYAN AND JENNA,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD

         WITH 5 POINTS.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS

  AND THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED,
      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,

  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.

     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.

IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,

      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.

   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.

      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,

    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.

    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,

    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.

  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.

 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.
         - WELCOME BACK
      TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
        IT IS YOUR TURN

   TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.
        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
      ARE YOU READY TO GO?
             - YES.

            - OKAY.
KNOWING YOUR HUSBAND'S APPETITE,
     WHAT FOOD FLAVOR COULD
       SCIENTISTS INJECT

       INTO YOUR PERFUME
          TO HAVE HIM
    CONSTANTLY CRAVING YOU?
             JENNA?

      - DEFINITELY STEAK,
  'CAUSE HE HAS TO HAVE MEAT--
           STEAK WITH
       EVERY SINGLE MEAL.
      - SO STEAK--PEITRA?

        - OH, I HAVE TO
       GO CLASSIC ON THIS
       AND SAY CHOCOLATE.
          - CHOCOLATE?

       - 'CAUSE HE WOULD
   PROBABLY LICK ME ALL DAY.
             - AAH.
     [cheers and applause]

           - NADEGE?
    - I HAVE TO SAY CHEESE.
         HE PUTS CHEESE
     ON, LIKE, EVERYTHING.
           - REALLY?
             - YES.

IT COULD BE MACARONI AND CHEESE,
   GOT A LITTLE EXTRA CHEESE.
     I'M, LIKE, CALM DOWN.
    - LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.

      COMPLETE THIS VERSE.
         ROSES ARE RED,
       VIOLETS ARE BLUE,
     WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK

           MY HUSBAND
      DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE.
            PEITRA?
    - THE MAN CANNOT SPELL.

          HE DOES NOT
      KNOW THE DIFFERENCE
         BETWEEN THEIR,
        THEY'RE, THERE.
          YOUR, YOU'RE
          AND YOU ARE.

      - BUT HE CAN DANCE,
       SO WHO CARES, HUH?
           - I KNOW.
           - NADEGE?
          - CLEANING.

       BECAUSE I TOLD HIM
     TO CLEAN THE BATHROOM.
          I CAME BACK.
      HE WENT TO THE STORE
 AND BOUGHT CLEANING SUPPLIES.

    AND NOTHING WAS CLEANED.
     - SO NO FOLLOW-THROUGH
       WITH THE CLEANING.
    - NO FOLLOW THROUGH, NO.
      - OKAY, NO CLEANING.

             JENNA?
    - DEFINITELY HIS CHORES.
         FOR CHRISTMAS
          I BOUGHT HIM

         A TO-DO LIST,
        AND I WROTE DOWN
       EVERY SINGLE CHORE
        THEY ASK TO DO--

      - NOTHING SAYS LOVE
 LIKE A TO-DO LIST, I LOVE IT.
           [laughter]
       - KEEP GOIN' GIRL.

           - AND HE--
     I COME HOME FROM WORK
         AND I'M, LIKE,
 SO WHAT'D YOU GET DONE TODAY?
        AND HE'S, LIKE,
      "UH, I PLAYED XBOX."

        - AW, ALL RIGHT.
        LADIES, THIS IS
       OUR NEXT QUESTION.
     WHAT DOES YOUR HUSBAND
       SPEND MORE TIME ON

   EVERY MORNING BEFORE WORK?
           HIS HAIR?
            EATING?

            OR YOU?
            NADEGE?
          - HIS HAIR.

           HE ASKS ME
    TO CHECK IT, EVERYTHING.
           - [laughs]
        - IS THAT RIGHT?
          IT IS OKAY?

          - ALL RIGHT.
             JENNA?
      - DEFINITELY EATING.

           HAVE YOU--
      YOU SAW HIM, RIGHT?
            - MM-HM.
           - [laughs]
        HE LOVES TO EAT,
         LOVES TO EAT.

            - YEAH?
    - SO DEFINITELY EATING.
          - OKAY, AND
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, PEITRA?
      - I WISH I COULD SAY
        IT WAS HIS HAIR.

    BUT MAYBE TEN YEARS AGO
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ANSWER.
            IT WOULD
     DEFINITELY BE EATING.
          - ALL RIGHT.

         WELL, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
           EACH PART
      IS WORTH 15 POINTS,

          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
    IF A PARROT WERE PERCHED
         IN OUR BEDROOM

      FOR THE LAST MONTH,
    THE PHRASE HE'D PICK UP
FROM MY HUSBAND WOULD BE BLANK.
          AND FOR ME,

    HE'D BE SQUAWKING BLANK.
             JENNA?
      - HE WOULD BE SAYING
     "DO YOU WANNA DO IT?"

       AND I WOULD SAY...
           [laughter]
     - HOW WOULD THAT SOUND
      AS A PARROT, JENNA?

           - [laughs]
         [parrot voice]
      DO YOU WANNA DO IT?

           [laughter]
     [cheers and applause]
       AND I--THE PARROT
        WOULD BE SAYING,

      FROM WHAT YOU WOULD
     HEAR FROM ME WOULD BE
         [parrot voice]
         NO, I'M TIRED.
     [cheers and applause]

   I'M A TEACHER, I'M TIRED.
            [laughs]
        - YOU GOT A LOT
     OF STUFF YOU'RE DOING.

            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.
            PEITRA?
    - DO YOU WANNA HAVE SEX?
     DO YOU WANNA HAVE SEX?

         - SOUNDS LIKE
         A SEXY PARROT.
      [sexy parrot voice]
      YOU WANNA HAVE SEX?
        - AND, UH, YEAH!

     - [sexy parrot voice]
     DO YOU WANNA HAVE SEX?
     - AND, UH, THE PARROT
   WOULD PROBABLY BE, UH, SAY
        - [parrot voice]
   NOT NOW,OT NOW, NOT NOW.

       - [laughs] NADEGE?
    - THE PARROT WOULD SAY,
   JUST SAY, "I'M TOO TIRED."
          AND THEN ME,
       PARROT WOULD SAY,

           "ME TOO."
           [laughter]
     [cheers and applause]

      - LADIES, THANK YOU.

  OF OUR TEN POINT QUESTIONS.

     KNOWING YOUR APPETITE,
        WHAT FOOD FLAVOR
  DID YOUR WIFE SAY SCIENTISTS
          COULD INJECT
        INTO HER PERFUME

          TO HAVE YOU
    CONSTANTLY CRAVING HER?
             RYAN?
            - STEAK.
     I LOVE--LOVE RED MEAT.

         I COULD EAT IT
       THREE MEALS A DAY,
        EVERY DAY UNTIL
    I DIE OF A HEART ATTACK.
           - [laughs]

      - AND I'D BE HAPPY.
    - JENNA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      YOU LOVE YOUR STEAK!
     [cheers and applause]

          - ALL RIGHT.
    GABRIEL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       GO WITH CHOCOLATE.

   - PEITRA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
          - CHOCOLATE!
       - OOH, THAT'S WHAT
    I'M TALKING ABOUT, YEAH!

             NICE.
            - OKAY.

       I KNOW EVERYBODY--
  YOU GUYS LIKE CHEESE, RIGHT?
        I MEAN, COME ON.
         - YOU'RE GONNA
        GO WITH CHEESE.

            NADEGE?
           - CHEESE!
     [cheers and applause]

       - GOOD JOB, BABY.
          - ALL RIGHT,
   GENTLEMEN, NEXT QUESTION.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
      COMPLETE THIS VERSE?

         ROSES ARE RED,
       VIOLETS ARE BLUE,
    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK,
           MY HUSBAND
      DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE.

            GABRIEL?
      - CHANGING DIAPERS?
        - WHEN IT COMES
      TO CHANGING DIAPERS.
           - WE HAVE
     A LITTLE BABY AT HOME.

      - AND YOU DON'T LIKE
       CHANGING DIAPERS?
  - WELL, MAYBE I DON'T DO IT
AS MUCH AS I SHOULD TO HELP OUT.
            - OKAY.

    WHAT'D YOU SAY, PEITRA?
          - SPELLING.
           - OH, NO!
        YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

       OH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
        - YOU ARE, LIKE,
THE WORST SPELLER IN THE WORLD.
           - I KNOW!
          - OKAY, JOE?

   - I'M NOT A MISTER FIX-IT,
       BUT I'M LEARNING.
          - ALL RIGHT.
- SO I'D PROBABLY SAY, YOU KNOW,
    THINGS AROUND THE HOUSE,

      THAT KIND OF STUFF,
         FIXING THINGS.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    NADEGE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
