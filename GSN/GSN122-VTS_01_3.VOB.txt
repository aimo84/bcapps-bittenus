NG.

 WHY WOULD I PUT YOU OUT THERE,
LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO--
          YOU CAN, UH,
   YOU SPACKLED A LITTLE BIT.
       - ALL RIGHT, RYAN?

      I HAVEN'T GOT A CLUE
    BECAUSE THAT'S ONE THING
        THAT ESCAPES ME,
  I CAN SPACKLE, I CAN SPELL,
            I CAN...

           [laughter]
  BUT SOMEHOW FOLDING CLOTHES
      IT JUST ESCAPED ME.

    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, JENNA?
           - CHORES.
    - SHE SAID YOUR CHORES.
        THAT IS A CHORE.
       YES, YOU HAVE IT.

           - [laughs]
            - WHOO!
     [cheers and applause]
          - ALL RIGHT,
    HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.

     WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY
     YOU SPEND MORE TIME ON
   EVERY MORNING BEFORE WORK?
           YOUR HAIR,

        EATING, OR HER?
              JOE?
    - I'M GONNA SAY MY HAIR.

 - SO HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE YOU
    TO GET THE MASTERPIECE?
      - OH, NOT THAT LONG.
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE TEN MINUTES.
  NADEGE, YOU'RE MAKING FACES,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       - I SAID HIS HAIR.
          - YOUR HAIR.
            - BABY!
   - IT'S A LITTLE BIT LONGER
    THAN TEN MINUTES THOUGH.

            - YEAH.
            - IS IT?
           - HOW LONG
       DOES IT TAKE HIM?
          - OKAY, 15,
       ADD ANOTHER FIVE.

      - I'LL GO WITH THAT.
            - OKAY.
   - COULD BE ABOUT 15 MAYBE,
         I DON'T KNOW.
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH
        FOLDING LAUNDRY.

            - RYAN?
         - I GO TO WORK
   RIGHT AFTER SHE GETS HOME,
         I WORK NIGHTS.

   SO, UM, WE SEE EACH OTHER
    FOR, LIKE, HALF AN HOUR
    AND IN THAT HALF AN HOUR
         WE ALWAYS EAT.

          SO I'M GONNA
          GO WITH EAT.
           [laughter]
            - JENNA?

            EATING!
           - EATING!
           - [laughs]
            - OKAY.

            GABRIEL?
      WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
       WHAT DO YOU THINK?
         I DON'T KNOW.

             SO...
           [laughter]
       I'M VERY SPECIFIC
       WITH MY MORNINGS,

   AND SOMETHING I DEFINITELY
        TAKE TIME TO DO
       IS SAY, YOU KNOW,
      BYE-BYE TO MY WIFE.
     - SOMEHOW I SEE, LIKE,

        A MORNING MAMBO
       GOIN' ON AS WELL.
- YOU WOULD BE CORRECT, I THINK.
     - SO IT'S PEITRA, HUH?
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

  - BUT FOOD IS VERY IMPORTANT
     TO YOU, I SAID EATING.
          - OH, FOOD,
     I DON'T EAT THAT MUCH.
- YOU HAVE, LIKE, A HEART ATTACK
   IF YOUR EGGS AREN'T READY.

          - ALL RIGHT,
  SO LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.

          IT IS WORTH
        UP TO 30 POINTS.
         ARE YOU READY?

             - YES.
            - OKAY.
         - LET'S DO IT.
     - YEAH, LET'S DO THIS.
          - GENTLEMEN,
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
          IF A PARROT
  WERE PERCHED IN OUR BEDROOM
      FOR THE LAST MONTH,

    THE PHRASE HE'D PICK UP
        FROM MY HUSBAND
        WOULD BE BLANK.
          AND FOR ME,

    HE'D BE SQUAWKING BLANK.
            GABRIEL?
      - PICKING UP FROM ME
   HE WOULD SAY, "OH, YEAH."

          "OH, YEAH,"
THE PARROT WOULD GO "OH, YEAH."
        - AND THAT'S HOW
    THAT PARROT WOULD SOUND?
      "OH, YEAH, OH, YEAH"

    - "OH, YEAH, OH, YEAH."
            - OKAY.
         - AND FROM HER
       IT WOULD PICK UP,

   "THAT'S NICE, THAT'S NICE"
        - "THAT'S NICE."
             - YES.
           - PEITRA?

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
         [parrot voice]
    "DO YOU WANNA HAVE SEX?
     DO YOU WANNA HAVE SEX?
           NOT NOW."

         - AND I'D SAY,
   [parrot voice] "NOT NOW."
        - UH, I'M SORRY,
   YOU DIDN'T GET ANY POINTS
          BUT YOU HAVE
         A LOT OF TIME

         TO GO IN THERE
         AND PRACTICE.
     WITH WHAT THAT PARROT
        WOULD BE SAYING.
   - I THINK SO, I THINK SO.
      - WE WILL, WE WILL.

         - ABSOLUTELY.
        ALL RIGHT, JOE?
     - I WOULD SAY FOR ME,
          IT WOULD SAY

          "GET THAT,"
      SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
        - CAN YOU SAY IT
         IN YOUR BEST--
     CAN YOU GIVE IT TO ME
   IN YOUR BEST PARROT VOICE?

         [parrot voice]
     "GET THAT, GET THAT."
           - [laughs]
            - UM...

    AND FOR HER I WOULD SAY,
         "DON'T STOP."
     [cheers and applause]

      - NOW TELL ME, JOE,
       HOW WOULD A PARROT
           SAY THAT?
           - [laughs]

         [parrot voice]
         "DON'T STOP."
           [laughter]
      - HEY, I'M TRYING TO
   MAKE IT SOUND RIGHT, SO...

          SO GET THAT
        AND DON'T STOP.
            NADEGE?
         - DON'T STOP,
         GET IT WRONG.

           I'M TIRED.
             - AW.
    - WE'VE BEEN TIRED, JOE.
        - WE HAVE BEEN,
          THAT'S TRUE.

  - WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT,
     WE NEED TO TRY HARDER.
  - SHE'S TRAVELING FOR WORK,
         AND, YOU KNOW,
   I'M WORKING LONG TOO, UGH.

        - [parrot voice]
     I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
            - YEAH.
       - CONGRATULATIONS,
        RYAN AND JENNA,

   YOU GUYS ARE OUR WINNERS.
      - BUT WAIT A MINUTE.
          RYAN IN YOUR
       BEST PARROT VOICE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
        - WHAT WOULD HE
      BE GETTING FROM YOU?
        - [parrot voice]
  COME ON, BABY, LET'S DO IT!

           [laughter]
    - AND THEN HE WOULD GET
          FROM JENNA--
     - [parrot voice] OKAY!

           [laughter]
   - JENNA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - DO YOU WANNA DO IT?
         NO, I'M TIRED.

         - HALF RIGHT!
       - CONGRATULATIONS,

           I'M NUTS.
       HELLO AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>

  HELLO, FELLAS. HOW ARE YOU?
            - GOOD.
          - I'M READY.
     - OKAY, WELL, WE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE

      SO WE COULD ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS,
       SO WE'RE GONNA GET
         RIGHT INTO IT.
  GENTLEMEN, WHEN IT COMES TO
   NUDE PHOTOS OF YOUR WIFE,

   HOW MANY HAVE YOU TAKEN--
             NONE,
         ENOUGH TO FILL
     YOUR COMPUTER DESKTOP,
       OR ENOUGH TO START
       YOUR OWN WEB SITE?

            CHEYNE.
     - HMM. I'D HAVE TO SAY
         ENOUGH TO FILL
     YOUR COMPUTER DESKTOP.

     - YOU GOT A BIG SMILE
         ON YOUR FACE.
     - I DO. WELL, THERE IS
      THE HONEYMOON, SO...
        - OKAY. KHADIR.

   - UM, I THINK I WOULD HAVE
          TO SAY NONE.
            - NONE.
             - YES.
     - OKAY, WELL, YOU GOT
  YOUR WHOLE MARRIAGE. RICKY.

      - UH, ENOUGH TO FILL
    THE DESKTOP, DEFINITELY.
 - ENOUGH TO FILL THE DESKTOP?
          - OH, YEAH.
     - I HOPE IT'S PASSWORD
        PROTECTED. YEAH.

  - YEAH, I GOTTA DOUBLE-CHECK
THAT, NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT.
       - OKAY. GENTLEMEN,
        SECOND QUESTION.
       WE KNOW YOU THINK
    SHE'S A DELICATE FLOWER,

     BUT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY
     IS THE MANLIEST THING
        ABOUT YOUR WIFE?
            KHADIR.
      - THE WAY THAT SHE'S
      REALLY INTO SPORTS,

      AND SHE LIKES A LOT
   OF DIFFERENT SPORTS TEAMS.
         - OKAY. RICKY.
     - UM, SHE'S MORE HANDY
           THAN I AM.

    SHE CAN FIX EVERYTHING.
   I CAN'T, LIKE, YOU KNOW--
     SHE ACTUALLY DOES ALL,
    LIKE, THE HEAVY LIFTING
      AND STUFF LIKE THAT,
       HANGIN' UP STUFF,

   SO SHE'S DEFINITELY MORE--
 - SO WHAT'S YOUR STRONG SUIT?
  DO YOU JUST CLEAN THE HOUSE?
- WE BUILT A BAR IN THE HOUSE--
  - SO YOU SERVE THE DRINKS...
  - YEAH, I SERVE THE DRINKS.

      - AND YOU LET HER DO
     THE HEAVY STUFF, HUH?
        - YEAH, EXACTLY.
      - ALL RIGHT. CHEYNE.
- SHE LIKES TO PLAN EVERYTHING,
 SHE LIKES TO BE THE VOCAL ONE,

    SO I WOULD SAY SHE LIKES
       TO BE IN CONTROL.
   - YEAH, YOU JUST GO ALONG
          AND LET HER?
        - I'VE LEARNED.
            - OKAY.

     VERY SMART. ALL RIGHT.
       THIS IS OUR FINAL
      QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--

      IF MY WIFE CAME WITH
    AN INSTRUCTION BOOKLET,
   IT WOULD SAY, "TO TURN ON,
       USE BLANK." RICKY.

- HMM. I DON'T KNOW. IT'S WEIRD.
    SHE'S NOT ONE FOR BEING
 ROMANTIC, ANYTHING LIKE THAT,
   SO I USUALLY DON'T DO IT.
 - PROBABLY 'CAUSE YOU MAKE HER
   DO ALL THE HEAVY LIFTING.

 - TRUST ME, WHEN YOU MEET HER,
   YOU'LL SEE WHY, BUT, UM...
 - ANYTHING THAT TURNS HER ON.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE ROMANTIC.
  ANYTHING THAT TURNS HER ON.

 - PROBABLY--I DON'T EVEN KNOW.
        I... [whistling]
         TYIN' HER UP.
       - WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        - TYIN' HER UP.

      GOTTA TAKE IT THERE.
    I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE.
             - WOW.
      - I KNOW WE'RE GONNA
          DEFINITELY--

       - ALL RIGHT, WOW.
            CHEYNE.
      - I'LL GO BACK RUB.
     - THE BACK RUB. OKAY.

            KHADIR.
 - YOU KIND OF STOLE MY ANSWER.
    - STICK WITH WHAT WORKS
     - UM, I'D BE A LITTLE
         MORE SPECIFIC.
    I'LL SAY A FOOT MASSAGE.

      - THE FOOT MASSAGE.
     WHO STOLE YOUR ANSWER?
   YOU WANTED TO TIE HER UP?
   FELLAS, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

  NICE JOB. I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,

    SO STUNNING IN YOUR RED.
  THIS IS YOUR WEDDING DRESS?
         - UH, IT WAS.

          - I LOVE IT.
          - THANK YOU.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS

  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
       IS WORTH 5 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

    LADIES, WHEN IT COMES TO
      NUDE PHOTOS OF YOU,
   HOW MANY DID YOUR HUSBAND
        SAY HE'S TAKEN--
      NONE, ENOUGH TO FILL
     HIS COMPUTER DESKTOP,

       OR ENOUGH TO START
       HIS OWN WEB SITE?
            VANESSA.
     - WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE
          TO SAY NONE,

         AND IF HE DID,
   THERE'S GONNA BE TROUBLE,
     SO IT BETTER BE NONE.
    - YOU SAY--YOU SAY NONE.
      - IT BETTER BE NONE.
       - OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

         WELL, CHEYNE--
        - I SAID ENOUGH
      TO FILL MY DESKTOP.
 - ENOUGH TO FILL HIS DESKTOP.
            - WH?

          - HONEYMOON.
         - MAYBE WHILE
   YOU WERE SLEEPIN', GIRL...
            - WHAT?
     - HE WAS TAKIN' PIC--

    - HONEYMOON IN THE POOL.
        - YOU GOT--OHH.
        - OHH, DARN IT.
     - THAT OLD HONEYMOON.
   - COME ON. THAT'S PRIVATE.

  - GIRL, NOTHIN' IS PRIVATE.
   THIS IS <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
    - I SEE, I SEE NOW. GOD.
          - OKAY. LIZ.

    - I'D HAVE TO SAY NONE,
     BECAUSE WE TAKE A LOT
   OF SELF-PORTRAIT PICTURES
         OF OURSELVES,
     BUT WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN
         FULLY CLOTHED.

      - OKAY, SO YOU HAVE
       THE NICE PICTURES.
            - YEAH.
        - YOU SAY NONE.
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, KHADIR?

             NONE.
          DONNA MARIE.
- YEAH, I'M GONNA SAY WEB SITE.

    - WHOA, ON THE WEB SITE.
           ALL RIGHT.
         - DON'T JUDGE.
  - LET'S SEE WHAT RICKY SAID.
           - SHOW IT?

 - ENOUGH TO FILL THE DESKTOP.
            - FAIL.
         WHAT'D YOU DO
     WITH THE REST OF 'EM?
        - I DIDN'T KNOW
      THERE WAS THAT MANY.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       OUR NEXT QUESTION.
  WE KNOW YOUR HUSBAND THINKS
   YOU'RE A DELICATE FLOWER,
     BUT WHAT DID HE SAY IS
 THE MANLIEST THING ABOUT YOU?

              LIZ.
    - THE WAY I LOVE SPORTS.
   - KHADIR, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

   HE SAID SHE'S INTO SPORTS.
             - YES!
    - THAT WAS AN EASY ONE.
   - DONNA MARIE. HEY, GIRL.

    WE KNOW HE THINKS OF YOU
     AS A DELICATE FLOWER.
            - YEAH.
   - ARE YOU HAVING A GOOD--
 I SAW THAT LOOK ON YOUR FACE.

  WHAT DID HE SAY IS THE MOST
   MANLIEST THING ABOUT YOU?
 - I KIND OF AM THE ALPHA MALE
  OF THE HOUSE. SORRY. IT IS.
             - HEY.
       - HEY, I INSTALLED

 THE CEILING FAN. I DON'T KNOW
       WHAT TO TELL YOU.
          UM, MY WALK.
             - MMM.
          - YOUR WALK?
        - I STOMP AROUND

      LIKE A TYRANNOSAUR,
   SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO--
         - YOUR WALK--
      CAN I SEE YOUR WALK?
  CAN YOU DO IT IN YOUR DRESS?
     - IT'S REALLY AWKWARD.

YOU DIDN'T SEE IT ON THE WAY IN?
    - IN YOUR WEDDING DRESS?
      CAN I SEE THE WALK?
         - THIS IS NOT
HOW YOU SHOULD WALK IN A DRESS.
          - I LOVE IT.

  THERE'S SOMETHING QUITE SEXY
          ABOUT THAT.
   GO ON, DO YOUR WALK, GIRL.
         THERE YOU GO.
     RICKY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       SHE'S MORE HANDY.
    - LIKE THE CEILING FAN.
            - YEAH.
          - OH, FAIL.
    I SHOULD HAVE SAID THAT.

   - YOU WERE ON IT, YOU WERE
      ON IT. SORRY, DUDE.
     - DON'T WORRY, RICKY.
  YOU GOT TIME TO MAKE IT UP.
         OKAY, VANESSA.

- I AM GOING TO HAVE TO GO WITH
     THE FACT THAT I ALWAYS
 HAVE TO DRIVE, BE IN CONTROL,
       THINGS LIKE THAT.
   - CHEYNE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

        - CONTROL FREAK.
 - SHE LIKES TO BE IN CONTROL.
             YEAH.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.

       THIS IS OUR FINAL
       QUESTION, LADIES.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
      IF MY WIFE CAME WITH
    AN INSTRUCTION BOOKLET,

   IT WOULD SAY, "TO TURN ON,
          USE BLANK."
          DONNA MARIE.

     - [sighs] SO AWKWARD.
       WHIPS AND CHAINS.
      - WHIPS AND CHAINS?

    - WELL, A LITTLE BONDAGE
      NEVER HURT ANYBODY.
  EXCEPT, YOU KNOW, THE PERSON
   GETTING, YOU KNOW, BOUND.
       - GETTIN' BONDED.

           ALL RIGHT.
     RICKY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
    RICKY SAID TYIN' HER UP.

      THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.
        - YEAH, FINALLY!
          - GOOD JOB.
            - YEAH!
            VANESSA.
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO--

  I MEAN, IT'S ROUNDABOUT, BUT
IT'S CALLED OUR SUNDAY BENDERS.
           ALL RIGHT.
   - THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT.
     PUT IT THIS WAY--IT'S
    OUR FUN DAY OF THE WEEK.

      - IT'S THE FUN DAY.
            - YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT, CHEYNE,
    DID YOU SAY THE FUN DAY?
    - I WAS TRYIN' TO LEAVE
    BENDERS OUT OF IT, BUT--

        - THE BACK RUBS.
       - GOIN' BACK RUB.
           - REALLY?
       - ALL RIGHT. LIZ.
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH,
         UM, MASSAGES,

   JUST BECAUSE, UM, KHADIR'S
      FABULOUS AT THEM...
            - WHOO.
   - AND I'M SUPPOSED TO GET
   A FOOT RUB EVERY MONDAY--
      EVERY OTHER MONDAY.

HOWEVER, KHADIR BENDS IT AROUND
       SO THAT, YOU KNOW,
 "OH, YOU GOT ONE LAST MONDAY,"
 OR "IT DIDN'T REALLY HAPPEN,"
OR HE TRIES TO GET OUT OF IT...

            - WHAT?
  - BUT I ALWAYS COLLECT THEM.
  - OHH, SO IT'S EVERY MONDAY.
     - EVERY OTHER MONDAY.

             - YES.
   WHAT DID YOU SAY, KHADIR?
      A FOOT MASSAGE. YES.

         - I LOVE YOU.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
  KHADIR AND LIZ, YOU GUYS ARE

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      IT IS NOW YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.
     THESE NEXT 3 ARE WORTH
        10 POINTS EACH.

      ARE YOU GUYS READY?
             - YEP.
  - LADIES, THEY SAY THE SUIT
         MAKES THE MAN,
      SO WHAT KIND OF SUIT

     DO YOU THINK YOUR MAN
      LOOKS HIS BEST IN--
        A BUSINESS SUIT,
        A BATHING SUIT,
     OR HIS BIRTHDAY SUIT?

            VANESSA.
  - I'M GONNA GO WITH BUSINESS
   SUIT, AND THE MAIN REASON
 IS BECAUSE I JUST THINK A MAN
    IN A SUIT IS JUST SEXY,

    AND I THINK CHEYNE LOOKS
       SO SEXY IN A SUIT.
       - ALL RIGHT. LIZ.
    - I'M GONNA ALSO GO WITH
         BUSINESS SUIT.

  I--NOTHING TURNS ME ON MORE
  THAN KHADIR IN A TIE, SO...
      - OKAY. DONNA MARIE.
   - UM, I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE
         BUSINESS SUIT.

       - A BUSINESS SUIT.
- I KNOW HOW HE THINKS, I THINK.
 - SO HE'S GONNA BE THINKING...
        - BUSINESS SUIT.
       - HE LOOKS SEXIER
      IN A BUSINESS SUIT.

  - YEAH, HE DOESN'T THINK HE
LOOKS GOOD IN HIS BIRTHDAY SUIT.
         - BUT YOU DO.
            - YEAH.
        - YEAH. LADIES,
       OUR NEXT QUESTION.

     IF FUTURE GENERATIONS
    WERE TO ERECT A MONUMENT
   IN HONOR OF YOUR HUSBAND,
        WHAT WOULD IT BE
        IN THE SHAPE OF?

              LIZ.
   - UM, I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
    WITH A HEART, BECAUSE--
            all: AW.
          - I-I KNOW,

    IT'S SO CHEESE-TASTIC...
    - AW, THIS IS SO SWEET.
  - BUT, UM, KHADIR HAS, LIKE,
    THE BIGGEST HEART EVER,
  AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS
     I LOVE MOST ABOUT HIM

   IS HIS UNCONDITIONAL LOVE
            FOR ME.
  - I LOVE THAT. DONNA MARIE.
       - WELL, WHEN A MAN
     HAS CERTAIN SKILLS...

          - ALL RIGHT.
      - THAT TAKE PLACE IN
        A CERTAIN AREA--

- I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE THAT
         INTO A STATUE.
        OH! OH, I KNOW.
   UM, CAN YOU MAKE A STATUE
        OF THE ALPHABET?

 - THE STATUE OF THE ALPHABET.
   - WELL, SAM KINISON ALWAYS
      DID THIS GREAT BIT--
 IF YOU REALLY WANT TO IMPRESS
  A WOMAN, LICK THE ALPHABET.

        - OH, FROM--OHH.
     - AND IT REALLY WORKS.
           - [laughs]
            VANESSA.

   - HE'S AN AMAZING WRITER.
 HE BLOGS, HE DOES EVERYTHING.
    I READ THINGS HE WRITES
      AND I'M LIKE, "WOW."
            - OKAY.
- LIKE, JUST SO SUPER IMPRESSED,

SO I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING HE'S
ALWAYS GONNA BE REMEMBERED FOR.
    - SO WHAT IS THE STATUE
        IN THE SHAPE OF?
- IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY'S WRITING,
  SO A PAGE, A PIECE OF PAPER

      WITH A PEN, LIKE A--
 - A PIECE OF PAPER WITH A PEN.
  - YEAH, YOU KNOW, YOU COULD
  MAKE THAT A STATUE, I GUESS.
     - OKAY. YEAH, I THINK
        HE'LL SAY THAT.

   - YEAH, YEAH, I THINK SO.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
    WHO DO YOU HAVE A BETTER
      RELATIONSHIP WITH--

 YOUR BOSS, YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND,
     OR YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW?
          DONNA MARIE.
         - I DON'T HAVE

    A BAD RELATIONSHIP WITH
  MY MOTHER-IN-LAW, BUT I HAVE
   AN EXCELLENT RELATIONSHIP
     WITH MY EX-BOYFRIEND.
   - WITH YOUR EX-BOYFRIEND.
            - YEAH.

       - WHAT'S HIS NAME?
          - UH, DEAN.
   DEAN. ALL RIGHT. VANESSA.
     - I'M GOING TO GO WITH
       MY MOTHER-IN-LAW,
     BECAUSE, FIRST OF ALL,

       I DO KEEP IN TOUCH
 WITH ONE OF MY EX-BOYFRIENDS,
AND THAT'S FINE AND EVERYTHING,
      BUT WE'RE NOT CLOSE.
      IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT
 ANYTHING TO DO WITH HIS LIFE,

      AND MY BS--I HOPE
      HE DOESN'T SEE THIS.
HE DOESN'T DO MUCH FOR ME, SO...
          - OKAY. LIZ.
        - UM, DEFINITELY
       MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.

            - YEAH?
      - UM, BECAUSE I LEFT
  MY EX-BOYFRIEND FOR KHADIR,
             SO...
    - OH, SO--BUT I GUESS--

    I'M TAKIN' IT, YOU GUYS
      AREN'T ALL FRIENDS.
             - NO.
          - OH, OKAY.
 - YEAH. IF HE GETS THAT WRONG,
     I DON'T--WE'RE DRIVIN'

   SEPARATE CARS HOME, 'CAUSE
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE WOULD SAY.
  - IT IS YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW.
             - YES.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
  HERE IS OUR BONUS QUESTION.

   IT HAS 2 PARTS. EACH PART
IS WORTH 15 POINTS. HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
       IN LOVE, YOU GOTTA
       PICK YOUR BATTLES,

      SO I BITE MY TONGUE
    WHEN MY HUSBAND BLANKS,
   AND HE LOOKS THE OTHER WAY
         WHEN I BLANK.

            VANESSA.
       - I BITE MY TONGUE
        WHEN HE'S SLOW.
       NOT ALL THE TIME,
  BECAUSE IT'S ALL THE TIME...

           - MM-HMM.
      - BUT IT TAKES A LOT
  TO NOT CONSTANTLY BE ANNOYED
     ABOUT THE SLOWNESS...
             - YES.
     - 'CAUSE I'M NOT SLOW,

AND HE PROBABLY BITES HIS TONGUE
    ABOUT MY SHOES ALL OVER
  THE DAMN HOUSE--DARN HOUSE.
             - LIZ.
    - SO FOR THE FIRST PART,

      I WOULD SAY SNORING.
          - IS IT BAD?
 - I SLEEP IN THE DEN, USUALLY
   THREE OR FOUR DAYS A WEEK.
- HE'S THAT LOUD WHEN HE SNORES?

          - MM-HMM, SO
  IT'D DEFINITELY BE SNORING,
       AND, UM, HE WOULD
      LOOK THE OTHER WAY,
      UM, WHEN I PROBABLY

    PEE WITH THE DOOR OPEN.
          - WHEN--AH.
  WHEN YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM
      WITH THE DOOR OPEN.
     - I USUALLY ONLY DO IT
IF HE LEAVES THE TOILET SEAT UP.

        - KHADIR. OKAY.
          DONNA MARIE.
         - I WOULD SAY
      I LOOK THE OTHER WAY
        WHEN HE DRIVES,

      AND MOSTLY IT MEANS
     I KEEP MY EYES CLOSED.
   - AND THEN HE'S GOTTA LOOK
 THE OTHER WAY WHEN YOU BLANK.
        - PROBABLY WHEN

    I GET BELLIGERENT DRUNK.
           - [laughs]
   THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES.

       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
    YOU LOOK YOUR BEST IN--

     OR YOUR BIRTHDAY SUIT?
            CHEYNE.

         ALL MY SUITS,
     BUT I'M GONNA GO WITH

      MY BIRTHDAY SUIT...
             - AH.
   - SHE'S ALWAYS TELLIN' ME
    I CAN LOSE A FEW POUNDS,

      SO I'M GONNA GO WITH
         BUSINESS SUIT.
  - ALL RIGHT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            - YEAH.

         - OKAY, RICKY,

    - I KNOW, YEAH, WELL...
     - BUT OF COURSE I LIKE
 YOUR BIRTHDAY SUIT, BUT I KNOW

  YOU WOULD SAY BUSINESS SUIT
AND THEN YOU SAID BIRTHDAY SUIT.
- SEE, I COULD HAVE DID WHAT YOU
SAID AND YOU THINK WHAT I SAID.
     - STOP TRYING TO THINK
      OF WHAT I WOULD SAY.

      - I LOVE HOW YOU TWO
    WORK IT OUT. I LOVE IT.
        OKAY, GENTLEMEN,
     IF FUTURE GENERATIONS
    WERE TO ERECT A MONUMENT
        IN HONOR OF YOU,

     WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY
  IT WOULD BE IN THE SHAPE OF?
            KHADIR.
       - IT'D BE AN EXACT
         REPLICA OF ME.

          - ALL RIGHT.
     LIZ, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - IT WOULD BE IN THE SHAPE
          OF A HEART.
       - A HEART, HONEY.
     YOU HAVE A BIG HEART.

    - RICKY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - UM, I'M NOT SURE.
IT'D BE THE IMAGE OF ME DANCING
   IN MY UNDERWEAR, OR A BAR.

  - OH, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU LIKE
         DANCING AROUND
       IN YOUR UNDERWEAR.
  - YOU KNOW, WHEN SHE'S DOING
  SOMETHING ON THE COMPUTER...

YOU KNOW, I JUST GO ALONGSIDE--
   - IS THERE A CERTAIN DANCE
    YOU DO? CAN YOU SHOW ME?
             - OH--
    - YEAH, YOU HAVE TO NOW.

      - OH, YEAH, COME ON.
     - AND YOU DESERVE IT.
  - NO, I JUST--ONE OF THESE.
      - DO THE--OHH, YEAH.
  - IN THE--IN YOUR UNDERWEAR,
SOCKS, AND, LIKE, A WRISTWATCH,

       IT'S REALLY FUNNY.
 - KIND OF LIKE THAT TOM CRUISE
         KIND OF THING.
      - KIND OF--NOT SO--
          - NOT QUITE.
 - NOT NEARLY AS GOOD-LOOKING.

    - IN YOUR OWN RICKY WAY.
         - A MONUMENT.
         - A MONUMENT,
     I'D HOPE TO SAY A BAR.

       WITH THAT, RICKY?
    - YEAH, NOW I DO, YEAH.
             - AHH.
        - I DON'T KNOW.

   - CHEYNE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
           - [sighs]
    - MY WIFE SAYS THAT I'M
   A LITTLE ON THE SLOW SIDE,
 SO I WOULD HAVE PICKED TURTLE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
   VANESSA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I WENT WITH JUST
     STUPID PAD AND PEN...
        - PAPER AND PEN.
  - BECAUSE YOU WRITE SO WELL,

     BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT
    TO PUT DOWN THE TURTLE.
   - HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.
 WHO DID YOUR WIFE SAY SHE HAS
  A BETTER RELATIONSHIP WITH--

  HER BOSS, HER EX-BOYFRIEND,
     OR HER MOTHER-IN-LAW?
             RICKY.
  - EX-BOYFRIEND, BECAUSE HE--

          - WHAT'S HER
      EX-BOYFRIEND'S NAME?
       - WHICH--UM, MIKE,
     OR SOMEONE ELSE, OR...
      SHE'S GOT A COUPLE.

          - YOU KNOW--
- NO, SHE HAS, LIKE, YOU KNOW--
    I'M ACTUALLY REALLY COOL
       WITH ALL OF THEM,
       AND SO IT'S LIKE--
    - OH, WITH ALL OF THEM.

          - YEAH, SO--
  - SO IT'S THE EX-BOYFRIEND.
  - I THINK THE EX-BOYFRIEND.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  DONNA MARIE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         - HALLELUJAH.

        - EX-BOYFRIEND.
          - THANK YOU!
    - ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
    MOVE ON TO YOU, CHEYNE.

   - UH, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
   HER MOTHER-IN-LAW, MY MOM.
         THEY GET ALONG
    PARTICULARLY WITH FOOD.
    AND BUTTER, JUST LIKE--
            - WHAT?

   - ALL, LIKE, FOOD THINGS,
         THEY'RE LIKE--
      - BUT THEY'RE CRAZY
     ABOUT MAYO AND BUTTER,
   AND THEY'VE BONDED OVER--
        OVER DAIRY AND--

- ALL RIGHT, THAT--THAT ACTUALLY
    SOUNDS REALLY BAD, BUT--
     - ALL RIGHT. VANESSA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        - MOTHER-IN-LAW.

      - WE'RE GETTIN' FAT
       TOGETHER, I GUESS.
       CLOGGED ARTERIES,
      BUTTER, MAYONNAISE--
- OKAY, WHAT ABOUT YOU, KHADIR?

    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
     MOTHER-IN-LAW AS WELL.
      UM, LIZ DOESN'T HAVE
       A BOSS RIGHT NOW,
      AND HER EX-BOYFRIEND
      OWES HER SOME MONEY,

        SO I'M GONNA GO
      WITH MOTHER-IN-LAW.
   - HE OWES YOU SOME MONEY?
       - AFTER THIS SHOW,
        I'M GONNA GO ON

ONE OF THOSE COURT SHOWS THAT--
   - AND JUST, LIKE, SUE HIM.
   I GOT A COUPLE COURT SHOWS
    I CAN RECOMMEND TO YOU.
   - AWESOME. THANKS, SHERRI.
    - OKAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

        - MOTHER-IN-LAW.
           - KISS ME.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHAT
  WE HAVE AS FAR AS OUR SCORE.

  KHADIR AND LIZ, YOU GUYS ARE
  IN THE LEAD WITH 35 POINTS.
      OKAY, STICK AROUND.
    OUR FINAL BONUS QUESTION
          IS COMING UP

AND IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS,
      SO ANYBODY CAN WIN.
         DON'T GO AWAY.
  IF YOU HAVE COPD LIKE I DO,

      YOU KNOW HOW HARD
      IT CAN BE TO BREATHE
   AND WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.
   COPD INCLUDES CHRONIC
   BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA.

     SPIRIVA HELPS CONTROL
     MY COPD SYMPTOMS
     BY KEEPING MY AIRWAYS
     OPEN A FULL 24 HOURS.
        PLUS, IT REDUCES
        COPD FLARE-UPS.

      SPIRIVA IS THE ONLY
      ONCE-DAILY INHALED
   COPD MAINTENANCE TREATMENT
   THAT DOES BOTH.
     AND IT'S STEROID-FREE.

    SPIRIVA DOES NOT REPLACE
    FAST-ACTING INHALERS
      FOR SUDDEN SYMPTOMS.
   TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF
   YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,

  GLAUCOMA, TROUBLE URINATING,
  OR AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.
 THESE MAY WORSEN WITH SPIRIVA.
   DISCUSS ALL MEDICINES
   YOU TAKE, EVEN EYE DROPS.

  STOP TAKING SPIRIVA AND
  SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL HELP
       IF YOUR BREATHING
       SUDDENLY WORSENS,
 YOUR THROAT OR TONGUE SWELLS,

     YOU GET HIVES, VISION
     CHANGES OR EYE PAIN,
   OR PROBLEMS PASSING URINE.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
  DRY MOUTH AND CONSTIPATION.

         NOTHING CAN
         REVERSE COPD.
        SPIRIVA HELPS ME
        BREATHE BETTER.
    DOES BREATHING WITH COPD
    WEIGH YOU DOWN?

      ASK YOUR DOCTOR
      IF SPIRIVA CAN HELP.
    WELCOME BACK. ALL RIGHT,
     HERE'S WHERE WE STAND.
  KHADIR AND LIZ, YOU GUYS ARE
  IN THE LEAD WITH 35 POINTS,

         BUT IT'S TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.
 THIS IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS,
     SO IT'S ANYONE'S GAME.
      ARE YOU GUYS READY?

             - YES.
         - HERE WE GO.
  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       IN LOVE, YOU GOTTA
       PICK YOUR BATTLES,

      SO I BITE MY TONGUE
    WHEN MY HUSBAND BLANKS,
   AND HE LOOKS THE OTHER WAY
         WHEN I BLANK.
             RICKY.

     - I LOOK THE OTHER WAY
  WHEN SHE DRINKS TOO MUCH...
          - ALL RIGHT.
- AND I--SHE BITES HER TONGUE--
         I DON'T KNOW.

 SHE BITES HER TONGUE WHEN I--
        - DON'T GIVE UP.
     - WHEN I DON'T CLEAN,
     OR WHEN I DON'T COOK,
    OR, NO, WHEN I DO COOK.

   - WE HAVE--WE HAVE TO TAKE
      WHEN YOU DON'T COOK.
            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.
    ALL RIGHT, DONNA MARIE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

          - NOT THAT.
           - OH, NO.
            - YOU--
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.

       - WHEN YOU DRIVE.
    - OH, YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
- BUT YOU LOOK THE OTHER WAY...
  - BUT YOU DID GET ONE RIGHT.
     - WHEN SHE GETS DRUNK.

      YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
      - I LOVE WATCHING--
         DON'T YOU LOVE
WATCHING RICKY AND DONNA MARIE,
       THE WHOLE DYNAMIC?

     ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA
       GO TO YOU, CHEYNE.
       - UH, I WOULD SAY
      SHE BITES HER TONGUE
     WHEN I PROBABLY LEAVE,
 UH, SOME DISHES IN THE SINK...

           - MM-HMM.
 - UM, AND I KIND OF LET IT GO
     WHEN SHE LEAVES SHOES
    ALL OVER THE APARTMENT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, VANESSA?

    - WELL, WE DID A HALFSIE
          ON THAT ONE
     - WHEN YOU'RE SLOW...
    - BECAUSE YOU ARE SLOW--
- BUT WHEN SHE LEAVES THE SHOES
     ALL OVER THE HOUSE...

             - YEP.
    - SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
    - I DON'T BITE MY TONGUE
   ABOUT THOSE DISHES, EVER.
- RIGHT NOW, CHEYNE AND VANESSA,

   YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD.
 KHADIR AND LIZ, YOU ONLY NEED
TO GET ONE OF THE ANSWERS RIGHT,
 SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, KHADIR?

         - I'M GONNA GO
   LEAVE THE TOILET SEAT UP.
            - OKAY.
 - AND PEE WITH THE DOOR OPEN.

       - ALL RIGHT, WHAT
       DID YOU SAY, LIZ?
      - YOU GOT ONE RIGHT.
    - ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT.
CONGRATULATIONS, KHADIR AND LIZ.

      YOU ARE THE WINNERS.
    YOU'RE GOING TO CURAçAO,
      AND A SPECIAL THANKS
   TO OUR RUNNER-UP COUPLES.

    THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
  <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i> GOOD NIGHT.
   - HI, I'M SHERRI SHEPHERD.

          DID YOU KNOW
     THAT 88% OF AMERICANS
   GET MARRIED AT LEAST ONCE
       IN THEIR LIFETIME?
  WHICH MEANS 88% OF AMERICANS
      HAVE USED THE PHRASE

        "I CAN'T BELIEVE
      I'M MARRIED TO YOU."
           [laughter]
- HERE ARE TONIGHT'S NEWLYWEDS.
   THEY GOT MATCHING TATTOOS
        ON THEIR WRISTS

         A MONTH AFTER
      THEY STARTED DATING.
     THEY DON'T HAVE A FEAR
   OF NEEDLES OR COMMITMENT.
      MEET MAT AND MEGAN.

      AT THEIR RECEPTION,
        OUR NEXT COUPLE
     TOOK THE CHICKEN DANCE
        VERY SERIOUSLY.
   HERE ARE VICTOR AND EMILY.

AND THEY BROKE UP FOR FIVE YEARS
WHILE HE SERVED IN THE MARINES.
        THEN HE FINISHED
    FIGHTING FOR HIS COUNTRY
     AND CAME HOME TO FIGHT
      OVER MAKING THE BED.

   WELCOME MADSIN AND KRISTA.

  HELLO, FELLAS, HOW ARE YOU?

   - OKAY, WELL, I AM SO GLAD
      THAT YOU'RE EXCITED,
       BECAUSE WE'VE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.

   WE WILL GET RIGHT INTO IT.
 GENTLEMEN, WHEN YOUR HEAD DIPS
      TO YOUR WIFE'S HIPS,

      WHERE DO YOU USUALLY
        FIND HER HANDS?
              MAT.
             - OOH.
       RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
          HUH, SHERRI?

      - RIGHT OFF THE BAT.
- WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND, UH,
    USUALLY, LIKE, RIGHT ON
   MY SHOULDERS, HOLDIN' ON.
        - OKAY. VICTOR.

        - I'M GONNA SAY
        ON MY SHOULDERS,
    'CAUSE SHE ALWAYS ENJOYS
          TO BE THERE.
        - OKAY. MADSIN.

     - I-I WOULD DEFINITELY
   HAVE TO SAY THE SHOULDERS,
      GRIPPIN' ON REALLY,
         REALLY TIGHT.
   - OKAY. IS IT A WILD RIDE?

         - DEFINITELY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
      SHE DOES IT SO OFTEN

   THAT MY WIFE MUST BE GOING
    FOR SOME SORT OF RECORD
    AS THE WOMAN WHO BLANKS
      THE MOST IN ONE DAY.
            VICTOR.

  - I'M GONNA SAY ENJOYING THE
RIDE THE MOST TIMES IN ONE DAY.
   - OKAY, ENJOYING THE RIDE
        THE MOST TIMES.
     - ENJOY THE RIDE, YES.

     - WELL, HOW MANY TIMES
         IS IT USUALLY?
      - WELL, MORE THAN--
        MORE THAN ONCE.
      - ALL RIGHT. MADSIN.

       - I GUESS KISSES.
       - OHH, OKAY. MAT.
      - I'M GONNA SAY, UH,
      MAKES HER MAN HAPPY.

          - ALL RIGHT.
     YEAH, GIVE IT TO HIM,
   GIVE IT TO HIM, ALL RIGHT.
    - THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
         NO, THANK YOU.

   - SO HOW DOES SHE DO THAT?
      - UH, VARIOUS WAYS,
      UH, DURING THE DAY,
   AND, OF COURSE, AT NIGHT.
            - OKAY.

     I MEAN, "VARIOUS WAYS"
    CAN MEAN SO MANY THINGS.
       CAN YOU ELABORATE?
            - UH...
      NOCTURNAL EXERCISE.

        CAN I SAY THAT?
         - NOCTURNAL--
- CAN I SAY THAT ON TELEVISION?
         IS THAT GOOD?
           [applause]
        - IS THAT--OKAY.

    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
       BE HONEST, FELLAS.
      WHAT'S THE ONE PART
    OF YOUR WEDDING CEREMONY

  THAT YOUR BRIDE INSISTED ON,
BUT YOU COULD HAVE DONE WITHOUT?
            MADSIN.
     - I WOULD PROBABLY SAY
MAYBE, THE, UH, GARTER TOSSING,

        I GUESS IT WAS.
     - THE GARTER TOSSING?
    - YEAH, IT WASN'T REALLY
      A BIG THING FOR ME.
          - OKAY. MAT.

       - UH, THERE REALLY
        WASN'T ANYTHING.
  WE PLANNED THE--THE CEREMONY
       KIND OF TOGETHER.
   - YOU PLANNED IT TOGETHER?
          - OH, YEAH.

        - OKAY. VICTOR.
     - I'M GOING TO SAY...
  I'M GONNA SAY THE LOCATION,
    SPECIFICALLY THE BEACH,

           BECAUSE--
 - SHE WANTED IT ON THE BEACH?
        - SHE WANTED IT
     ON THE BEACH SO BADLY.
   - OKAY. FELLAS, THANK YOU
       SO MUCH. NICE JOB.

       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,
BECAUSE THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST
 POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME
      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
 SECOND HONEYMOON TO ST. LUCIA!

        ARE YOU EXCITED?
             - YES.
       - OKAY, I AM GLAD.

   IS--YOU GUYS ALL EXCITED.
   WELL, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

  EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS WORTH
 5 POINTS. HERE WE GO, LADIES.
   ACCORDING TO YOUR HUSBAND,
       WHEN HIS HEAD DIPS
         TO YOUR HIPS,

     WHERE DOES HE USUALLY
        FIND YOUR HANDS?
             MEGAN.
       - UM, I WOULD SAY,
      UH, BEHIND HIS HEAD.

       - BEHIND HIS HEAD?
             - YES.
   - JUST KIND OF HOLDIN' ON
         FOR DEAR LIFE?
         - YEAH, YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.

    - MAT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   HE SAID ON HIS SHOULDERS.
          - OH, OKAY.
  - WHICH IS PART OF THE HEAD.

           - [laughs]
   - UH, IT'S WITH THE HEAD.
     NO, WE CAN'T TAKE IT.
           - [sighs]
       - SO SORRY, GUYS.
             EMILY.

- MY HANDS WOULD BE ON HIS HEAD.
THAT WOULD BE MY GUESS, AS WELL.
   - VICTOR, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       ON HIS SHOULDERS.
       - ON MY SHOULDERS.
       - OHH, SHOULDERS.

    - THEY'RE PART--VICTOR,
    PART OF THE HEAD, RIGHT?
  - PART OF THE HEAD, I AGREE.
          - THANK YOU.
   - OH, OKAY. WE ALREADY SEE
   MAT IS TROUBLE OVER HERE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
    KRISTA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - I WAS GONNA SAY
    ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.

   - MADSIN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       ON HIS SHOULDERS.
     IT--IT JUST SHOWS YOU,
  THEY'RE NOT PAYIN' ATTENTION
     TO <i>WHAT</i> YOU'RE DOIN'.

       - AT ALL, AT ALL.
       - THEY DON'T KNOW
       WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
         - I'M FOCUSED.
  - I DON'T EVEN THINK I COULD
PHYSICALLY REACH HIS SHOULDERS.

      - THAT'S WHAT I WAS
        THINKING MYSELF.
   YOU CAN'T--YOU CAN'T REACH
     THE SHOULDERS, FELLAS.
    THAT'S THE--SHE WOULD BE
      GRIPPING FOR DEAR...

        [groans] LIKE...
    BUT YOU'RE VERY FOCUSED.
         I DO GET THAT.
      YOU'RE VERY FOCUSED.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
      SHE DOES IT SO OFTEN

   THAT MY WIFE MUST BE GOING
    FOR SOME SORT OF RECORD
    AS THE WOMAN WHO BLANKS
      THE MOST IN ONE DAY.
             EMILY.

     - I'D SAY...COMPLAINS.
     I MEAN, IT'S NOT MY--
MY BEST TRAIT OR CHARACTERISTIC,
    BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
         WITH COMPLAIN.

    - WITH COMPLAINS, OKAY.
   VICTOR, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - ENJOYS THE RIDE.
       - ENJOY THE RIDE.
           [laughter]

 - WHAT RIDE ARE YOU ENJOYING--
       ENJOYING SO MUCH--
    - I-I GUESS I UNDERSTAND
 WHAT RIDE HE'S TALKING ABOUT,
          BUT I MEAN--
      - IT'S A GREAT RIDE.

      - I THINK COMPLAIN.
   I'M A--IT'S NOT VERY NI--
    IT'S NOT MY BEST TRAIT.
- OKAY. KRISTA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         - LAY AROUND.

            - OKAY.
           [laughter]
   - MADSIN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         - OH, I--OHH.
       - HE SAID KISSES.
           - YES. AW.

- YOU DO A LOT OF KISSIN', HUH?
 - NO, SHE'S ALWAYS KISSIN' ME.
        - I AM. I--IT'S
     A LITTLE OVERBEARING.
 I'M ALWAYS THE ONE WHO STARTS
 IT. I SHOULD HAVE REMEMBERED.

 I WAS TRYIN' TO BE NICE, MAN.
            - MEGAN.
    - I WOULD SAY...SMILES.
     - MAT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

      MAKES HER MAN HAPPY.
         - BY SMILING.
          - [laughing]
         - NO, NOTHING?

        DO WE HAVE ANY--
     - WE CAN'T... [laughs]
       - IT'S OKAY, MAT.

THIS IS--WE'RE NOT EVEN A THIRD
  OF THE WAY THROUGH THE GAME.
       YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
      - WE'RE HERE TO WIN.
       - YEAH, YOU KNOW.
      - I GET IT SOMEWHAT.

   - IT'S OKAY. LET IT ALL GO
       AND SLIDE THROUGH.
          - LET IT GO.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.

     WE ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
          TO BE HONEST
    AND TELL US THE ONE PART
    OF YOUR WEDDING CEREMONY
     THAT YOU INSISTED ON,

       BUT HE COULD HAVE
         DONE WITHOUT.
   WHAT DO YOU THINK HE SAID?
            KRISTA?
 - THE--THE, UH, MONTAGE VIDEOS
          THAT WE HAD.

        - OH. WHAT KIND
  OF MONTAGE VIDEOS WERE THEY?
  - I HAD, LIKE, THREE VIDEOS
         OF OUR LIVES.
     - YOU HAD THREE VIDEOS
        AT YOUR WEDDING?

     - IT WAS A PRODUCTION.
- YOU DID A WHOLE PRODUCTION...
            - YEAH.
        - MONTAGE VIDEOS
       OF YOU AND MADSIN?

         - YEAH, YEAH.
- OKAY. MADSIN, WHAT'D YOU S?
    HE SAID THE GARTER TOSS.
          - OHH, YEAH.
         - THAT WAS IT.

    - I DIDN'T REALLY INSIST
      ON THAT ONE, THOUGH.
          I--IN FACT,
      I FORGOT THE GARTER!
 I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE GARTER.

     WE HAD TO MAKE, LIKE,
      A MAKESHIFT NAPKIN.
- BUT YOU JUST FLUNG SOMEBODY'S
   SWEATY OLD NAPKIN, RIGHT?
  - YEP, IT WAS A GREAT TIME.

     - SOME DUDE CAUGHT IT.
           ALL RIGHT.
   AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, MEGAN?
       - UM, I WOULD SAY
       THE BOUQUET TOSS.

      - THE BOUQUET TOSS.
           ALL RIGHT.
      MAT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            NOTHING.
             - AW.

       - AW, SEE? AGAIN,
       A LITTLE BIT. AW.
           [applause]
         - AW. [laughs]
        - I'LL KEEP YOU.

      - ALL RIGHT, EMILY.
- HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DO
    WITHOUT THE WHOLE THING,
   BUT THAT'S NOT MY ANSWER.

   MY, UM, YOU SAID CEREMONY,
        SO I'M GONNA SAY
     WE DID A SAND CEREMONY
      DURING OUR CEREMONY.
 I DON'T THINK HE NEEDED THAT.

- A SAND CEREMONY. WHAT'S THAT?
      - YES. UH, WE HAD--
      WE WERE ON A BEACH,
      SO WE BOTH HAD SAND,
   AND WE COMBINED THE SANDS,

     YOU KNOW, UNITED SANDS
     INTO ONE SAND HEART...
           - OH. OHH.
       - OF SORTS, YEAH.
            - OKAY.
    VICTOR, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       HE SAID THE BEACH.
      - I SAID THE BEACH.
   - OHH, YOU COULD HAVE DONE
    WITHOUT THE WHOLE BEACH.
       - WHERE'D THE SAND
       COME FROM, VICTOR?

   - IT CAME FROM THE BEACH,
         THE SAND. AHH.
     - SAND'S ON THE BEACH.
      - I LOVE THIS GROUP!
  - LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.

   WE DON'T HAVE ANY POINTS,
NOT YET, BUT WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,
  AND THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED.
          STAY TUNED.

TURN TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.

     THESE NEXT 3 ARE WORTH
 10 POINTS EACH. ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.
    - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.
     YOUR HUSBAND MAY THINK

   HE'S A BRILLIANT CONDUCTOR
        IN THE BEDROOM,
 BUT IF YOU WERE FORCED TO MAKE
    ONE CHANGE TO HIS BATON,
      WHAT WOULD YOU DO--

          ELONGATE IT,
          THICKEN IT,
  OR TEACH IT SOME NEW MOVES?

             MEGAN.
          - [whistles]
I MAY TEACH IT A FEW NEW MOVES.
       - ANY PARTICULAR--
- ONLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT NEED
 TO BE ELONGATED OR THICKENED,

      SO THAT'S MY CHOICE.
     - OKAY, SO BY DEFAULT,
      IT'S THE NEW MOVES.
         - ABSOLUTELY.
         - OKAY. EMILY.

  - I'M ALSO GONNA HAVE TO SAY
    TEACH IT SOME NEW MOVES.
 I THINK THAT IT'S--IT'S A GOOD
     MAGICAL CONDUCTOR WAND
  OR HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SAY.

 BUT, YOU KNOW, EVERYONE COULD
     USE A COUPLE NEW WAND,
    UH, MAGIC TRICKS, RIGHT?
             OKAY.
    - ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT,

        - IT'S PERFECT.

       - HERE'S OUR NEXT
       QUESTION, LADIES.
  THERE IS NO PLACE LIKE HOME,
      BUT IF YOUR HUSBAND
     COULD CLICK HIS HEELS

 AND GO ONE PLACE BESIDES HOME,
       WHERE WOULD HE GO?
             EMILY.
    - IT'S FUN 'CAUSE, LIKE,
  I'LL ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS

  KNOWING HE'S NOT GONNA GUESS
     THE SAME THING AS ME,
      BUT I'M GONNA SAY--
    I'M GONNA STILL SAY IT,
      'CAUSE HE SAYS THIS
         ALL THE TIME--

  HE LOVES THE CAYMAN ISLANDS.
           - KRISTA.
   - UH, HE WOULD SAY VENICE.
           - VENICE.
            - YEAH.
        - VENICE, ITALY?

         - OKAY. MEGAN.

      IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
     THERE'S NOTHIN' WRONG
    WITH PIG PANTIES, GIRL.

   HOT SAUCE ON THEM PANTIES

           AND, GIRL,

     COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE

   USING THE CHOICES SHORTER,
     LONGER, OR THE SAME--
   COMPARED TO THE EARLY DAYS
       OF OUR COURTSHIP,
    I WOULD SAY PHONE CALLS
   WITH MY HUSBAND ARE BLANK,

         WHILE THE SEX
      IS DEFINITELY BLANK.
             MEGAN.
 - UM, PHONE CALLS ARE SHORTER,

 WHILE THE SEX IS DEFINITELY...
   I WOULD GO WITH THE SAME.
        - WITH THE SAME.
         - YEAH, YEAH.
         - OKAY. EMILY.

       - THE PHONE CALLS
     ARE FOR SURE SHORTER,
          ABSOLUTELY.
         THE SEX, UM...

    I'D SAY THE SAME, YEAH.
   I MEAN, IF I WAS TO TAKE--
      TAKE A STOPWATCH...
            - OKAY.
 - I'M GONNA GO WITH THE SAME.

 - DOES IT BUM YOU OUT AT ALL,
        EMILY, OR JUST--
- NO, I THINK THE SAME IS A GOOD
   AMOUNT OF TIME, YOU KNOW?
      IT'S A PERFECT TIME.
 THAT'S WHY IT STAYS THE SAME.

             RIGHT?
      - OH, GOSH. KRISTA.
       - UH, PHONE CALLS
      DEFINITELY SHORTER.

 UH, SEX, I WOULD SAY THE SAME.
     - YOU'D SAY THE SAME.
            - YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

 AND GO ONE PLACE BESIDES HOME,
    WHERE DID YOUR WIFE SAY
           YOU'D GO?

        THE FIRST FLAVOR
    SHE'D PUT ON THE MARKET?

     [cheers and applause]
          - CHOCOLATE.

          - GOOD JOB.
    - VICTOR, WHAT SAY YOU?

            - EMILY?

     - ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.
     [cheers and applause]

    MAT AND MEGAN, YOU GUYS
ARE IN THE LEAD WITH 30 POINTS.
         STICK AROUND.
    OUR FINAL BONUS QUESTION
         IS COMING UP,

AND IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
         DON'T GO AWAY.
     [cheers and applause]
 LOOK W WE GOT HERE.

  PUT A LITTLE PEPPER ON THAT.
       I'M A TYPICAL MOM.
    I GO TO AMUSEMENT PARKS.

      AND MY KID'S GAMES.
 AND JUST LIKE ANY TYPICAL MOM
 I'M THRILLED WHEN MY CHAMPION

     LOVES TO EAT SOMETHING
     NUTRITIOUS,
 LIKE CHOBANI CHAMPIONS YOGURT.
 IT'S A GOOD SOURCE OF PROTEIN,

AND MOST IMPORTANT, HE LOVES IT.
     SO EVEN THOUGH I'M AN
     OLYMPIAN, AROUND HERE,
 I'M JUST ANOTHER MOM TRYING TO
 HELP HER CHAMPION WIN THE DAY.

       CHOBANI CHAMPIONS.
       WIN THE DAY.
     So what I'm saying is,
      people like options.
      When you take GEICO,

 you can call them anytime you
    feel like saving money.
        It don't matter,
         day or night.
       Use your computer,
        your smartphone,
     your tablet, whatever.

         The point is,
       you have options.
      Oh, how convenient.
        Hey. Crab cakes,
    what are you looking at?

  GEICO. Fifteen minutes could
  save you fifteen percent or
     more on car insurance.
         EAT GOOD FATS.
           AVOID BAD.

     DON'T GO OVER 2000...
      1200 CALORIES A DAY.
 CARBS ARE BAD. CARBS ARE GOOD.

   THE STORY KEEPS CHANGING.
    SO I'M NOT LISTENING...
     TO ANYONE BUT MYSELF.

    I KNOW BETTER NUTRITION
    WHEN I SEE IT:
         GREAT GRAINS.
   GREAT GRAINS CEREAL STARTS
   WHOLE AND STAYS WHOLE.

         SEE THE SEAM?
  MORE PROCESSED FLAKES LOOK
  NOTHING LIKE NATURAL GRAINS.
     YOU CAN'T ARGUE WITH
     NUTRITION YOU CAN SEE.

         GREAT GRAINS.
     SEARCH GREAT GRAINS
     AND SEE FOR YOURSELF.
 FOR MULTI GRAIN FLAKES THAT ARE
 AN EXCELLENT SOURCE OF FIBER

       TRY GREAT GRAINS
       BANANA NUT CRUNCH
  AND CRANBERRY ALMOND CRUNCH.

  PERFECT FOR THOSE IMPROMPTU
 ROMANTIC MOMENTS ON THE BEACH.
  THAT'S OUR SHOW, EVERYBODY.

     THANK YOU FOR WATCHING
  <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i> GOOD NIGHT!
          DID YOU KNOW
     THAT IN PENNSYLVANIA,
      IT'S AGAINST THE LAW
      FOR A BRIDE OR GROOM

         TO GET MARRIED
      WHILE THEY'RE DRUNK?
       I GUESS THAT'S WHY
      THEY INVENTED VEGAS.
 HERE ARE TONIGHT'S NEWLYWEDS.

      ON THEIR FIRST DATE,
    THEY WENT TO BREAKFAST.
       I GUESS SHE LIKED
  HOW HE HANDLED HIS SAUSAGE.
      MEET MATT AND HEIDI.

       AT THEIR WEDDING,
   HER FATHER SURPRISED THEM
  WITH A BIG JUG OF MOONSHINE.
 NOW THAT'S SOMETHING YOU WON'T
    FIND ON MOST REGISTRIES.

   HERE ARE ANDREW AND TARA.
      AND HIS WIFE IS TINY
        BUT EATS A LOT,
 SO HE CALLS HER "SKINNY PIG."

    ATTENTION, MALE VIEWERS,
    DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.
 WELCOME JERMAINE AND JENNIFER.
 LET'S PLAY <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>

         [upbeat music]
  Captioning provided by GSN.
            - HELLO!

         HI, EVERYBODY.
       HELLO, AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
  FELLAS, HOW ARE YOU TONIGHT?
         - GOOD. GOOD.

        - ARE YOU READY?
   - I CAN'T WAIT. LET'S GO.
- OKAY. WELL, WE SENT YOUR WIVES
  BACKSTAGE SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
 WE'RE GONNA GET RIGHT INTO IT.

           GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS OUR FIRST QUESTION.
  IF YOU AND YOUR WIFE PLAYED
    SEVEN MINUTES IN HEAVEN
AT YOUR NORMAL LOVEMAKING PACE,

 BY THE TIME THE CLOCK RAN OUT,
    WOULD YOU BE WARMING UP,
      IN THE ACT, OR DONE?

             MATT.
             - WOW.
       UM, I'M GONNA SAY,

   UM, HOW ABOUT WARMING UP?
      - ALL RIGHT. ANDREW.
   - I WOULD ALSO HAVE TO SAY
          WARMING UP.

         - WARMING UP.
            - YEAH.
          - JERMAINE.
  - I'M GONNA SAY IN THE ACT.
  - NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN,
           ALL RIGHT.

       SURE, YOUR WIFE'S
        A GOOD GIRL NOW,
 BUT WHAT'S ONE BAD-GIRL HABIT
 SHE KICKED BEFORE SHE MET YOU?
            ANDREW.

   - SHE DOESN'T REALLY HAVE
      A LOT OF BAD HABITS,
      AND I THINK THE ONES
  THAT SHE HAS, SHE STILL HAS.
       UM [laughs] UH...
   - SO SHE DIDN'T KICK ANY.

            - YEAH.
EATING BAD FOOD, I WOULD--YEAH.
       - OKAY. JERMAINE.
         - WHEN MY WIFE
      USED TO GO TO BARS,

        SHE WOULD--SHE--
 LET'S SAY SHE WENT TO THE BAR
          WITH $20...
            - OKAY.
- SHE WOULD COME HOME WITH $20.

             - OH.
     - SHE WOULD MAKE GUYS
   BUY HER DRINKS ALL NIGHT.
   SHE WAS VERY GOOD AT THAT.

 - THAT DON'T SOUND LIKE A BAD
 HABIT TO ME, LADIES, DOES IT?
BUT FOR YOU, IT'S LIKE, UNH-UNH.
    FOR GUYS, IT'S NOT GOOD.
            - RIGHT.
         - OKAY. MATT.

  - WELL, MY WIFE IS SMOKIN',
 BUT I THINK ONE OF THE HABITS
   SHE DOES NOT HAVE ANYMORE,
       SHE DOESN'T SMOKE,
 SO I'M GONNA GO WITH SMOKING.

           - [laughs]
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
       COMPLETE THIS POST
    TO YOUR TWITTER ACCOUNT.

   I'M AT <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME </i>
  <i>JUST WAITING FOR THE MOMENT</i>
  WHEN MY WIFE MAKES FUN OF ME
           FOR BLANK
    ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.
           JERMAINE.

- SHE--SHE'S GONNA SAY SOMETHING
            ABOUT ME
    LEAVING CLOTHES ALL OVER
   THE FLOOR IN OUR BEDROOM.
    - SO WOULD THAT JUST BE
       JUST HORRIFYING...

       - WELL, I MEAN...
    - IF SHE WOULD SAY THAT?
     - I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
    TO KNOW HOW MESSY I AM.
  - OH, BOY, NOW WE ALL KNOW.
            - YEAH.

       - ALL RIGHT. MATT.
- I FORGET EVERYTHING WITH HER,
 AND SHE'D SAY THE FIRST THING
 THAT'S GONNA GO IS MY MEMORY,
        SO SHE WOULD SAY
   I WOULD FORGET EVERYTHING.

- OKAY. ANDREW, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - WEARING A JUMPSUIT.
      - OKAY. SO WHAT IS--
     WHAT IS THE JUMPSUIT?
   ARE YOU MAKING VIDEOS WITH
  THE JUMPSUIT? WHAT ARE YOU--

    - NO, IT'S JUST TO WEAR
       AROUND THE HOUSE.
 IT'S, UH, I-I DON'T KNOW WHY.
      I THINK IT WAS, UM,
      FROM WATCHING <i>LOST.</i>

 IN--IN SOME OF THE FLASHBACKS,
 THEY ALL HAD THESE JUMPSUITS.
     AND I SAID, "I'D LIKE
      TO HAVE A JUMPSUIT,"
      SO SHE BOUGHT ME ONE
FOR A BIRTHDAY PRESENT ONE TIME.

            - YEAH?
      - AND NOW I WEAR IT
    AROUND THE HOUSE, BUT...
- ALL RIGHT, FELLAS, THANK YOU.
           NICE JOB.

       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
    CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS,
BECAUSE THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST
 POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME
  WILL WIN A FANTASTIC SECOND
   HONEYMOON TO THE BAHAMAS.

         CHECK IT OUT.
  BASK IN THE WARM HOSPITALITY
         OF THE BAHAMAS
      AT THE ALL-INCLUSIVE
PARADISE ISLAND HARBOUR RESORT.

      ENJOY CASUAL DINING,
          LIVELY BARS,
      AND DAILY ACTIVITIES
 WHILE RELAXING ON THE RESORT'S
      PRIVATE LAGOON BEACH

              FROM
PARADISE ISLAND HARBOUR RESORT.
OKAY, THE WIVES HAVE JOINED US.
        WELCOME, LADIES.

        WERE YOU FEELING
  A LITTLE BIT OF TREPIDATION
   KIND OF SITTING BACK THERE
          NOT KNOWING?
        - A LITTLE BIT.

   - A LITTLE BIT? ALL RIGHT,
   WELL, WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

  EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS WORTH
    5 POINTS, SO HERE WE GO.
LADIES, IF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
 PLAYED SEVEN MINUTES IN HEAVEN
AT YOUR NORMAL LOVEMAKING PACE,

 BY THE TIME THE CLOCK RAN OUT,
    DID HE SAY YOU WOULD BE
    WARMING UP, IN THE ACT,
            OR DONE?
             HEIDI.

             - HMM.
   KNOWING MATT, I WOULD SAY
     WE WERE PROBABLY DONE.
    - YOU'RE PROBABLY DONE.

    SEVEN MINUTES IN HEAVEN
       AND YOU'D BE DONE.
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, MATT?
          WARMING UP.
            [laughs]

   WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, TARA?
   - I WOULD SAY IN THE ACT?
      - ALL RIGHT, ANDREW.
          WARMING UP.

           - [laughs]
  - THAT--THAT--YOU--THAT'S--
       IS THAT LAUGHABLE?
 - I DON'T LIKE THE WARMING UP
           THAT MUCH.

- YOU DON'T LIKE THE WARMING UP
           THAT MUCH?
- I LIKE TO GET INTO IT. I DON'T
   LIKE IT TO TAKE THAT LONG.
 - OKAY. ALL RIGHT, NO PRESSURE
      ON YOU, ANDREW, HUH?

   - YEAH, NOT TOO MUCH, NO.
  - JENNIFER, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
            - DONE.
            - DONE?
            - YEAH.

          - ALL RIGHT.
  JERMAINE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          IN THE ACT.
         - IN THE ACT.
         - IT'S AMAZING

 WHAT THE WIVES THINK AND WHAT
 THE HUSBANDS THINK ABOUT THIS.
         - I'D BE DONE.
          - I LOVE IT.
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION,

 SURE, YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL NOW,
 BUT WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
   IS THE ONE BAD-GIRL HABIT
 YOU KICKED BEFORE YOU MET HIM?

             TARA.
  - MAKING OUT WITH STRANGERS.
           [laughter]

- THAT WILL GET YOU EVERY TIME,
             GIRL.
            - YEAH.
  - WELL, ONCE I FOUND ONE GUY
       TO MAKE OUT WITH,

      I STOPPED MAKING OUT
       WITH OTHER PEOPLE.
           - [laughs]
  ANDREW, NO PRESSURE ON YOU.

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        EATING BAD FOOD.
             - OH.
            - YEAH.
    - YEAH, HE LIKES TO BUY

    SORT OF ORGANIC-Y FOOD,
          FRESH FOOD.
      I'M FROM THE SOUTH.
     WE LIKE TO FRY IT UP.
            - YEAH.

           [cheering]
          - ALL RIGHT.
   JENNIFER, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

- I GAVE UP RIDING MOTORCYCLES.
   JERMAINE DOESN'T LIKE IT.
 - DID YOU HAVE YOUR OWN BIKE?
            - I DID.

       - WHERE IS IT AT?
        - I CRASHED IT.
- OH! I WONDER WHY HE WANTED YOU
      TO GIVE THAT ONE UP.
             - YEP.
            - YEAH.

 - WHAT DID YOU SAY, JERMAINE?
 MAKE THE GUYS BUY YOU DRINKS.
          - OH, YEAH.
     HE STOPPED THAT, TOO.

      - ALL RIGHT, HEIDI.
   - MAYBE FLAUNTING MY STUFF
          AT THE GYM.
     - ALL RIGHT, FLAUNTING
     YOUR STUFF AT THE GYM.

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
            SMOKING.
             - OH.
         - I WAS HOPING
SHE'D BE SMOKING SOMETHING ELSE,
        NOT CIGARETTES.

   - WHO ARE YOU MARRIED TO?
          - ALL RIGHT.
 SO THIS IS THE FINAL QUESTION,
            LADIES.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
       COMPLETE THIS POST
    TO HIS TWITTER ACCOUNT?
   I'M AT <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME </i>
  <i>JUST WAITING FOR THE MOMENT</i>

  WHEN MY WIFE MAKES FUN OF ME
           FOR BLANK
    ON NATIONAL TELEVISION.
           JENNIFER.
       - THE Y I DANCE.

 - WHAT DID YOU SAY, JERMAINE?
      LEAVING THE CLOTHES
         ON THE FLOOR.
             - OH.

   - IT WAS MAKING FUN OF ME.
            - YEAH.
             I WAS.

 - HOW DO YOU DANCE, JERMAINE?
       - HE GOES ALL OUT.
         - I'M KIND OF
     AN OLD-SCHOOL DANCER.
   I HAVE, LIKE, A, YOU KNOW,
         A LITTLE, UH,

  KICK-STEP, RUNNING MAN-TYPE
       DANCING, YOU KNOW.
       SO I THINK THAT'S
    WHAT SHE'S REFERRING TO.
       - I AM A LITTLE--
            - OKAY.

       COULD YOU SHOW US
  YOUR KICK-STEP RUNNING MAN?
          - HE SHOULD.
           [cheering]
       - WELL, YOU KNOW,
     I COULD DO A LITTLE...

       - OH, KID 'N PLAY.
           ALL RIGHT.
         - SO I THINK--
         I THINK THAT'S
    WHAT SHE'S REFERRING TO.

            - IT IS.
       - OKAY. THANK YOU.
       ALL RIGHT, HEIDI,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - HE IS THE MOST FORGETFUL
          PERSON EVER,

      SO HIS FORGETFULNESS
      I WOULD MAKE FUN OF.
            - OKAY.
    MATT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     HE FORGETS EVERYTHING.

     TARA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - UM, I WOULD SAY
       BEING INDECISIVE.
          - ALL RIGHT,
     AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?

  - I SAID WEARING A JUMPSUIT.
   - HIM WEARING A JUMPSUIT.
    - HE HAS THIS JUMPSUIT.
 - TELL ME ABOUT THIS JUMPSUIT.
 - IT'S A POWDER BLUE JUMPSUIT,

            AND I...
      I BOUGHT IT FOR HIM.
'CAUSE HE SAID ONE DAY, "I WOULD
 REALLY LIKE TO HAVE A JUMPSUIT
JUST TO WEAR AROUND THE HOUSE,"
        AND SO HE DOES.

AND HE WEARS, LIKE, A WIFEBEATER
     TANK TOP UNDERNEATH IT
  AND LEAVES IT ALL UNBUTTONED
         DOWN TO HERE,
     AND HE, LIKE, GOES OUT
    AND GRILLS ON THE PATIO

       AND SPENDS THE DAY
        IN HIS JUMPSUIT.
   - CAN WE GET A HALF POINT
      FOR THAT? I MEAN...
   - LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND
        WITH OUR SCORES.

    MATT AND HEIDI, YOU GUYS
 ARE IN THE LEAD WITH 5 POINTS.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,
  AND THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED,

         SO STAY TUNED.
          Hey, Becky.

   GUYS, I'VE FIGURED IT OUT!
   "THE LAW OF PIZZAPLICITY!"

                  GO ON...?
 YOU CAN GET TWO DIGIORNO PIZZAS
 FOR THE PRICE OF ONE DELIVERY!

              I THINK YOU JUST
               DOUBLED MY IQ.
  <i>[ Male Announcer ] YOU CAN GET</i>
       <i>TWO DIGIORNO PIZZAS</i>
  <i>FOR THE PRICE OF ONE DELIVERY.</i>

        <i>IT'S NOT DELIVERY,</i>

        GREW UP TOGETHER.
       YES, SINCE THIRD GRADE...

 ALL RIGHT, LADIES, IT IS YOUR
TURN TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.
          THESE NEXT 3
   ARE WORTH 10 POINTS EACH.
         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.

            - OKAY.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
       SOMETIMES I THINK
       I MARRIED A MULE,
    BECAUSE MY HUSBAND IS SO
STUBBORN WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.

             HEIDI.
- I CONSTANTLY HAVE TO TELL HIM
    TO TURN OFF THE LIGHTS,
    AND HE JUST WON'T DO IT.

     EVERY DAY I COME HOME,
EVERY LIGHT IN THE HOUSE IS ON.
- AND THEN YOU GO BACK THROUGH,
          CUT 'EM OFF,
  AND HE CUTS 'EM RIGHT BACK?
    - NO, I TAKE HIM TO THEM

    AND SAY, "TURN IT OFF."
  - WELL, IS THAT ONE WORKING,
             MOMMY?
             - NO.
       - NO, NOT WORKING.

- OH, BUT HE LIKES THE SPANKING.
  - OH, HE LIKES THE SPANKING.
  MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE DOES IT,
              HUH?
  ALL RIGHT, THAT'S A GOOD WAY
    TO GET A SPANKING. TARA.

   - HE'S NOT VERY STUBBORN,
  BUT I GUESS THAT ONE THING--
   HE ALWAYS--WHEN HE SLEEPS,
   HE ALWAYS WEARS EARPLUGS.
            - OKAY.
- AND IT MAKES ME KIND OF CRAZY,

   'CAUSE I ALWAYS FEEL LIKE,
      WHAT IF I NEED YOU?
   WHAT IF SOMETHING HAPPENS
        AND I NEED YOU,
     AND YOU CAN'T HEAR ME?

BUT HE ALWAYS PUTS IN EARPLUGS.
   - HE PUTS IN THE EARPLUGS.
            - YEAH.
     - OKAY. AND JENNIFER.
    - I WOULD SAY CLEANING.
          HE'S A SLOB.

         AND I TELL HIM
   WE'RE HAVING PEOPLE OVER,
     YOU HAVE TO CLEAN UP,
        AND HE DOESN'T,
     SO I END UP DOING IT,
     AND I THINK THAT'S WHY

       HE DOESN'T DO IT,
    'CAUSE HE KNOWS I WILL.
- BECAUSE HE KNOWS YOU'LL DO IT.
     - HE JUST WON'T DO IT.
           - LADIES,
   HERE'S OUR NEXT QUESTION.

  WHEN YOUR HUSBAND PERSPIRES
          DURING SEX,
        DO YOU FEEL LIKE
  YOU'RE CAUGHT IN A MONSOON,
    STUCK IN A MILD SHOWER,

      OR UNDER A SLOW LEAK
        IN THE CEILING?
             TARA.
      - UM, I'M GONNA SAY
   SLOW LEAK IN THE CEILING.

    HE DOESN'T SWEAT A LOT.
           YOU KNOW,
  HE DOESN'T PERSPIRE A LOT...
            - YEAH.

      - WHICH DOESN'T MEAN
    HE DOESN'T GET INTO IT.
          - JENNIFER.
     - I'D SAY A SLOW LEAK.
      HE DOESN'T PERSPIRE.

            - OKAY.
        - HE'S WORKING,
    BUT HE DOESN'T PERSPIRE.
   - BUT JUST NOT PERSPIRING.
             HEIDI.
     - MATT'S THE SAME WAY,

   SO I WOULD SAY SLOW LEAK.
      - A SLOW LEAK, OKAY.
   THIS IS OUR NEXT QUESTION.
 OF ALL THE THINGS YOUR HUSBAND
          HUNGERS FOR,

     HIS APPETITE FOR WHAT
    CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED.
           JENNIFER.
        UM, HIS APPETITE

     FOR ME GOING "SOUTH."
             - OH.
    CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED.

      - NO, NEVER ENOUGH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             HEIDI.
     - THE MAN IS A FOODIE,

SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO THAT WAY
 AND SAY KRYSTAL'S HAMBURGERS.
          KRYSTAL'S--
    OH, BUT THOSE ARE GOOD.
 - YEAH, AND I'M A VEGETARIAN,
        SO I DON'T CARE.

             - OH.
        - BUT, YOU KNOW,
       I MIGHT EAT MEAT.
    I JUST DON'T DIGEST IT.
          - OH, OKAY.

        I LOVE THAT ONE.
      WRITE THAT ONE DOWN.
            THAT'S--
     THAT'S ONE YOU PUT ON
        FOR A RINGTONE.

            LOVE IT.
             TARA.
 - UM, HE LOVES--HE LOVES, UM,

   LIKE, GAME, LIKE, A, LIKE,
    I DON'T KNOW, LIKE, LAMB
     AND THAT KIND OF FOOD,
      HE LOVES, LIKE, LAMB
   AND FANCY FOOD LIKE THAT,

     SO I'M GONNA SAY THAT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
        SO, LIKE, LAMB.
  - WE'RE NOT GONNA SAY THAT.
     THAT WAS REALLY GOOD.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
   HERE IS A BONUS QUESTION.
        IT HAS 2 PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

     BETWEEN THE TWO OF US,
     THE ONE WITH THE MOST
      BOOK SMARTS IS BLANK
   AND THE ONE WITH THE MOST
     COMMON SENSE IS BLANK.

             HEIDI.
- WE BOTH HAVE MASTER'S DEGREES,
    SO THAT'S GONNA BE HARD,
 BUT I THINK I'LL GO WITH MATT.
          - ALL RIGHT.

        - COMMON SENSE--
         ABSOLUTELY ME.
       - ALL RIGHT. TARA.

  - OH, ANDREW DEFINITELY HAS
 BETTER BOOK SMARTS THAN I DO.
  HE IS REALLY, REALLY SMART.
 AND I THINK DEFINITELY COMMON
   SENSE IS GONNA BE ME ALSO.

  - JENNIFER, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - BOOK SMART IS DEFINITELY ME.
            - OKAY.
     - AND HE'S JUST BETTER
   AT THE COMMON SENSE STUFF.

        - OKAY. LADIES,
    THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
 WE'RE GONNA SEE JUST HOW WELL
         THEIR HUSBANDS
