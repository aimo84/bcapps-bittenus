    TO SEE IF THEY CAN MATCH

 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE,
     BUT BEFORE WE DO THAT,
   LET'S CHECK ON THE SCORE.
    MATT AND HEIDI, YOU GUYS
 ARE IN THE LEAD WITH 5 POINTS.

    FELLAS, HERE'S THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       SOMETIMES I THINK
       I MARRIED A MULE,

       BECAUSE MY HUSBAND
         IS SO STUBBORN
    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
             MATT.
  - MM, HOW ABOUT I'M STUBBORN

  ABOUT LEAVING THE LIGHTS ON,
     BECAUSE I JUST DON'T--
   KEEP TURNING 'EM BACK ON.
 - ARE YOU AFRAID OF THE DARK,
             MATT?

           - [sighs]
     I LIKE TO SEE THINGS.
           - [laughs]
         HEIDI, DOES HE
      LIKE TO SEE THINGS?

   - HE LIKES TO SEE THINGS.
          - 'CAUSE YOU
     TURN ON THOSE LIGHTS.
            - WHOO.

      - ALL RIGHT, ANDREW.
   - UM, I WOULD SAY TALKING.
           - TALKING?
     - UH, YEAH. SOMETIMES
   SHE'LL SAY, "TALK TO ME,"

AND THAT JUST MAKES ME FREEZE UP
     IF THERE'S THAT MUCH--
       IF IT'S A DEMAND.
- THAT'S WAY TOO MUCH PRESSURE.
            - YEAH.

            - OKAY.
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, TARA?
 - I SAID, UM, WEARING EARPLUGS
    AT NIGHT WHEN I'M LIKE,

   WHAT IS SOMETHING HAPPENS
             TO ME
  AND I NEED YOU IN MY SLEEP?
            all: AW.

- WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, JERMAINE?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
          I'M STUBBORN
         WHEN IT COMES
      TO DOING YARD WORK.

           - REALLY?
       - CAN'T STAND IT.
 - JENNIFER, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - CLEANING.

     OH, WE CAN'T TAKE IT.
         I'M SO SORRY.
     - I END UP DOING BOTH.
     - JERMAINE, YOU GOTTA
   STOP DOING THE RUNNING MAN

 AND HELP OUT AROUND THE HOUSE.
  I MEAN, I KNOW YOU PUT A LOT
     OF ATTENTION AND TIME
    INTO THE DANCES, BUT YOU
   GOTTA HELP YOUR WIFE OUT.

     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
   THIS IS OUR NEXT QUESTION.
 WHEN YOU PERSPIRE DURING SEX,
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY
         SHE FEELS LIKE

   SHE'S CAUGHT IN A MONSOON,
       STUCK IN A SHOWER,
      OR UNDER A SLOW LEAK
        IN THE CEILING?

            ANDREW.
    - I WOULD SAY SLOW LEAK
        IN THE CEILING.
     I'M NOT A BIG SWEATER.

       - ALL RIGHT, TARA,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I SAID SLOW LEAK
        IN THE CEILING.
       - SLOW LEAK, YEAH.
            - YEAH!

        - AND, JERMAINE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I WOULD SAY SLOW LEAK.
    - A SLOW LEAK. JENNIFER?
         - WE GOT ONE.
          - SLOW LEAK.

         AND YOU, MATT.
        - I'M GONNA HAVE
    TO KEEP THE TRAIN GOING.
   I THINK IT'S A SLOW LEAK.
         - A SLOW LEAK.

       OF ALL THE THINGS
        YOU HUNGER FOR,
     YOUR APPETITE FOR WHAT
    CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED?

           JERMAINE.
        - I LIKE TO PLAY
     A LOT OF VIDEO GAMES.
             - MM.

  - SO I WOULD SAY MY APPETITE
FOR Xbox OR PLAYING VIDEO GAMES.
     - ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     SHE SAID YOUR APPETITE
     FOR HER GOING "SOUTH"

    CAN NEVER BE SATISFIED.
  - WELL, THAT'S A GOOD POINT.
          - I'M RIGHT.

   - YEAH, WE'LL HAVE TO SAY
  THAT SHE'S RIGHT ABOUT THAT.
            - OKAY.
           ALL RIGHT.
     MATT, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - I GOT THIS LITTLE THING

  - YEAH, DOWN SOUTH, WE HAVE
KRYSTALS DOWN THERE, NOT WHITE--

  - YEAH, THEY DON'T HAVE 'EM
     OUT HERE IN NEW YORK.
       YOU'RE MISSING OUT
     ON SOME GOOD KRYSTALS.
    HEIDI, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - HE DIGESTS THAT MEAT.

    - KRYSTAL'S HAMBURGERS!
      - ALL RIGHT, ANDREW.
      - UH, WELL, MY MIND
       ALSO WENT TO FOOD,

    UH, SO I WOULD SAY LAMB,
      WHICH IS MY FAVORITE
         KIND OF FOOD.
       - LAMB. ALL RIGHT.

            - DINA.

 I WORE TO MY SISTER'S WEDDING.

     - WHAT IS THIS DRESS?
       - IT'S LIKE BLACK.
IT HAS, LIKE, CUTE SHOULDER PADS
  AND VERY LIKE 1940s STARLET.
           IT'S HOT.

          - ALL RIGHT.
        - I DON'T KNOW.
 - JOSH, TELL US WHAT YOU SAID.
    both: VA-VA-VOOM DRESS.
            - YEAH.

    [laughter and applause]
             - YES.
           ALL RIGHT.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.

WHO DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY IS MORE
  LIKELY TO TWEET WITH AN EX?
      YOU, HIM, OR BOTH OF
        YOU HAVE TWEETED
   OUTSIDE OF YOUR MARRIAGE.

           DANIELLE.
             - HIM.
- HE MUST BE THE ONE WHO TWEETS?
             - YEP.

   - DAMIEN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
             - ME.
         YOU'RE RIGHT.
           - FINALLY!

             DINA.
       - UH, TOTALLY ME.
         LIKE TOTALLY.
          UM, BECAUSE
   I'M THE ONE WITH EXs, SO.

       - AND SO YOU'D BE
    TWEETING WITH YOUR EXs?
    - OH, I'M SORRY, HONEY.
       - OKAY, WELL JOSH,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

 - BUT I WOULDN'T, I WOULDN'T.
     - YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.
         - HE SAID YOU.
      - I'M SORRY, HONEY.
        - BUT I THINK--

I THINK THERE WAS A LOOK ON HIS
     FACE WHEN YOU'RE LIKE
   I'M THE ONE WITH THE EXs.
 - HIS MOM WILL BE HAPPY ABOUT
      THAT, BUT WHATEVER.

          I LOVE YOU.
  - DO YOU TWEET WITH THE EXs?
          - NO, NEVER.
         HE'S THE BEST.

         audience: AH!
   - ANJALAY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- WELL, I DON'T THINK EITHER OF
   US REALLY DO IT THAT MUCH.

 SO, I GUESS IF IT'S EVEN, I'D
       HAVE TO SAY BOTH.
- OKAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY, BRENDAN?
     - YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
        WHAT TWITTER IS.

        - YOU'RE RIGHT.
      YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
         THAT DOES IT.
            - YEAH.
     - RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.

       - I LOVE, ANJALAY.
   SHE'S LIKE, YOU'RE RIGHT.
   I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT IS.
           [laughter]

    - OH, THIS IS OUR FINAL
        QUESTION, WIVES.
 HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND COMPLETE
         THIS SENTENCE?
  I KNOW EVERYBODY'S GOT THEIR
         FUNNY NOISES.

BUT NO ONE ON EARTH SOUNDS LIKE
    MY WIFE WHEN SHE BLANKS.
             DINA.
  - UM, I'D HAVE TO SAY FART.
           [laughter]

    - I'M LIKE THE GASSIEST
         PERSON AROUND.
    - NOT IN THE VA-VA-VOOM
         DRESS, IS IT?
    - WELL, THAT'S WHY IT'S
          VA-VA-VOOM.

           [laughter]
    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, JOSH?
        - WHEN YOU FART.

          - I LOVE IT.
   THE MEETING OF THE MINDS.
          THERE WE GO.
    ANJALAY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - I WOULD HAVE TO
       SAY WHEN I SLEEP.
 - WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SLEEP?
   - 'CAUSE I TEND TO SNORE.
- YEAH, WHAT'D YOU SAY BRENDAN?

           - SLEEPS.
        - SLEEPS, YEAH.
         THERE YOU GO.
           DANIELLE.

      - I WOULD SAY FART.
   IT SOUNDS LIKE A TRUMPET.
       DEFINITELY FARTS.
           [laughter]

       - AND HE'D BETTER
        PUT FARTS DOWN.
   - DAMIEN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        - WHEN YOU CRY.
            - WHAT?

       - I LIKED HIS CRY.
         HE HAD THIS--
    IT WAS THIS GREAT CRY--
           - [crying]
       - HOW'D YOU DO HER
         DOING HER CRY?

           [laughter]
             - SEE?
   IT'S DEFINITELY YOUR CRY.
   - I CAN'T FART RIGHT NOW--
         - OH, STOP IT!

   - BUT IF I FARTED IT WOULD
       BE LIKE A TRUMPET.
          - IT'S OKAY.
     WE ARE SO ON YOUR SIDE
   AND BELIEVE YOU, DANIELLE.

  IF YOU HAVE COPD LIKE I DO,

      YOU KNOW HOW HARD
      IT CAN BE TO BREATHE
   AND WHAT THAT FEELS LIKE.
   COPD INCLUDES CHRONIC
   BRONCHITIS AND EMPHYSEMA.

     MY COPD SYMPTOMS
     BY KEEPING MY AIRWAYS
     OPEN A FULL 24 HOURS.

   THAT DOES BOTH.
     AND IT'S STEROID-FREE.

    SPIRIVA DOES NOT REPLACE

   TELL YOUR DOCTOR IF
   YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,

  GLAUCOMA, TROUBLE URINATING,
  OR AN ENLARGED PROSTATE.
 THESE MAY WORSEN WITH SPIRIVA.
   DISCUSS ALL MEDICINES
   YOU TAKE, EVEN EYE DROPS.

 YOUR THROAT OR TONGUE SWELLS,

     YOU GET HIVES, VISION

  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
  DRY MOUTH AND CONSTIPATION.

         NOTHING CAN
         REVERSE COPD.
        SPIRIVA HELPS ME
        BREATHE BETTER.
    DOES BREATHING WITH COPD
    WEIGH YOU DOWN?

      ASK YOUR DOCTOR
      IF SPIRIVA CAN HELP.
       - WELCOME BACK TO
        <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
   IT IS YOUR TURN TO ANSWER

        A FEW QUESTIONS.
   THESE NEXT THREE ARE WORTH
        TEN POINTS EACH.
      HERE WE GO, LADIES.

  - IF YOU'RE HUSBAND'S LITTLE
    PERFORMER WERE STARRING
  IN A HARDBOILED CRIME DRAMA,
        WOULD IT BE CAST
      AS THE CROOKED COP,

 THE STRAIGHT-LACED DETECTIVE,
    OR THE HOODED CRIMINAL?
           [laughter]

           - ANJALAY.
  - I GUESS I WOULD HAVE TO GO
 WITH THE THIRD ANSWER CHOICE.
  - WITH THE HOODED CRIMINAL.
             - YES.

           - GOT YOU.
           DANIELLE.
     - I WOULD GO WITH THE
    STRAIGHT-LACED CRIMINAL?

  - STRAIGHT-LACED DETECTIVE.
            - OKAY.
           AND DINA.
       - THE CROOKED COP.

           [laughter]
          - IT'S OKAY.
           I LOVE IT.
          - I LOVE IT.
             OKAY.

        HERE'S OUR NEXT
       QUESTION, LADIES.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
IF I HAD A DOLLAR FOR EVERY TIME
MY HUSBAND SAID THE WORD BLANK,

     I'D BE A MILLIONAIRE.
           DANIELLE.
             - NO.
             - NO?
       LET'S GO WITH NO.

- DOES THAT APPLY TO EVERYTHING?
      - MOST OF THE TIME.
              NO.
            - OKAY.
             DINA.

    - I'D HAVE TO SAY MAYBE.
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T SAY YES OR NO
          TO ANYTHING.
   HE ALWAYS WANTS TO PLEASE,

       SO HE SAYS MAYBE.
        AND I'M LIKE NO.
       GIVE ME AN ANSWER.
          - SO MAYBE.
           ALL RIGHT.
            ANJALAY.

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY,
 IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE,
BUT HE SAYS THE WORD FACE A LOT.
            - FACE.
           LIKE HOW?

      - IT'S HIS RESPONSE.
       LIKE, CAN YOU TAKE
         THE TRASH OUT?
             FACE.
           [laughter]

          - I LOVE IT.
LADIES, OTHER THAN YOUR HUSBAND,
     GIVE US THE FIRST NAME
OF THE LAST MAN YOU HAD A SEXUAL
         FANTASY ABOUT.

  AND DON'T FEEL BAD, LADIES.
      IT'S ONLY A FANTASY.
             DINA.
  - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY DAVID.

         - WHO'S DAVID?
   - HE'S A FRIEND OF JOSH'S.
             - OH!
         audience: OOH!

            - YEAH.
  - DOES JOSH KNOW YOU'VE EVER
     HAD THIS, UH, FANTASY?

            - MAYBE.
             YEAH.
           [laughter]
     - ALL RIGHT, ANJALAY.
 - I'M GOING TO GO WITH ONE OF
       THE ACTORS I THINK

     IS REALLY ATTRACTIVE,
    AND I WOULD SAY BRADLEY.
           - BRADLEY.
        - BRADLEY COOPER
        - AS IN COOPER.
              MM.

          - HE'S CUTE.
          - VERY NICE.
           VERY NICE.
        OKAY, DANIELLE.
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH
         AN ACTOR TOO.

  I'M GONNA SAY JOSH DUHAMEL.
        - JOSH DUHAMEL.
       FERGIE'S MAN, HUH?
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.

         OKAY, LADIES.
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
        IT IS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
     FILL IN THESE BLANKS.

   BEFORE MEETING MY HUSBAND,
       I NEVER KNEW A MAN
        WHO COULD BLANK.
  AND I'M SURE MY HUSBAND WAS
   SURPRISED TO MEET A WOMAN

           - ANJALAY.
- I WOULD SAY I NEVER MET A MAN
     WHO COULD BE SO SWEET.

         audience: OH!
AND I WOULD THINK THAT IT WOULD
        GO THE SAME WAY.
     THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

     SO HE THOUGHT I COULD
          BE SO SWEET.
            - OKAY.
          - DANIELLE.
      - I NEVER MET A MAN

      WHO WOULD COME HOME
        RIGHT FROM WORK,
      AND GO RIGHT IN THE
    BATHROOM FOR 20 MINUTES.
           [laughter]

            I NEVER.
  AND I'LL SAY HE'S NEVER MET
   A GIRL THAT'S SO PERFECT.
      - THAT'S SO PERFECT.

     FARTIN' AND ALL, HUH?
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
            GOT YOU.
             DINA.

  - I DON'T THINK I COULD EVER
THOUGHT I'D FIND A MAN WHO'D BE
       SO WEIRD WITH ME,
  AND LIKE, JUST BE WEIRDNESS.
AND I'D THINK HE'D SAY THE SAME
        THING ABOUT ME.

THAT WE COULD JUST BE OURSELVES,
           AND BE...
     FREE TO BE YOU AND ME.
      - THAT'S SO AWESOME.

           [applause]
  YEAH, WHAT IS IT YOU GUYS DO
   THAT'S SO WEIRD TOGETHER?
     - WELL, BETWEEN ME AND
        YOU AND AMERICA,

 UM, LIKE, WHEN WE HAVE DINNERS
          AT OUR HOME,
  WHEN PEOPLE LEAVE THE HOME,
  WE DO LIKE A DANCE TOGETHER.
           [laughter]

     - OKAY, SO YOU EMBRACE
    EACH OTHER'S WEIRDNESS.
      - YEAH, WE LOVE IT.
            WHY NOT?
          - I LOVE IT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES.

       THANK YOU SO MUCH.

   WE'VE STILL GOT A LOT MORE
           QUESTIONS.
    HERE IS THE FIRST OF OUR

 THE STRAIGHT-LACED PERFORMER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    ANJALAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - HOODED CRIMINAL.

          [indistinct]
  - NO, THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER.
        - I DON'T KNOW.
         I GOT NOTHING.
     - [laughing] SHE SAID

            DAMIEN.
- I WOULD SAY THE STRAIGHT-LACED
           PERFORMER,

   BECAUSE THE OTHER TWO ARE

        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

     - HE'S MY CROOKED COP.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  OUR NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.

   HOW DID YOUR WIFE COMPLETE
         THIS SENTENCE?
IF I HAD A DOLLAR FOR EVERY TIME
MY HUSBAND SAID THE WORD BLANK,
     I'D BE A MILLIONAIRE.
            DAMIEN.

        - SAID I FORGOT.
          - ONE WORD.

         THAT'S TWICE.
    [laughter and applause]
       - ALL RIGHT, JOSH.

- UM, I'M GOING TO GO WITH STOP.
UM, BECAUSE SOMETIMES SHE TRIES
 TO, LIKE, TWEEZE MY EYEBROWS,
   OR DO STUFF, AND I'M JUST
        LIKE STOP, STOP.

         I DON'T KNOW.
     - I MEAN, I HEAR THAT,
    BUT I HAVE TO SAY MAYBE.
      'CAUSE LIKE YOU SAY
     MAYBE FOR EVERYTHING.

         - RIGHT, YEAH.
       THAT MAY BE RIGHT.

   IF I GET SOMETHING RIGHT,
   IF I GET SOMETHING WRONG,

     I JUST GO FACE, FACE.
     - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

     [cheers and applause]
        I've worked hard
       to build my family.
  And also to build my career.

 So I'm not about to always let
   my frequent bladder urges,
      or the worry my pipes
    might leak get in the way
     of my busy lifestyle.

     That's why I take care,
         with VESIcare.
  Once-daily VESIcare can help
   control your bladder muscle
     and is proven to treat
       overactive bladder

        with symptoms of
    frequent urges and leaks
         day and night.
 If you have certain stomach or
       glaucoma problems,

      or trouble emptying
         your bladder,
     do not take VESIcare.
   VESIcare may cause allergic
 reactions that may be serious.

  If you experience swelling of
         the face, lips,
        throat or tongue,
      stop taking VESIcare
     and get emergency help.

 Tell your doctor right away if
 you have severe abdominal pain,
 or become constipated for three
          or more days.
          VESIcare may
      cause blurred vision,

  so use caution while driving
     or doing unsafe tasks.
       Common side effects
  are dry mouth, constipation,
        and indigestion.

        I've worked hard
     to get to where I am...
       and I've got better
          places to go
           than always
     going to the bathroom.

 So take charge of your symptoms
    by talking to your doctor
     and go to vesicare.com
     for a free trial offer.
