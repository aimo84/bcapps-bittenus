        HERE IS OUR 4th GRADE

     "BILLY'S YARD IS A PERFECT

         YES.

               NO CHEATS LEFT.
           IT'S JUST YOU AND ME.

         ALL RIGHT, TALK IT OUT.
          WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
   IF BILLY'S YARD
 IS A PERFECT SQUARE,
      THAT MEANS
THERE ARE FOUR SIDES TO IT.

EACH SIDE IS 12 FEET,
WHICH WOULD MAKE TWO SIDES
       24 FEET,
AND THAT WOULD BE HALF

     "THEN HE CUTS EACH THIRD
             IN HALF.
     HOW MANY PIECES OF PIZZA

   CUT THE PIZZAS.

     WHILE YOU WERE DRIVING?
      [ LAUGHS ]

  SO, IF YOU CUT IT

THEN YOU HAVE THREE PIECES.

  WHAT BECAME THE OFFICIAL BIRD
      OF THE UNITED STATES?"

FOR SOME REASON, BALD EAGLES

I THINK THEY'RE ON THE QUARTER
    OR SOME COINS,
AND SO I'M GOING TO LOCK IN
   WITH BALD EAGLE.

WHICH IS PRETTY EMBARRASSING.
      AND, UM...

    IT'S A 2nd GRADE QUESTION.

         NO.

   YOU'VE GOT BOTH YOUR CHEATS.

         YOU HAVE A PEEK,
         YOU HAVE A COPY,
       AND YOU HAVE A SAVE.
THIS MAY BE A GOOD TIME
TO START THINKING ABOUT THEM.

              YEAH, DEFINITELY.
                  LET'S SEE.
           HERE ARE MY THOUGHTS.

            THEY'RE TALKING

         ABOUT WHATEVER THEY ARE
             REFERRING TO --
   MARKI, MAYBE THE OWL, ANIMAL,
     AND BIRD, FOR SOME REASON.
                I DON'T KNOW.

     FOUR IS POPPING IN MY MIND,
     AND I SAW HER WRITE DOWN
 AN ANSWER PRETTY QUICKLY, SO --
      OH, PLEASE HELP ME.
AND WHAT I'D LIKE TO DO IS COPY.

         Foxworthy: COPY.
               I HAVE NO CLUE.
  WHICH MEANS YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
   HER ANSWER, NO MATTER WHAT.

  NOW, IF YOU HAD HAD TO GUESS,
      YOU WOULD HAVE SAID...
    FOUR, I GUESS.
   I CAN TELL YOU THIS, JOSH --
    YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN WRONG.

  THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
            LET'S SEE
       WHAT THE CLASS SAID.
         THE QUESTION...

  EVERYONE IN THE CLASS SAID...
     ..."A," "AN," AND "THE."
          THEY ACTUALLY
        SHOWED THEIR WORK.

YEAH, THANKS FOR RUBBING IT IN.
  GOOD JOB, SPENCER.
     HERE'S THE DEAL, THOUGH.
  WHAT THEY SAID DIDN'T MATTER,

         AND, BY THE WAY,
      THEY ARE ALL CORRECT.
 WHAT SHE SAID IS THE ONLY THING
          THAT MATTERS.
         YOU BETTER HOPE
       SHE DIDN'T SAY FOUR.

         SHE SAID THREE.
    FOR $2,000, ALANA SAID...
               "3"!

         YOU GOT $2,000.

    WAS IN THE 19th CENTURY."
      YOUR CLASSMATE SPENCER
    HAS LOCKED IN HIS ANSWER.

THAT I REMEMBER IN SCHOOL --

   IN 2nd GRADE --

THAT, LIKE, THE 1800s

THE 20th CENTURY WAS REFERRING
