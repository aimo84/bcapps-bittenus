               KINDA BLISTERY.

  LIKE SOMEBODY HAD SET A BAG
  OF HOT CHARCOAL ON MY NECK.
      I WAS A FIREFIGHTER
      FOR 24 YEARS.
 BUT, I HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED
 SUCH A BURNING SENSATION

   UNTIL I HAD THE SHINGLES.
 I REMEMBER IT WELL. I WAS IN
 THE BACK YARD DOING YARD WORK.
  I HAD THIS IRRITATION GOING
  ON IN MY LOWER NECK.

  I CHANGED SHIRTS BECAUSE I
  THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING
   IN THE COLLAR OF THE SHIRT
   IRRITATING MY NECK.
   AND I COULDN'T FIGURE OUT
   WHAT WAS GOING ON.

     I HAD NO IDEA IT
     CAME FROM CHICKENPOX.
 I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHINGLES WAS
 ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE...
    A LOT OLDER THAN MYSELF.

I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE,
           IT IS BAD.
    IT'S SOMETHING YOU
    NEVER WANT TO ENCOUNTER.
