       Announcer: TONIGHT,

       IT'S THE LAST NIGHT
    OF OUR $1-MILLION MISSION.
   IT IS UP TO YOU,
     WYNNETTA...
              Oh!

           (Audience)
             Whoo!
        (Johnny Gilbert)
      From Television City
         in Hollywood,
            this is
      the $25,000 Pyramid.

  Today's special guests are:
     From "Mr. Belvedere,"
          Ilene Graff.
       and Earl Holliman.

           And, now,
       here is your host,
          Dick Clark!
      [audience cheering]

              Hey!
      Thank you very much.
       Thank you, Johnny.
        $25,000 Pyramid
      on the 8th of July,

      that's a good sign.
 We're gonna do very well here,
       I have a feeling.
 Ilene, you've got comfortable
       with the game now?

Uh-hmm.
Were you frightened
yesterday?
I wouldn't say frightened.
Terrified.
Perhaps, a little
apprehensive.
Oh.

          Yeah it is--
   It's a strange environment
      if you haven't been
          here before.
     But once you're here,
 it's sort of just flows along

   and you're partner's gonna
help you pull this off for sure.
  Meg Hogan, you are a mother
    three and anticipating,
I gather?
Yes, sir,
the 1st of November.

       First of November.
 What are the other three kids?
             A girl and two boys
            who are 3, 2, and 1.
   Are they all rooting for--
          3, 2, and 1?

They don't root...
[audience laughing]
        They only watch
        "Sesame Street."
Wow! Oh, you're gonna
have a household.

      Do they, uh, express
   any preference to that age
    as to what the newcomer
            will be?
                     My daughter
                 wants a sister.

Yeah, I can see why.
Good luck in all of that.
     They're more important
       venture than here
   but this will be fun, too.

    Earl, how are you, sir?
           I'm fine.
       How are you, Dick?
Very well and I'm ready
to go if you are.

      And Becky's sitting
          over there,
          not chewing
      her fingernails yet.
        But, uh, all is
         gonna go well.

      How much money have
     you won so far, Becky?
$1,550.
This is Becky Hessimer
         who's a hotel
      convention manager.

        You've a little
         bit of money.
     Not...not a tremendous
          amount yet.
    You can win over $50,000

    if you play things right
    in that Winner's Circle
         and accumulate
       some bonus moneys
   and prizes along the way.

     These are the subjects
      that start the game:
        We've got Shhh!,
    The Scene Of The Chime,
        Fantasy Island,
          Don't Panic,

           Rah! Rah!
         Sis Boom Bah!
         Solar Energy.
    That 7-11 is the bonus.
          We play that
      in the first round,

   then we have the Mystery 7
      in the second round.
Ilene,
where do we start?
          Don't Panic.

           Huh, huh!
        These are things
   associated with a crisis.
Things associated
with a crisis.

           Ready, go.
Uh, the top officer
in the state is the...
Governor.
Yes.

    When all the water comes
    and washes everything...
            A flood.
This is the--
The nuclear...

Bomb.
Yes.
     This is the pure thing
        that we breathe.
Air.
The gas mask comes...

Oxygen.
Right.
    This is, we get together
 for lunch and we'll have a...
A chat.
I speak...

A meeting.
Yes.
       This is where are
   the Armed Forces building.
       The five-sided...

Oh, the Pentagon.
Yes.
This is the American...
Flag.
The war that we fought
to the...American...

Civil War.
[buzzer sounds]
     Revolution was the one
      she was looking for.
     [audience applauding]

             Okay.
    Meg you got 6 out of 7.
       Pretty good score.
Earl, what would you like?
Solar Energy, Dick.

         Solar Energy.
     These are things that
       heat other things.
Things that heat
other things.

           Ready, go.
       Uh, it has a wick.
Candle.
Uh-hmm.

Uh, not a steam bath
but a...
Sauna.
   Uh, you barbecue over a...

A grill.
Yeah but...
Hibachi barbecue.
No, what you burn
in it with a fuel?
Charcoal.
Yes.

      Uh, you stoke the...
Down in the basement,
you stoke the...
Cellar, the furnace.
Yes.

      Uh, you got the heat
    that comes out of the...
        It's evaporated
         out of your...
Steam.
Yes, thank you.

   Uh, you put wood in the...
     Burned wood in the...
Fireplace.
Uh-hmm.
[buzzer sounds]
Alright, it's all tied, 6-6.

     [audience applauding]
             Yeah.
It's gonna be
a close game here.

           Meg Hogan,
      look for that 7-11.
   Where do you think it is?
Fantasy Island?
Fantasy Island, she says.

         There you go.
     [audience applauding]
It's a good opportunity
to win a little extra money.

        It doesn't count
        as score money.
    Ilene, since you're new,
        I will explain.
  Any money you win other than
     in the Winner's Circle

        is bonus money.
     And that money you win
         determines who
      comes back tomorrow.

   So this will be an $1,100
    bonus but doesn't count
            as score
     if indeed it happens.
     Meg, these are things
   associated with a fantasy.

Things associated
with a fantasy.
           Ready, go.
Um, when you sleep, you...
Dream.

   And, um, she lives in the sea
           and she has a tail...
           A mermaid.
      And you go to the...

The play is at the...
The theater.
       And I'm going to blow out
             my birthday candles
and make a...
A wish.

   And, um, in the newspaper,
there are, they make you laugh.
Oh, the funnies,
the comics.
                           Uh...
      And on TV, they have it...

           Cartoons.
        And you're in the desert
 and you see something far away.
            Mirage.

     And we're gonna go and have
        sex with lots of people.
[buzzer sounds]
Orgy.
             Orgy.

     [audience applauding]
  A little late for the orgy.
Story of my life.
Maybe...

     [Dick laughs out loud]
   I said she's a little late
          for the orgy
and she says,
"It's the story of my life."

      [audience laughing]
   Maybe...maybe better late,
         I don't know.
       The score is 12-6,
            ladies.

Uh, Becky,
what would you like?
We're gonna try Shhh!.
Shhh! Alright.
           I thought
     that was instructions.

These are words that begin
with the letters S-H.
Okay.
These words begin
with S-H.
           Ready, go.

                 Uh, this is not
                ice cream but...
Sherbet.
Uh-hmm.
          Uh, this is,
       oh, you kick a...

Shin.
This right here-- Uh-huh.
  Uh, this is a little shanty,
        it's called a...
Shack.
Uh-huh.

      And this little bush
         is called a...
Shrub.
   And this is when you yell
       real loud, you...

Shout.
No, when you scream.
Shriek.
Yes.
And this is on top of your roof,
        you have the...

Shingles.
Uh-hmm.
And this is,
oh that's a...
Shame.
Alright, they
picked a point lead.

     [audience applauding]
      Becky leads over Meg
          by a point.
     So Meg has the choice
   of The Scene Of The Crime,

   or Rah! Rah! Sis Boom Bah!
          Or Rah! Rah!
Rah! Rah!
Yeah, is that the one?
Uh-hmm.

Uh, and you'll give,
Ilene, right?
Yes, sir.
             Okay.
   Is that screen all the way
       over close to you?

Yeah.
Thank you very much.
        These are things
      at a football game.
   Things at a football game.

           Ready, go.
Uh, when they throw
the ball at you and you...
Catch it.
Yes.

       And everybody gets
      together and they...
Huddle.
       And I'm gonna take
         your picture.

Uh, the camera.
I'm the person who does it.
Photographer.
Yes.
            And, oh,
     I...I didn't catch...

A fumble.
         And it's 4-3.
The score.
Yes.

   And, uh, you did it wrong,
      you have to pay a...
Penalty.
       And I'm gonna take
  a little nip out of this...

Uh, swig.
This is the thing...
A flask.
Yes.
         That's got it.

     [audience applauding]
             19-13.
     Could be a separation
         of one point.

    Well, it's always a win
          by one point
   but I'm saying it's very,
        very close here.
Earl, you're gonna give?
Uh, yes.

Describe these things

Okay.
       They need 20 to go

     something interesting.

  She said, "You loved to see
the people win that, don't you?"
   I said, "Yes, do you know
      the real reason why?
     I don't have to add."
