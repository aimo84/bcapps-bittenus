We got a letter the other day
from an old friend

who was reminiscing about
the time I played the Pyramid.
And apparently, I don't
remember any of this.
It said I sat
in the Winner's Circle

and four times in a row, I went
to the top of the Pyramid.
And he said they never
let me play again.
Which is true,
that was when Bill Cullen

was the host
of the night time version.
So I have great sympathy
for those of you in that chair.
I remember one to this day
after this game is played,

I'll tell you which one
still sticks in my head.
I...I had nightmares
over it.
Alright, you've got to beat
$600 by the way.

You have a possibility
of getting up to $22,300
in this play as we go
for the $10,000.
Here is your first subject.

Go!
           Cruise, row, canoe...
Boats.
                           Yes.

     [audience applauding]
             Well, I'm gonna use
   the stethoscope on you and...
What a doctor says.
                           Yes.

     [audience applauding]
             A fur coat, skis...
Thing you take
on vacation.

In a winter climate.
                           Uh...
Things to do with snow.
     [audience applauding]

            The cat gut strings.
Parts of a violin.
             The fret, the pick.
Parts of a banjo.
Guitar.

     [audience applauding]
          Your nails, your ring.
Things on your fingers.

     [audience applauding]
        Marriage, a tennis game.
 Things that are matched.

             A business part...
        [buzzer sounds]
          Don't worry,
          don't worry.
           It's okay.

     [audience applauding]
       I know what it is.
You know what it is,
don't you?

Those are the things that...
        Can you stick your head
           in one these things?
 No. You know what, it isn't
 gonna make you feel any better.
But it's happened so many times
that our audience is used to it.

It's disappointing.
It has to do with pressure.
It has nothing to do
with your innate stupidity.

      [audience laughing]
I wouldn't say that
for a minute
if I thought
you'd take it seriously.

Its the anxiety
of wanting to win
and you just sort of blurt out
what's in front of you.
                         Uh-hmm.
It's things that
require a partner.

You did however
beat the $600 mark.
You're up to $750 so you're
gonna be back again.
          Thank you.
          We'll be back again
          right after this.

     [audience applauding]
      [indistinct chatter]
     Thank you very much.

          HI, FELLAS.
       all: HEY, SHERRI!
      - GREAT. THANK YOU.
           WE'VE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE

       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
    LET'S GET RIGHT INTO IT.
       ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
        YOU READY TO GO?

         - YES, MA'AM.
             - YES.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
            - SURE.
   - GENTLEMEN, AT WHAT POINT
      IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP

         WOULD YOU SAY
   THE SEX WAS THE MOST WILD?
      RIGHT AT THE START,
       RIGHT WHEN THINGS
          GOT SERIOUS,

         OR RIGHT NOW?
             MURAD.
         - I WOULD SAY
 RIGHT WHEN THINGS GOT SERIOUS,

     UH, BECAUSE AT FIRST,
           YOU KNOW,
          YOU'RE FIRST
  GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER.
        BUT WHEN YOU'RE
  COMFORTABLE WITH EACH OTHER

    AND EACH OTHER'S BODIES,
   YOU TEND TO JUST LET IT GO
      ALL OUT THE WINDOW.
             - JOE.

     - WELL, IT'S AWESOME,
      LIKE, ALL THE TIME.
   DON'T GET ME WRONG, OKAY?
            - OKAY.
      THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW.

     - WE'RE LIKE BUNNIES.
     - YOU'RE LIKE BUNNIES!
            - YEAH.
            BUT, NO,
        I--I WOULD SAY,

     UH, DEFINITELY WHEN WE
    STARTED GETTING SERIOUS.
             - OH!
       [cheers, applause]

   BECAUSE IF YOU DIDN'T GET
     THE BUNNY REFERENCE...
           [laughter]
             ALAN.
           - AH, MAN,
    I DEFINITELY WANNA SLEEP

   IN THE SAME BED TONIGHT...
            - YES...
 - SO I'M GONNA SAY RIGHT AWAY.
    I MEAN, FIRST, YOU KNOW,
     GOTTA LOOK AT MY WIFE.

       I MEAN, SHE'S HOT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
          WE ALL KNOW
     YOU TURN YOUR WIFE ON.

           BUT WHAT'S
     THE LAST THING YOU DID
   THAT GAVE HER A BORE-GASM?
              JOE.

         - A BORE-GASM?
 - A BORE--[mimics yawn]--GASM.
        - UH, I'M GONNA
       HAVE TO SAY NEVER.

          - ALL RIGHT.
 - I'M VERY CONFIDENT IN THAT.
  - YOU ARE A MANLY MAN, YOU.
             - YES.
     - OKAY. AND WHAT WOULD
         YOU SAY, ALAN?

      - I WOULD SAY NEVER.
           [chuckles]
           SHE, UH--
         SHE ENJOYS IT.
           [laughter]

     YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
          - SO NEVER.
          OKAY, MURAD,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - SEE, I'LL BE HONEST.
          I WON'T LIE.
  I THINK THE LAST TIME I DID
 IS WHEN I WAS TRYING TO CATCH
  THE YANKEES IN THE PLAYOFFS.

           [laughter]
      THEN AFTER A WHILE,
         SHE WAS LIKE,
          "ALL RIGHT,
        GET OFF OF ME."

       - OKAY. I LOVE IT.
   FINAL QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--

          I MEAN THIS
     AS A TOTAL COMPLIMENT.
         THE ONE FRIEND
          OF MY WIFE'S
        THAT WOULD MAKE
  THE MOST MONEY AS A STRIPPER

   WOULD DEFINITELY BE BLANK.
             ALAN.
   - OH, THAT'S DEFINITELY--
         EASY ANSWER--

    HER BEST FRIEND JACKIE.
   - WHAT DOES SHE LOOK LIKE?
    - BLOND, ABOUT 5'10"...
           - UH-HUH.

  - UH, WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT.
 - YOU ARE SO SHORT OF BREATH.
          LOOK AT YOU!
           [laughter]

            ALL RIGHT,
     MURAD, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - UM, THIS IS GONNA GET ME
  IN TROUBLE WITH HER FRIENDS,
        BUT NONE OF 'EM.

           [laughter]
      I THINK HER FRIENDS
    WALK IN THE FRONT DOOR,
   I WALK OUT THE BACK DOOR.

           [laughter]
           [applause]
           - OH, BOY!

         OKAY, I'M JU--
     YOU GUYS ARE NOT GONNA
     HAVE ANY FRIENDS LEFT.
     OKAY. SO YOU SAY NONE.

           ALL RIGHT.
      - I GOT MY FRIENDS.
     - JOE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - IT'S FUNNY YOU SAY THIS.
      SHE ACTUALLY TEACHES
         POLE DANCING.

          - SHE DOES?
             - YES.
        - CAN SHE LEAVE
       SOME FLYERS FOR US
      BEFORE YOU GUYS GO?
        - YES, SHE CAN.

    DEFINITELY. UM, I WOULD
  DEFINITELY HAVE TO SAY, UH,
   LITTLE STACY CUPCAKE WOULD
 PROBABLY MAKE THE MOST MONEY.

          GOT SERIOUS,
         OR RIGHT NOW?

          GOT SERIOUS?

            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, MURAD?
    WHEN THINGS GOT SERIOUS!

          - UGH, UGH!
            - YEAH!

    ALL RIGHT, JOE, HAVE YOU
ALWAYS BEEN A LITTLE SEX FREAK?
      HE SAID RIGHT WHEN
      THINGS GOT SERIOUS.

       - WHEN DID THINGS
       NOT GET SERIOUS?
           [laughter]
     - IT TOOK THREE MONTHS
      FOR ME TO GET LAID.

        [audience oohs]
        - OH, EXCUSE ME!
             - OH!
           ALL RIGHT,
   SO LET'S GO TO YOU, CINDY.

  - I'M GONNA SAY RIGHT NOW...
          - RIGHT NOW?
         - BECAUSE WE--
     BEFORE WE GOT MARRIED,
    I LIVED WITH MY PARENTS
 AND HE LIVED WITH HIS PARENTS,

    SO IT WAS KIND OF, LIKE,
WE HAD TO MATCH THEIR SCHEDULES.
       AND NOW IT'S LIKE,
    "WE GOT OUR OWN PLACE!"
            - OKAY.
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, ALAN?

            HE SAID
      RIGHT AT THE START.
            - WHAT?!
           - COME ON.
   - WHO DID YOU START WITH?

             - YOU!
           [laughter]
            OH, MAN.
   - [laughing] IT WASN'T ME.

            - ALAN!
        - I DON'T KNOW.
          - ALL RIGHT,
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
          WE ALL KNOW
   YOUR HUSBAND TURNS YOU ON,

   BUT WHAT'S THE LAST THING
         HE SAID HE DID
   THAT GAVE YOU A BORE-GASM?
            LAUREN.

     - UH, NOTHING. REALLY.
       - OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
    WELL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        HE SAID NOTHING.

        HIS VIDEO GAMES.

         both: NOTHING.
         - OH, COME ON!

          I THOUGHT...
   - IT'S ALWAYS THE FINGERS
        GOING THIS WAY.
       - ALL RIGHT. YEAH,
I DO PLAY A LOT OF VIDEO GAMES.

            - OKAY.
- GUESS THAT'S THE ONLY JOYSTICK
     THAT I'LL BE PLAYING.

           [applause]
   - THESE TWO ARE ON A ROLL!
            ALL RIGHT,
     MAYRA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - I WOULD SAY NOTHING.
      I MEAN, HE REALLY--
        HE--HE KNOWS HOW
    TO WORK HIS MAGIC ON ME.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     MURAD, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

           - I GUESS
    I UNDERESTIMATED MYSELF.
 - YEAH, HE WAS TRYING TO CATCH
  THE YANKEES IN THE PLAYOFFS.
           REMEMBER?
         - OH, REALLY?

    I THINK YOU SHOULD SLEEP
      IN THE GUESTROOM...
            - AW...
    - AND WATCH THE YANKEES.
   - WE ARE NOT STARTING OFF
        GOOD RIGHT NOW.

           [laughter]
     LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO
   SOMETHING DIFFERENT HERE.
  LADIES, HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

          I MEAN THIS
     AS A TOTAL COMPLIMENT.
         THE ONE FRIEND
          OF MY WIFE'S
        THAT WOULD MAKE
  THE MOST MONEY AS A STRIPPER

   WOULD DEFINITELY BE BLANK.
             CINDY.
  - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH
       MY FRIEND JACKIE.

          - ALL RIGHT.

       - THAT'S CORRECT.
           - JACKIE!

           - [laughs]
  - GETTING BACK IN THAT BED!
         THERE YOU GO!
           - FINALLY.

           - ALL RIGHT,
     MAYRA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - MY FRIEND KIANA,
      EVEN THOUGH SHE'S...

           [laughter]
      JUST BECAUSE SHE'S--
       SHE'S REAL FREAKY.

            - OKAY.
    MURAD, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
         WAS IT KIANA?
            HE SAID
     NONE OF YOUR FRIENDS.

           - OH, WOW.
              OKAY.
   - I'M SORRY. I LIKE KIANA,
 BUT I DON'T THINK I'D PAY HER
     TO SEE HER GET NAKED.

            - UM...
           - [laughs]
           - ALL RIGHT,
    LAUREN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - PROBABLY MYSELF,

        UM, BECAUSE I AM
    A POLE DANCE INSTRUCTOR.
          MY SIDE JOB.
     SO HE KNOWS WHAT I GOT
     AND HOW I CAN WORK IT.

 'CAUSE WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED
       IN TAKING A CLASS.

       [cheers, applause]
       - YOU GOT A POLE?
    - WE DON'T HAVE A POLE,
     BUT MAYBE SOMETHING--
    YOU CAN JUST SHOW US...
            - OKAY.

       - JUST ON THE SIDE

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
        IT IS YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.

        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
         ARE YOU READY?
          HERE WE GO.

       LADIES, WHICH PART
         OF LOVEMAKING
        DOES YOUR HUSBAND
      ZOOM THROUGH SO FAST
       YOU WANNA GIVE HIM
      A SPEEDING TICKET--

         THE SEDUCTION,
         THE FOREPLAY,
      OR THE DEED ITSELF?
             MAYRA.

     - DEFINITELY FOREPLAY.
        HE JUST WANTS TO
          GET IT GOING
           AND HIT IT
        OUT OF THE PARK.

        THAT'S HIS GOAL.
    SO DEFINITELY FOREPLAY.
 - JUST LIKE THAT YANKEE GAME.
       - YUP, DEFINITELY.
           - LAUREN.

          - DEFINITELY
        THE DEED ITSELF.
      LISTEN, BECAUSE WE--
     WE DO IT LIKE BUNNIES.
      YOU KNOW? BUT YEAH.
   - SO IT'S THE DEED ITSELF.

     WELL, I SEE WHY AFTER
  THAT DANCE YOU GAVE THE BOY.
           - [laughs]
      - WHO WANTS TO STOP?
           ALL RIGHT,
 SO WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, CINDY?

         - SEDUCTION...
          - SEDUCTION.
      - 'CAUSE USUALLY HIS
       IS JUST ONE LINE.
     IT'S JUST, "HEY, BABY,
  YOU WANNA MAKE A SEXY TIME?"

          AND THAT'S--
           THAT'S IT.
            THAT'S IT.
           [laughter]

   - LADIES, IF YOUR HUSBAND
      WAS LEGALLY ALLOWED
   TO TAKE ON ANOTHER WIFE...
          - OH, YEAH!
            - WHOO!

       [cheers, laughter]
   - WHAT WOULD BE THE FIRST
     MARITAL RESPONSIBILITY
      YOU WOULD HAND OVER
      TO YOUR SISTER WIFE?

            LAUREN.
      - PAYING THE BILLS.
            [laughs]
      - PAYING THE BILLS?

        - BECAUSE IT IS
    SUCH A PAIN IN THE BUTT.
      HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
    HIS OWN ACCOUNT NUMBER.
            - YEAH.
          - IT'S BAD.

      - ALL RIGHT, CINDY.
 - ALAN DOESN'T EXACTLY OPERATE
    BASED OFF OF HIS BRAIN.
           - MM-HMM.

         - HE OPERATES
   BASED OFF OF HIS STOMACH.
      I HAVE TO COOK FOOD
  TO GET HIM TO DO SOMETHING,
      SO I'D SAY COOKING.

    - SO YOU'D SAY GIVE HER
          THE COOKING.
           ALL RIGHT.
           AND MAYRA.
     - DEFINITELY CLEANING.
      I HAVE TO BRIBE HIM

    FROM PLAYING VIDEO GAMES
  AND WATCHING THE YANKEE GAME
           TO, LIKE,
     EVEN PICK UP A BROOM.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     NEXT QUESTION, WIVES.

         NOW A QUESTION
      FROM ELF COSMETICS,
   WHERE YOUR BEAUTIFUL EYES,
         LIPS, AND FACE
           DON'T COST
       AN ARM AND A LEG.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
  THE FAMOUS PHRASE "BEAUTY IS
  IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER"
         MUST BE TRUE,

       BECAUSE MY HUSBAND
    KEEPS WEARING HIS BLANK,
  AND I CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHY.
             CINDY.

        - HIS UNDERWEAR.
    HE LOVES HIS UNDERWEAR.
     IT'S A DIFFERENT PAIR
        IN THE MORNING,
        A DIFFERENT PAIR
WHEN HE GOES TO BED. HE JUST...

- OKAY, WELL, AT LEAST YOU KNOW
   HE LIKES TO BE CLEAN, HUH?
          OKAY. MAYRA.
          - DEFINITELY
      HIS WHITE T-SHIRTS,

       'CAUSE HE'S ALWAYS
         WEARING THEM.
          - T-SHIRTS.
            LAUREN.
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
 MY HUSBAND'S CRAZY SUNGLASSES.

           - MM-HMM.
        - THEY'RE, LIKE,
              THESE
   CRAZY-COLOR-LOOKIN' THINGS
         THAT HE WEARS
        WHEN WE GO OUT.

           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.
             - OKAY.
           ALL RIGHT.
          NOW, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
            COMPLETE
    THIS SENTENCE, LADIES--

     LOOKING BACK TO WHEN I
   FIRST SIZED UP MY HUSBAND,
        I WAS DEAD WRONG
    IN THINKING HE WAS BLANK
          AND DEAD ON
   IN THINKING HE WAS BLANK.

             MAYRA.
    - THINKING THAT HE CAN--
         HE CAN CLEAN.
         I DON'T KNOW.
           - MM-HMM.

    - AND DEAD ON IN KNOWING
 HE CAN WORK IT IN THE BEDROOM.
       - OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
    LAUREN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

           - THAT HE
      WOULD NEVER GROW UP.
          - ALL RIGHT.
           - AND, UH,
        RECENTLY HE DID.

      - WHEN'D HE GROW UP?
          - LAST WEEK.
         both: [laugh]

      - DEFINITELY DEAD ON
    IN, UH, KNOWING HE WOULD
     DEFINITELY BE A FREAK.
    - CINDY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

         - I WOULD SAY
        I WAS DEAD WRONG
            THINKING
       THAT HE CAN CLEAN,
        AND I WOULD SAY
          I'M DEAD ON

     THAT HE'S JUST NERDY.
            - YEAH.
     - EVERYTHING HE DOES,
   HE SAYS, IT'S JUST NERDY.
      - BUT HE'S SO CUTE.
           - [laughs]

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
        WE'RE GONNA SEE

    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

       HERE IS THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.

           GENTLEMEN,
    WHICH PART OF LOVEMAKING
        DID YOU WIFE SAY
    YOU ZOOM THROUGH SO FAST
     SHE WANTS TO GIVE YOU
      A SPEEDING TICKET--

         THE SEDUCTION,
         THE FOREPLAY,
      OR THE DEED ITSELF?
             MURAD.

  - I'LL GET IN TROUBLE AGAIN,
   BUT I THINK I'M GONNA SAY
         THE FOREPLAY.
          - ALL RIGHT,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

   - AND SOMETIMES I RUSH IT
        'CAUSE I WANNA--

        I JUST WANT IT.
        - OKAY, LAUREN,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        THE DEED ITSELF.

       - THE DEED ITSELF?
    [audience oohs, laughs]
          - ALL RIGHT,
     ALAN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

  - AH, MAN, I THINK IT WOULD

  IF YOU WERE LEGALLY ALLOWED

     WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY

       WOULD BE THE FIRST
     MARITAL RESPONSIBILITY
  SHE WOULD HAND OVER TO HER?
              JOE.

      - THIS IS VERY EASY.
            - YEAH.
    - 'CAUSE SHE DOESN'T DO
          A LOT OF IT.
            COOKING.

           - COOKING?
     - DEFINITELY COOKING.
     - SO WHAT DID YOU SAY,
            LAUREN?
   SHE SAID PAYING THE BILLS.

            - BILLS.
     LISTEN, I LIKE TO COOK
   ONCE A MONTH WHEN I DO IT.
        I DON'T MIND IT.

           [laughter]
     IT'S PAYING THE BILLS
        EVERY SINGLE DAY
        THAT'S ANNOYING.

       - ALL RIGHT, ALAN,
       WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
          WITH COOKING,
  BECAUSE I'M A TERRIBLE COOK,

         AND, YOU KNOW,
    SHE'S BUSY ALL THE TIME
      WITH ALL HER CHORES
        AND ACTIVITIES.
         - OKAY. CINDY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

            COOKING!
             - YAY!
            - YEAH!
           - [laughs]

          - [laughs]
      - ALL RIGHT, MURAD,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         - I THINK THIS
     SHOULD BE AN EASY ONE.

  UM, I'M GONNA SAY CLEANING,
ESPECIALLY OUR HARDWOOD FLOORS,
'CAUSE THEY'RE DARK, AND THERE'S
  DOG HAIR ALL OVER THE PLACE.
           - MM-HMM.
  - LIKE, IT COMES REAL QUICK.

           SO I THINK
    I GOT THAT RIGHT ANSWER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    MAYRA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           CLEANING!

          - NICE! UGH!

           - LISTEN,
      I BUY THEM FOR HIM.
        IT'S NOT MY FAULT
     HE DOESN'T CHANGE 'EM.
    - BUT IF YOU BUY 'EM...

  BUT IF YOU BUY 'EM FOR HIM,
       WHERE DO THEY GO?
      YOU CAN'T JUST EXIST
        WITH FIVE PAIR.
 GOTTA PUT TOGETHER SOME MONEY

  GENTLEMAN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
     LOOKING BACK TO WHEN I
   FIRST SIZED UP MY HUSBAND,

        I WAS DEAD WRONG
   IN THINKING HE WAS BLANK,
      AND I WAS DEAD ON
  IN THINKING HE WAS BLANK.
              JOE.

      - MAYBE SHE THOUGHT
         I WAS SMALLER
    THAN WHAT I REALLY WAS.
           [laughter]

       AND THEN MAYBE...
       - SHE WAS DEAD ON.
      - SHE WAS DEAD RIGHT
    THAT I FIT HER PERFECT.
           - THAT YOU
       FIT HER PERFECTLY.

        [audience oohs]
       I SEE WHY YOU GUYS
        ARE LIKE BUNNIES
         ALL THE TIME.

     ABSOLUTELY. ALL RIGHT,
   LAUREN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - SAID SHE WAS DEAD ON
         ABOUT THE FACT
            THAT YOU
      WOULD NEVER GROW UP.

     DEAD WRONG ABOUT THAT.
      AND SHE WAS DEAD ON
ABOUT THE FACT YOU WERE A FREAK.
            SO, NO,
    YOU DIDN'T GET ANYTHING.

           I'M SORRY.
         I'M SO SORRY.
         - [grunting]
            - ALAN.

       SHE WAS DEAD WRONG
         IN THINKING...
      - THAT I WAS NERDY.
     - SHE WAS DEAD WRONG.
  AND THEN SHE WAS DEAD ON...
    - AND THEN DEAD ON WAS,

         I GUESS, SEXY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
     CINDY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - WHO DID YOU MARRY?
           [laughter]

      - SHE WAS DEAD WRONG
IN THINKING YOU COULDN'T CLEAN,
      BUT SHE WAS DEAD ON
  IN THINKING YOU WERE NERDY.
           [laughter]
         - YOU <i>ARE</i> NERDY!

    WHAT YOU WOULD'VE SAID.
      - SHE WAS DEAD WRONG
    IN THINKING I'M PROBABLY

  THAT DOESN'T CARE AND STUFF.

            - OKAY.
  - BUT WOULD'VE BEEN DEAD ON
           IN THINKING
       I'M, LIKE, A SOFTY
        AND A SWEETHEART
           AFTER ALL.

            - OKAY.
            - YEAH.
    - MAYRA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     DEAD WRONG IN THINKING
        YOU COULD CLEAN,

    AND DEAD ON IN THE FACT
     THAT YOU COULD WORK IT
        IN THE BEDROOM.
     BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

             HELLO!
          HI! WELCOME
      TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>

       NOW, WE HAVE SENT
      THE WIVES BACKSTAGE
  SO WE CAN ASK THEIR HUSBANDS
        SOME QUESTIONS.
    ARE YOU READY, HUSBANDS?
         - YES, WE ARE!

            - OKAY.
       LET'S GET STARTED.
 IF YOUR WIFE'S NETHER REGIONS
          WERE A TOWN,
    WOULD YOU BE CONSIDERED
           THE MAYOR,

      A RESPECTED CITIZEN,
     OR THE VILLAGE IDIOT?
           [laughter]
             LANCE.
      - I'D BE THE MAYOR.

   - YOU WOULD BE THE MAYOR.
 - YES, 'CAUSE I RUN ALL THAT.
             - OH!
     - ANY QUESTIONS ASKED,
       I TAKE CARE OF IT.

     - YOU RUN ALL OF THAT.
         - ALL OF THAT.
     - THERE'S NOTHING THAT
IS NOT UNDER YOUR JURISDICTION.
          - NOTHING--
       FROM HEAD TO TOE.

          - OH! WHOA.
       ALL RIGHT. JASON.
        - I'M THE MAYOR.
      STRAIGHT UP, MAYOR.
- OKAY. GOT TWO MAYORS IN HERE.
     BRADY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
      TO GO AHEAD AND SAY
      A RESPECTED CITIZEN.
       - OH! AND TELL ME
WHY YOU'RE A RESPECTED CITIZEN.

         - WELL, SHE'S
      PREGNANT RIGHT NOW.
      THINGS HAVE CHANGED
   A LITTLE BIT IN THAT AREA,
             SO...
            [laughs]

  - OKAY. ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
       OUR NEXT QUESTION.
   WHAT'S THE LAST THING YOU
PROMISED YOUR WIFE YOU WOULD DO
    BUT STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN
         AROUND TO YET?

             JASON.
 - TAKING MY TOWEL OFF THE BED
       FROM THIS MORNING.
 - YOU LEAVE STUFF ON THE BED?
 - WHEN I GET OUT OF THE SHOWER

     AND I'M GETTING READY,
         I DON'T, LIKE,
     HAVE ANYWHERE TO SIT,
 SO I PUT MY TOWEL ON THE BED,
  AND I GET READY ON THE BED,
       AND SHE HATES IT.

       AND IT'S PROBABLY
     STILL SITTING THERE...
          - RIGHT NOW.
      - EIGHT HOURS LATER.
       - OKAY, SO LEAVING
     THE TOWEL ON THAT BED.

       ALL RIGHT, BRADY.
    - I WORK A LOT OF HOURS,
      SO WHEN I GET HOME,
  THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO
   IS INSTALL ANOTHER FLOOR.

    BUT SHE WANTS ME TO REDO
       THE BEDROOM FLOOR,
    AND I'M KIND OF SLACKING
            ON THAT.
    - HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?
        - ABOUT A YEAR.

  - OH, MY--SHE MIGHT AS WELL
         HIRE SOMEBODY.
 - NO, I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
- YOU DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.
    - I WANT IT DONE RIGHT.
 - OKAY. LANCE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

          - EXERCISE.
       - YEAH, YOU KNOW.
 AND WE JUST HAD A LITTLE BABY,
 AND I DONE GAINED SOME WEIGHT.
           - UH-HUH.

       AND, YEAH, I STILL
     HAVEN'T EXERCISED YET.
           - GOT IT.
           ALL RIGHT.
           HUSBANDS,
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

 SOMETIMES I WONDER IF MY WIFE
     WORKS FOR THE C.I.A.,
         BECAUSE SHE'S
    SO INCREDIBLY SECRETIVE
        ABOUT HER BLANK.

             BRADY.
           - PROBABLY
     HER WEIGHT RIGHT NOW,
           ESPECIALLY
     'CAUSE SHE'S PREGNANT.

            - YEAH.
         - AND, LANCE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
          - I WOULD GO
       WITH WEIGHT, TOO.

  - YOU WOULD GO WITH WEIGHT?
 - YEAH. SHE JUST HAD THE BABY,
     SO I WOULD DEFINITELY
          SAY WEIGHT.
      - ALL RIGHT. JASON.

          - HER HEART.
           - UH-HUH.
 - SHE'S GOT THE GREATEST HEART
         IN THE WORLD.
   AND WHEN SHE FINALLY TALKS
   TO YOU, YOU GET TO SEE IT.

         - OH, IS THAT
     THE ANSWER THAT JUST--
THAT JUST MAKES YOU WANT TO CRY.
      - ONLY IF IT GETS ME
         EXTRA POINTS.
            - YEAH!

           [laughter]
I HOPE IT GETS YOU SOME POINTS,
 'CAUSE IT WAS A GREAT ANSWER.
   THANK YOU SO MUCH, FELLAS.
     REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

   I HOPE YOUR WIVES' ANSWERS
          MATCH YOURS,
       BECAUSE THE COUPLE
      WITH THE MOST POINTS
     AT THE END OF THE GAME

    IS GONNA WIN A FANTASTIC

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS,

         SO HERE WE GO.
 LADIES, IF YOUR NETHER REGIONS
          WERE A TOWN,
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
     HE WOULD BE CONSIDERED

           THE MAYOR,
      A RESPECTED CITIZEN,
     OR THE VILLAGE IDIOT?
           - [laughs]
           - LEANDRA.

          - THE MAYOR.
   - OH! WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
    - 'CAUSE HE'S THE BOSS.
             - OH!
      HE'S THE BOSS? OKAY.

    WHAT DID YOU SAY, LANCE?
       HE SAID THE MAYOR!
             - YES!
    - WAY TO GO, SWEETHEART!

     [cheers and applause]
       - OKAY, CHRISTINA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - OH, I'D DEFINITELY
   HAVE TO GO WITH THE MAYOR.

- NOW, WHY DO YOU SAY THE MAYOR?
  - 'CAUSE HE'S ALWAYS THERE.
       - NEVER GOES AWAY.
HE JUST TAKES CARE OF HIS TOWN.
           - EXACTLY.
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?

           THE MAYOR!
          both: YEAH!
             - YES.
        NOW, CHRISTINA,
 YOU GOT TO TELL ME THIS STORY

     ABOUT YOUR FIRST DATE.
         WHAT HAPPENED?
       - WELL, MY FATHER
         DROPPED ME OFF

 TO MEET THIS ONE OVER HERE...
           - UH-HUH.
   - AND DECIDED TO CAMP OUT
     AND STAY A LITTLE BIT
          AND WATCH US

AND MAKE SURE THAT HE WAS DOING
     ALL THE RIGHT THINGS,
      MAKE SURE HE OPENED
        MY DOOR, AND...
    - AND WHAT DID YOU THINK
       ABOUT THAT, JASON?

        - I DIDN'T KNOW.
       - YOU DIDN'T KNOW?
 - BUT I DID EVERYTHING RIGHT.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
       - WELL, WE'LL SEE
   HOW GOOD YOU ARE, 'CAUSE--

     YOUR DAD IS RIGHT HERE
        IN THE AUDIENCE.
          HELLO, RICK.
       HOW ARE YOU DOING?
   - I'M DOING GOOD, SHERRI.
  - OKAY, YOU HAVE TO TELL ME,

   YOU ACTUALLY FOLLOWED THEM
         ON THEIR DATE?
  - WELL, I DROPPED HER OFF...
           - UH-HUH.
        - AND, YOU KNOW,
      I ACTED LIKE I LEFT,

     BUT I WENT AND PARKED.
           - [laughs]
     - AND I FOLLOWED THEM
          FOR PROBABLY
    ABOUT THREE MILES OR SO,

  TOOK HIS LICENSE PLATE DOWN,
          YOU KNOW...
 - SO ARE YOU, LIKE, AN EX-COP?
  - NO, I'M AN ITALIAN FATHER.
             - OH!

    AND THERE YOU HAVE IT--
      THE ITALIAN FATHER.
           - EXACTLY.
    - SO YOU GOT THAT POINT.
  NOW WE'RE ON TO YOU, ERICA.

      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
         - I WOULD SAY
      A RESPECTED CITIZEN,
'CAUSE EVERYTHING'S PRETTY MUCH
   50/50 IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

      - ALL RIGHT, BRADY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  HE SAID A RESPECTED CITIZEN!
          - ALL RIGHT!
       - THAT'S SO GREAT!

       ALL RIGHT, HERE'S
  THE SECOND QUESTION, LADIES.
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
       WAS THE LAST THING
        HE PROMISED YOU
          HE WOULD DO

    BUT STILL HASN'T GOTTEN
       AROUND TO IT YET?
           CHRISTINA.
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
   TO STOP BITING HIS NAILS,

          'CAUSE HE'S
  JUST CONSTANTLY DOING THAT.
   - JASON, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - I SAID...
- TAKING HIS TOWEL OFF THE BED.

             - OH.
      - ONE OR THE OTHER.
     - THOSE ARE TWO THINGS
           THAT ANNOY
      THE HELL OUT OF HER.

     - THAT BUGS YOU, TOO?
 - YEAH! HE PUTS THE WET TOWEL
          ON THE BED!
 I MEAN, IT GETS STUFF ALL WET.
       - OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
     ERICA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
   REDOING OUR BEDROOM FLOOR,
      BECAUSE HE DOES THAT
         FOR A LIVING,
  AND TRYING TO GET HIM TO DO
  ANYTHING WHEN HE COMES HOME

     IS LIKE PULLING TEETH
           WITH HIM.
    - HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN?
         - UM, LIKE...
   SINCE WE'VE HAD OUR DOG--
        FIVE YEARS AGO.

       - FIVE YEARS AGO?
      WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.
    BRADY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        HE SAID REDOING
       THE BEDROOM FLOOR.

            - NO...
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
         - YOU GOT IT.
            [laughs]
       - I WAS THINKING.
         I'M LIKE, YAY!

 - NOT FIVE YEARS AGO, THOUGH.
         I SAID A YEAR.
- ERICA, WHAT IS IT GONNA TAKE?
   WHEN ARE YOU GONNA DO IT?
        ARE WE GONNA BE,
  LIKE, TEN YEARS FROM NOW...

             - NO.
     - HE SAYS BY THE TIME
 THE BABY COMES THAT WE'LL HAVE
  A NEW FLOOR IN THE BEDROOM.
        - YOU PROMISE--
  BY THE TIME THE BABY COMES?

 - SO, WHAT, FIVE MORE MONTHS,
        SIX MORE MONTHS?
     - YEAH, YOU'RE BUYING
      YOURSELF SOME TIME.
           [laughter]

     - ALL RIGHT, LEANDRA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
          - MY HUSBAND
       LOVES COUGH DROPS,
   AND HE LEAVES THE WRAPPERS
      ALL OVER THE HOUSE.

        HE BALLS 'EM UP
     AS IF BALLING THEM UP
 IS GONNA MAKE THEM INVISIBLE,
  AND THEY'RE GONNA DISAPPEAR.
 AND YOU FIND THEM EVERYWHERE.
         - EVERYWHERE?

    OKAY. WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       LIFT UP YOUR CARD.
       HE SAID EXERCISE.
          - EXERCISE!

       - YEAH, THAT TOO,
      THAT TOO, THAT TOO.
           [laughter]
  - IT'S ALL RIGHT, BEAUTIFUL.
     I'LL LET YOU MAKE IT.

          - ALL RIGHT.
        LADIES, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

       SOMETIMES I WONDER
IF MY WIFE WORKS FOR THE C.I.A.,
         BECAUSE SHE'S
    SO INCREDIBLY SECRETIVE
        ABOUT HER BLANK.

             ERICA.
  - MAYBE MY SHOPPING HABITS?
  I HIDE THINGS IN THE TRUNK.
             - OH!

   DID YOU KNOW THAT, BRADY?
          - OH, YEAH.
           - UH-HUH.
             OKAY.
       - SPENDING MONEY.

    - BRADY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      HE SAID YOUR WEIGHT.
       - YOU'RE PREGNANT.
- YOU KEEP YOUR WEIGHT A SECRET.
         - YEAH, I'M--
    - RIGHT NOW ESPECIALLY.

    - YEAH, BUT THAT'S DUMB.
        I DON'T DO THAT.
           - WELL...
        - OKAY, LEANDRA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

     - YEAH, I'M GONNA HAVE
      TO SAY WITH SHOPPING
      AND SPENDING MONEY.
      - IT'S THE SHOPPING.
           ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - IT'S GONNA BE
         A LONG NIGHT.
           [laughter]
           - WEIGHT.

    - WELL, YOU KNOW, BABY,
  YOU KNOW, WHEN THE DOCTOR--
         YOU DON'T LIKE
      TO GET ON THE SCALE.
           I'M SORRY!

       - YOU KNOW, LANCE,
      I THINK YOU PROBABLY
     NEED TO LEAVE IT ALONE
           AND KISS.
            - YEAH.
     - HE KNOWS MY WEIGHT.

       I JUST HAD A BABY.
    I TELL HIM ALL THE TIME!
       - BUT HE DID SAY--
  HE SAID IT'S ABOUT THE BABY.
         SO HE'S TRYING
        TO GET BACK IN--

     OKAY, WELL, I'M GONNA
      LEAVE IT ALONE, TOO.
           [laughter]
   CHRISTINA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
           WITH FOOD,
  'CAUSE I'VE HIDDEN DOUGHNUTS
      IN DRAWERS BEFORE...
       - HAVE YOU REALLY?
  - TO KEEP 'EM AWAY FROM HIM.

         - OKAY, JASON,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           - AH, MAN,
     I WAS GONNA SAY THAT,
         AND I DIDN'T.

     - HE SAID YOUR HEART.
      - I SAID YOUR HEART.
  - WHAT? WHAT'S SO SECRETIVE
        ABOUT MY HEART?
 - 'CAUSE YOU'RE A JERSEY GIRL.
YOU'RE, LIKE, IN PEOPLE'S FACE.

        BUT WHEN PEOPLE
        GET TO KNOW YOU,
            THEY SEE
      THAT INSIDE OF YOU,
         AND THEN THEY
     FALL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

             - AW!
     - HALF CREDIT, RIGHT?
           - THANKS.
       - THAT WAS SWEET.

    - THAT'S A GREAT ANSWER,
 ESPECIALLY WHEN FATHER-IN-LAW
       IS SITTING THERE.
      ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.

     OKAY, BRADY AND ERICA,

        IT IS YOUR TURN
           TO ANSWER
        A FEW QUESTIONS.

        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
          HERE WE GO.
    IF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND

       THREW A FEW STEAKS
          ON THE GRILL
        RIGHT BEFORE YOU
    DUCKED INTO THE BEDROOM
     FOR A PRIVATE PICNIC,

     HOW WOULD THESE STEAKS
        HAVE BEEN COOKED
   BY THE TIME YOU FINISHED--
       RARE, MEDIUM WELL,
         OR WELL DONE?

            LEANDRA.
       - VERY WELL DONE.
       - VERY WELL DONE,
'CAUSE THE MAYOR'S COOKIN', HUH?
       - [laughing] YES!
          - CHRISTINA.

       - I'D HAVE TO SAY
          MEDIUM WELL.
   - WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
      - 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
      WE'RE NOT TOO FAST,
 BUT WE'RE NOT TAKING FOREVER.

       WE GOT TO GET TO--
 I GOT TO GET TO THAT POINT OF,
          YOU KNOW...
  - HOW IS THIS, TALKING ABOUT
 ALL THIS IN FRONT OF YOUR DAD?

     - AH, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
          - HE'S LIKE,
   "I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER."
           ALL RIGHT.

          OKAY, ERICA.
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
          MEDIUM WELL,
 'CAUSE BRADY'S FAVORITE THING
        TO EAT IS STEAK,

     SO HE'D TRY TO GIVE ME
      A LITTLE ATTENTION,
       BUT HE'D PROBABLY
    IN THE BACK OF HIS MIND
    BE THINKING ABOUT STEAK
        THE WHOLE TIME.

            - OKAY.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

 I KNOW INSIDE EVERY GROWN MAN
        IS A LITTLE BOY,
       BECAUSE MY HUSBAND
     BECOMES A SIX-YEAR-OLD
      WHENEVER HE BLANKS.

           CHRISTINA.
      - WHEN HE GETS SICK.
      - WHEN HE GETS SICK?
       - YEAH, HE GETS--

        - DOES HE WHINE?
       - YEAH, HE WANTS--
       YOU KNOW, HE WANTS
      TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.
            - OKAY.
     ERICA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
           THE SAME.
        WHEN HE'S SICK,
       THE WORLD HAS COME
        TO A DEAD STOP.

           - REALLY?
- LIKE, HE'S DYING ON THE COUCH.
      LIKE, HE CAN'T MOVE
    IF HIS NOSE IS RUNNING.
           [laughter]

          AND I'M NOT
   VERY SYMPATHETIC, SO--NO.
     - ALL RIGHT, LEANDRA.
         - HIS TEMPER.
      WHEN HE GETS ANGRY.
            - YEAH?

       - YEAH, YOU KNOW.
   - DOES HE HAVE A TANTRUM?
     - YEAH, AND I'M LIKE,
       "YOU'RE NOT ACTING
    LIKE AN ADULT RIGHT NOW.
           NOT CUTE."

           [laughter]
        - OKAY, LADIES,
    IF YOU WERE TO DRESS UP
 AS YOUR HUSBAND FOR HALLOWEEN,

         WHAT WOULD BE
      THE ESSENTIAL PIECE
        OF YOUR COSTUME?
             ERICA.
       - HIS DIRTY JEANS.

 HE INSTALLS FLOORING ALL DAY,
       AND HE COMES HOME,
  AND JUST DISGUSTING, HOLE-Y,
    CONCRETE-DUSTED JEANS...

       - NOW, HOW DO YOU
     REALLY FEEL ABOUT IT?
     - THEY'RE DISGUSTING,
     AND, UGH, IT'S GROSS.
      - GOT YOU. LEANDRA.

  - I'M GONNA SAY HIS PANTS...
          - HIS PANTS.
  - OF HIS COSTUME, 'CAUSE HE
  DOESN'T LIKE 'EM TOO TIGHT,
  'CAUSE THEY HUG HIS PACKAGE.
           - UH-HUH.

   - AND HE DOESN'T LIKE 'EM
           TOO LOOSE,
  'CAUSE THEN THEY FALL DOWN--
         SO HIS PANTS.
 - HIS PANTS WOULD BE IT. OKAY.
   CHRISTINA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
  WITH HIS AVIATOR SUNGLASSES,
       'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
   MY HUSBAND'S A ROCK STAR.
   - ALL RIGHT. OKAY, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
LADIES, COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
        MY HUSBAND COULD
   DEFINITELY SHOW MY LAST EX

  A THING OR TWO ABOUT BLANK,
    BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
     MY LAST EX COULD GIVE
   MY HUSBAND A FEW POINTERS
           ON BLANK.

        [audience oohs]
            MM-HMM!
            LEANDRA,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

 - HE COULD GIVE MY EX POINTERS
       ABOUT MAKING LOVE.
            - OKAY.
  - AND THEN MY EX COULD GIVE
      MY HUSBAND POINTERS

      ABOUT DOING LAUNDRY.
           - GOT IT.
           CHRISTINA.
     - MY HUSBAND PROBABLY
  COULD GIVE MY EX TIPS ON...

     BEING A SENSITIVE MAN.
            - OKAY.
     - AND THEN MY EX COULD
  PROBABLY TEACH MY HUSBAND...

            NOTHING.
      - ALL RIGHT. ERICA.
- IT'S KIND OF A HARD QUESTION,
         'CAUSE I DATED
      BRADY'S BEST FRIEND.

         - WHAT? WHAT?
       - THAT WAS, LIKE,
        A LONG TIME AGO,
           AND THAT'S
      HOW BRADY AND I MET.

         AND SO, LIKE,
      I WOULD SAY ABOUT--
    MAYBE HE COULD TEACH HIM
     ABOUT BEING SENSITIVE
         AND ROMANTIC,
'CAUSE HE WAS KIND OF A DUMMY...

 - OKAY. AND SO THE BEST FRIEND
      COULD TEACH BRADY...
           - NOTHING.
        - OKAY, GOT IT.
      ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU
        SO MUCH, LADIES.

        WHEN WE RETURN,
        WE'RE GONNA SEE
       IF THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

     THEIR WIVES' ANSWERS.

           LET'S SEE
       HOW WELL THEY DO.
        HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
           GENTLEMEN,

   IF YOU AND YOUR WIFE THREW
   A FEW STEAKS ON THE GRILL
        RIGHT BEFORE YOU
    DUCKED INTO THE BEDROOM
     FOR A PRIVATE PICNIC,

     HOW DID YOUR WIFE SAY
          THESE STEAKS
      WOULD'VE BEEN COOKED
   BY THE TIME YOU FINISHED--
       RARE, MEDIUM WELL,
         OR WELL DONE?

             LANCE.
           [laughter]
  - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY WELL,
      WELL, WELL, WELL...

           WELL DONE!
         - WELL, WELL,
       WELL, WELL, WELL.
  - 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT
   TO GET ALL THE ACTION IN.

           [laughter]
          - ALL RIGHT.
   LEANDRA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           WELL DONE.
       - WAY TO GO, BABY.

        - THAT'S RIGHT.
    [laughter and applause]
         - [muttering]

    - JASON, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I WOULD SAY MEDIUM WELL,
          BECAUSE YOU
    GOT TO KEEP COMING BACK.

     IF IT'S TOO WELL DONE,
       IT'S ALREADY DONE.
            - OKAY.
       - IT'S TOO BURNT.
     - YOU GOT TO COME BACK
         FOR SOME MORE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
           CHRISTINA,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          MEDIUM WELL!
            - YEAH!

  WE'RE GONNA PUT SOME STEAKS
     ON THE GRILL TONIGHT.
    - WHAT ABOUT YOU, BRADY?

     - YOU KNOW, IT VARIES,
     BUT FOR THE MOST PART,
       IT'S MEDIUM WELL.
           [laughter]

   - ERICA, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
          MEDIUM WELL.
    - YEAH! THANK YOU, BABY.
       - YOU'RE WELCOME.
          - I LOVE IT.
   YOU GUYS KNOW YOUR STEAKS.

        OKAY. ALL RIGHT,
   GENTLEMEN, NEXT QUESTION.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
 I KNOW INSIDE EVERY GROWN MAN
        IS A LITTLE BOY,

       BECAUSE MY HUSBAND
     BECOMES A SIX-YEAR-OLD
      WHENEVER HE BLANKS.
             JASON.

   - I BECOME A SIX-YEAR-OLD
         WHEN WE FIGHT.
            - YEAH.
 - AND I GET ANNOYED REAL EASY,
      LIKE A LITTLE KID--
    THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.

            - OKAY.
   WHAT'D YOU SAY, CHRISTINA?
       WHEN YOU GET SICK!
       - YEAH, THAT TOO.

           [laughter]
        YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
         both: COME ON!
            - BRADY.

 - WHEN I GET SICK. DEFINITELY.
      - WHEN YOU GET SICK?
HOW DO YOU ACT WHEN YOU'RE SICK?
     - I LIKE TO BE RUBBED
  AND PAMPERED WHEN I'M SICK.

            - YEAH?
      - YEAH, DEFINITELY.

    WHAT'D YOU SAY, LEANDRA?
      WHEN YOU GET ANGRY.
         - YOUR TEMPER.
          - OH. DAMN.

  - ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA GO
TO OUR NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
          IF YOUR WIFE
    WERE TO DRESS UP AS YOU
         FOR HALLOWEEN,

   WHAT DID SHE SAY WOULD BE
      THE ESSENTIAL PIECE
        OF HER COSTUME?
             BRADY.

             - WOW.
      MAYBE WORK CLOTHES--
 RIPPED JEANS, RIPPED T-SHIRT,
             DIRTY.

           [laughter]
          - ALL RIGHT.
     ERICA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        HIS DIRTY JEANS.
        YES, ABSOLUTELY!

      - THAT'S RIGHT. YAY!
            - YEAH!
     - THAT'S RIGHT, BABY.
         - ABSOLUTELY.
             OKAY.
            [laughs]

         LANCE, IF SHE
    WERE TO DRESS UP AS YOU,
         WHAT WOULD BE
      THE ESSENTIAL PIECE
        OF THE COSTUME?

     - [sighs] SWEETHEART,
       I WOULD HAVE TO GO
        WITH MY SHIRT--
         I DON'T KNOW.
         - YOUR SHIRT?
           - MM-HMM.

            - OKAY.
    LEANDRA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
          YOUR PANTS.
        - HIS PANTS! OH.

         OH, MAN. OKAY.
     JASON, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         - I WOULD SAY
   MY CHUCK TAYLOR SNEAKERS.

 - YOUR CHUCK TAYLOR SNEAKERS.
NOW, WHAT ABOUT THESE SNEAKERS?
       - THEY'RE CLASSIC.
    I WEAR 'EM ALL THE TIME.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   CHRISTINA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       - THAT'S MY PICK.
   - YOUR AVIATOR SUNGLASSES.
        - YOUR SNEAKERS
      AIN'T GONNA FIT ME!
           [laughter]

            COME ON!
- BUT I'M WEARING 'EM RIGHT NOW.
      - YOU GOT BIG FEET!
      - YOU GOT BIG FEET.
             - NO!
 - THEY'RE SMALLER THAN YOURS!

     - YOU CAN'T SAY--WHAT?
         - YOU'LL FIT.
   - YOU CAN'T SAY YOUR WIFE
         HAS BIG FEET.
           - COME ON!
  - SHE SAYS YOU GOT BIG FEET.

      THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.
     - I GET IT. I GET IT.
        I'M SORRY, BABY.
 - NO, SHE SAID YOUR AVIATORS,
   'CAUSE YOU'RE A ROCK STAR.

   OKAY, COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 40 POINTS!
      PLEASE STICK AROUND,

BECAUSE OUR FINAL BONUS QUESTION
         IS COMING UP,
        AND IT IS WORTH
        UP TO 30 POINTS.
      SO ANYBODY CAN WIN.
         DON'T GO AWAY.

     [cheers and applause]
        BRADY AND ERICA,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 40 POINTS.

  BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.
  IT'S WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
  THIS CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.
     ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
  MY HUSBAND COULD DEFINITELY
        SHOW MY LAST EX
  A THING OR TWO ABOUT BLANK,

    BUT BETWEEN YOU AND ME,
     MY LAST EX COULD GIVE
   MY HUSBAND A FEW POINTERS
           ON BLANK.

             LANCE.
        - I CAN GIVE HIM
    A FEW POINTERS ABOUT...
           [laughter]

          THE BEDROOM
     AND HANDLING BUSINESS.
           - MM-HMM.
            - AND...
         HE CAN GIVE ME
        SOME POINTERS--

     NAH, HE CAN'T GIVE ME
     POINTERS ON ANYTHING.
      - OKAY. SO, LEANDRA,
     WHAT ARE YOUR ANSWERS?
 MAKING LOVE AND DOING LAUNDRY.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.

   - THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BABY.
 - BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO WIN.
         I'M SO SORRY.
          OKAY, JASON.

        - I CAN GIVE HIM
      POINTERS ON RESPECT,
     'CAUSE HE DOESN'T KNOW
     HOW TO RESPECT WOMEN,
       AND HE CAN GIVE ME
      POINTERS ON NOTHING.

    - ON NOTHING. ALL RIGHT.
   - HE'S GOT NOTHING ON ME.
       - WHAT'D YOU SAY,
           CHRISTINA?
       ON BEING SENSITIVE
          AND NOTHING.

       YOU'RE HALF RIGHT.
         SO THAT MEANS,
      COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
        CONGRATULATIONS.
      YOU ARE THE WINNER.

            - WHOO!
       - CONGRATULATIONS.
      BUT WE'D LOVE TO SEE
          YOUR ANSWER.
       - I WOULD'VE SAID
       BEING A GENTLEMAN.

      - BEING A GENTLEMAN.
- AND I DON'T NEED ANY--NOTHING.
            - OKAY.
     ERICA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   BEING SENSITIVE, NOTHING.

        CONGRATULATIONS.
       YOU'RE THE WINNER!
           both: YAY!

        WHILE PATROLLING
      IN HIS POLICE CAR--
  AS LONG AS HE DIDN'T PROPOSE
    WHILE ARRESTING A PERP.

    MEET LORENZO AND NISHA.
          AND FINALLY,
     WHEN THEY GOT MARRIED,
  HE VOWED TO LOVE, HONOR, AND
  THROW OUT HIS BACK FOR HER.

  HERE'S CHARLIE AND HEATHER.

         HI, EVERYBODY.
         HI, HI, HELLO!

              HI!
           YOU MOVED.
       HELLO, AND WELCOME
      TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
    ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE SENT
      THE WIVES BACKSTAGE

      SO WE CAN ASK THEIR
    HUSBANDS SOME QUESTIONS.
         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.
         - HERE WE GO.

          IN HER ROLE
    AS COITAL CONTORTIONIST,
     DOES YOUR WIFE PREFER
   HER LEGS FLAT ON THE BED,
   UP IN THE AIR, OR WRAPPED
 AROUND ONE OF YOUR BODY PARTS?

            CHARLIE?
    - OH, RIGHT OFF THE BAT,
      SHERRI, YOU GET ME.
           - [laughs]

    - I THINK THEM ARE FLAT.
    - OKAY, SO SHE LIKES HER
     LEGS FLAT ON THAT BED.
     - IT'S TYPICAL, YEAH.

     - OKAY, IT'S TYPICAL.
    LORENZO WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - SHE LIKE IT UP IN THE AIR.
    - UP IN THE AIR? VERY--
  YOU ARE VERY CONFIDENT, SIR.

             - YES.
    - YES, SO UP IN THE AIR.
        - UP IN THE AIR.

  - YEAH, I MEAN, WE PUT THE--
           YOU KNOW,
     THE MARQUIS DE SADE--
       WE MAKE HIM BLUSH.

             OKAY.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
  HALF OF BEING A GOOD HUSBAND
          IS LEARNING
    WHEN TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

      SO TELL ME, WHAT DID
      YOU SAY TO YOUR WIFE
   THAT TAUGHT YOU THAT FIRST
     LESSON IN SHUTTING UP?
            LORENZO?

            - MM...
       WHEN I CALLED ONE
        OF HER OUTFITS--
      IT WAS A BAD OUTFIT.

      SHE HAD SOME CLOTHES
         I DIDN'T LIKE,
   HER BREASTS WERE SHOWING,
         AND I TOLD HER
       I DIDN'T LIKE IT,

    'CAUSE SHE LIKE WEARING
CLOTHES WITH HER BREAST SHOWING,
  AND I DIDN'T LIKE IT AND SHE
  TOLD ME IT WAS HER CLOTHES.
            - YEAH.
             - YES.

       - SO YOU TOLD HER
     THAT WAS A BAD OUTFIT?
 - OKAY. MIKE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- WELL, I DON'T REALLY--I SPEAK
    WITH MY EYES SOMETIMES,

     SO LIKE A LOT OF TIMES
    IF I LIKE NOTICE, SAY--
     IF I LOOK AT HER HAIR,
         AND SHE THINKS
    THAT'S IT'S OUT OF PLACE

    OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
           SHE'LL GET
   SELF-CONSCIOUS ABOUT THAT.
            - OKAY.
            CHARLIE.

    - WELL I'M A BIG EATER,
       SO I'D SAY NEVER,
  NEVER DIS A DINNER BECAUSE..
            - YEAH.
   - YOU SAY IT'S A BAD ONE,

      YOU AIN'T GETTING IT
   FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.
            [laughs]
            - OKAY,
     SO IF YOU SAY ANYTHING

       ABOUT HER COOKING,
           FORGET IT.
            - YEAH.
 YEAH, BE NICE IN THE KITCHEN.
   - BE NICE IN THE KITCHEN.
      GOT YOU, ALL RIGHT.

    THINGS I CAN'T SAY. AH.
        - OH, THOSE ARE
      THE THINGS WE WANT.

    - WELL, YOU KNOW, A LOT
      OF DIFFERENT THINGS.

            THOUGH.

           [laughter]

         - OH, MY GOD.
       ALL OF THE ABOVE?

   LET'S SEE...WRAPPED AROUND
     ONE OF HIS BODY PARTS.
      - WRAPPED AROUND ONE
    OF HIS BODY PARTS, OKAY.

     HIS BODY PARTS. YEAH.
     [cheers and applause]
        - SO CONFIDENT,

    ERIKA, I DO HAVE TO SAY
    I'M LOVING THE TATTOOS.
          - THANK YOU.
       - WHAT'S THE STORY
       WITH THE TATTOOS?

       - WELL, I GREW UP

    CALLED THE WU-TANG CLAN,

         SO I HAVE ALL
      THE BEES ON MY ARM,
    REPRESENTING MY FRIENDS
        AND I, YOU KNOW.
    - OKAY, AND WHAT DOES IT
     SAY ACROSS YOUR CHEST?

  - IT SAYS "FAR FROM BUMBLE."
    'CAUSE I'M A KILLER BEE,
       NOT A BUMBLE BEE.
       - OH! I LIKE THAT.
     THAT'S VERY SEXY, HUH?

            - YEAH.
   - YEAH. HE LIKES IT, YEAH.
   OKAY, HERE WE GO, LADIES.
  HALF OF BEING A GOOD HUSBAND

          IS LEARNING
    WHEN TO SHUT YOUR MOUTH.
  SO WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
      WAS THE FIRST THING
         HE SAID TO YOU

        THAT TAUGHT HIM
   THE LESSON IN SHUTTING UP.
             NISHA?
     - THAT HE DIDN'T LIKE
         THE FURNITURE

    I PICKED FOR THE HOUSE.
 - HE DIDN'T LIKE THE FURNITURE
   YOU PICKED FOR THE HOUSE?
     WHAT KIND OF FURNITURE
          DO YOU LIKE?

     - I LIKE NICE, SLEEK,
       MODERN FURNITURE.
    - AND WHAT DOES HE LIKE?
         - INEXPENSIVE.
           [laughter]

         - YEAH, THAT'S
    A BIG DIFFERENCE. YEAH.
             THAT'S
       A BIG DIFFERENCE.
         WELL, LORENZO,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

         - HER OUTFITS
    I ALWAYS COMPLAIN ABOUT.
       - HE SAYS HE DON'T
       LIKE YOUR OUTFIT.
         - THAT'S TRUE.
THERE'S ALWAYS TOO MUCH OF THIS.

           - SEE? OH.
           - HE SAYS
   IT'S TOO MUCH RIGHT HERE.
        - ALL THE TIME.
- HE LIKES IT JUST FOR HIMSELF.

        HE DOESN'T LIKE
      THE WHOLE WORLD TO--
           - EXACTLY.
            - YEAH.
       OH, WERE YOU GONNA
   WEAR SOME CLEAVAGE TODAY?

       - NO, NO, NO, NO.
      NOT FOR THE WORLD--
  - OH, I MEAN, IT LOOKS GOOD.
          - THANK YOU.

         - HERE WE GO.
             ERIKA?
        - I DON'T KNOW.
          LET'S SEE...
     WE DON'T REALLY ARGUE
    OR FIGHT ABOUT ANYTHING.

        SO I'D SAY MAYBE
    A COMMENT ABOUT MY HAIR.
       - DO YOU GET UPSET
          WHEN HE SAYS
   SOMETHING ABOUT YOUR HAIR?
   - WELL, I HAVE CURLY HAIR,

    AND IT TAKES A LONG TIME
      TO BLOW IT STRAIGHT.
        SO IF HE'S LIKE,
"OH, YOU HAVE SOME FLY-ALWAYS--"
   LIKE I SPENT A LOT OF TIME
 SITTING THERE, IRONING IT OUT.

      - YEAH, 'CAUSE WHAT
    HE'S SUPPOSED TO SAY IS,
   "THAT LOOKS GREAT, HONEY."
       - YEAH, LIE TO ME.
     - OKAY, NOT FLY-AWAYS.

           LET'S SEE.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - I SAID I--
        LIKE IF I KNOW--
          - IF I DON'T
      LIKE HER HAIR, YEAH.

             - OH!
  - IF I DON'T LIKE HER HAIR.
           [applause]
       I WOULD NEVER MAKE
      A COMMENT ABOUT IT.

- YOU NEVER--HE SAID IF HE GIVES
  YOU THE LOOK WITH HIS EYES.
            - YEAH.
        - THEN YOU KNOW.
         - HE LOOKS UP.
           I'M LIKE,

"WHAT YOU LOOKING UP THERE FOR?
      I'M DOWN HERE, BRO?"
            - OKAY.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, HEATHER?
      - WELL, HE'S PRETTY
       NICE ALL THE TIME,

     SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW
  WHAT NEGATIVE HE WOULD SAY.
       PROBABLY SOMETHING
       ABOUT MY CLOTHES.
            - OKAY.
   CHARLIE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - I LIKE TO EAT.
  - IF HE DISSES YOUR DINNER.
            - TRUE.
           [laughter]
     - ARE YOU A GOOD COOK?

          - OH, YEAH.
 - BUT IF HE SAYS ANYTHING BAD?
          - BANNED IT.
        - OH, FORGET IT.
       ALL RIGHT. THIS IS
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    MY WIFE COULDN'T MAKE IT
 THROUGH THE DAY WITHOUT BLANK.
             ERIKA?

            - UM...
           [mutters]
    OH, GOD, WITHOUT MUSIC.
       - YOU LIKE MUSIC,
             YEAH.

    - ALL MUSIC, LIKE I HAVE
  TO LISTEN TO MUSIC, OR ELSE,
     YOU KNOW--IT'S BORING.
 I NEED A SOUNDTRACK TO MY DAY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    MIKE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

   - THAT'S TRUE, BUT I SAID
      AFFECTION BECAUSE--
      - HE SAID AFFECTION.
       SPECIFICALLY SEX.
           [laughter]

        - SPECIFICALLY.
        - OKAY, HEATHER.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - PROBABLY DEFINITELY
         THE COMPUTER.

    I'M ALWAYS GLUED TO IT,
    CHECKING EVERYTHING OUT,
             SO...
           - CHARLIE.
        - I'M AN IDIOT.

       - HE SAID COFFEE.
        - IS THAT TRUE?
       - I LIKE MY COFFEE
           TOO BUT...
          - ALL RIGHT.
     NISHA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - I GUESS I WOULD SAY
         THE TELEVISION
   BECAUSE THAT'S MY FAVORITE
  THING TO DO, IS TO COME HOME
         AND PLOP DOWN
  IN FRONT OF THE TELEVISION.

          BUT I GUESS
    THAT'S NOT WHAT HE SAID.
           [laughter]
           - LORENZO,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

         - AH, SWEETS.
           - SWEETS.
        - SHE CAN'T LIVE
      WITHOUT HER SWEETS.
  - OH, THAT WAS ANOTHER ONE.

         - YEAH, 'CAUSE
     APPARENTLY YOU CAN'T--
     YOU GUYS CAN'T EVEN BE
      IN THE BED TOGETHER
      WITHOUT YOU GETTING
          YOUR SWEETS.

            - YEAH.
            [laugh]
        - BUT WHY DO YOU
        NEED YOUR SWEETS
  WHEN YOU GOT YOUR GUMMY BEAR
   SITTING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU?

   - I DO, THEY JUST FULFILL
   A DIFFERENT KIND OF SWEET.
           [laughter]
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.

           [applause]
        MIKE AND ERIKA,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 10 POINTS.

         HOW SOON AFTER
         THE FIRST KISS

     DO YOU FIND HIS NEEDLE
       IN YOUR HAYSTACK?
    TWO MINUTES, TEN MINUTES
        OR HALF AN HOUR?
            HEATHER?

      - UMM...10 MINUTES.
 - HE GETS RIGHT TO THE POINT.
    - HE GETS TO THE POINT.
  WE HAVE OTHER THINGS TO DO.

             - OH!
          OKAY, NISHA.
  - I'M GONNA SAY TWO MINUTES
            'CAUSE--
    AND THAT'S MOSTLY ON ME.

      I LIKE TO GET TO IT.
  - OKAY, AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I'M GONNA DEFINITELY SAY
          10 MINUTES.

         - TEN MINUTES.
   - YOU KNOW, NOT TOO SOON,
 NOT TOO, YOU KNOW, THAT I'M--
           LET'S GO!
      10 MINUTES IS GOOD.

            - OKAY.
    LADIES, NEXT QUESTION--
     COMPLETE THIS PHRASE.
      IF THERE'S ONE THING
        OF MY HUSBAND'S

        IT'S HIS BLANK.
             NISHA?
      - UM, I'M GONNA SAY
           HIS HEAD.

 HE SAYS THAT WAS HIS NICKNAME
   WHEN HE WAS YOUNGER, SO...
        - WHAT, "HEAD"?
         - YEAH, HEAD.
       HE HAD A BIG HEAD.

       - OH, SO EVERYBODY
        CALLED HIM HEAD?
             - YES.
            - OKAY.
      AND WHAT ABOUT YOU,
             ERIKA?

- I DEFINITELY SAY HIS HEAD TOO.
        - HIS HEAD TOO!
        - YEAH, I MEAN,
    I DON'T THINK IT'S HUGE,
        BUT HIS FRIENDS
        THINK OTHERWISE.

      - YEAH, SO HIS HEAD.
          - OH, YEAH.
        - OKAY, HEATHER?
     - I THINK HIS STOMACH
      SEEMS TO BE GROWING

     AND GROWING THE LONGER
      WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER.
        - IT SEEMS TO BE
      GROWING AND GROWING.
            - YEAH.
- I DIDN'T REALLY SEE A STOMACH.

        - WELL, HE TRIED
   TO SLIM DOWN FOR THE SHOW.
        - OH, HOW SWEET
          CHARLIE IS.

             ERIKA?
       - OH, MY GOODNESS.
       SEE, THIS WOULD BE
      A FIGHT TO THE DEATH

     THAT WOULD BE VISIBLE
       FROM OUTER SPACE,
          RIGHT HERE.
             UM...
            [sighs]

      I'D HAVE TO SAY HIM.
       HE'S A SCHMOOZER.
   HE'S GOOD WITH THE PEOPLE.
           OH, YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            HEATHER?

       - DEFINITELY HIM.
    HE HAS A CHARM ABOUT HIM
 THAT EVERYONE SEEMS DRAWN TO,
       SO DEFINITELY HIM.
       - YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
             NISHA?

     - I'D SAY LORENZO TOO.
    EVERYBODY LOVES LORENZO.
    ALL MY FRIENDS MEET HIM
       FOR THE FIRST TIME
          AND FALL IN
      LOVE WITH HIM, SO...

     - SO IT'D BE LORENZO.
WOULD BE THE MEN FOR PRESIDENT.
             - YES.
   - OKAY. ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
        SOMETIMES A MAN
         IS REFERRED TO

         AS A STEAK AND
     POTATOES KIND OF GUY.
  BUT IF YOU HAD TO ADAPT THAT
     NAME FOR YOUR HUSBAND
  USING HIS FAVORITE MAIN DISH
  AND HIS FAVORITE SIDE DISH,

     HE WOULD BE A WHAT AND
       WHAT KIND OF GUY?
            HEATHER?
        - I DON'T THINK
       I WOULD ADAPT IT.

   HE'S A STEAK AND POTATOES
       SORT OF BOY, SO...
- HE'S A STEAK AND POTATOES GUY?
          OKAY, NISHA?
   - THESE DON'T GO TOGETHER,

     BUT HE'S A LASAGNA AND
      MASHED POTATOES GUY.
         - OKAY, ERIKA?
- YEAH, I'D SAY LIKE CHORIZO...
           - CHORIZO.
          - YOU KNOW.

       HIS MEXICAN SIDE.
      AND POTATOES, SURE.
    - CHORIZO AND POTATOES.
           - WHY NOT.
   - OKAY. ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.

        WHEN WE RETURN,
      WE ARE GOING TO SEE
       IF THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
