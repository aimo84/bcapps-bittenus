          - ALL RIGHT.
    THE GUYS ARE BACK TO SEE
       IF THEY CAN MATCH
     THEIR WIVES' ANSWERS.
  LET'S SEE HOW WELL THEY DO.

           ALL RIGHT.
     HERE'S WHERE WE STAND.
 COUPLE NUMBER 3, YOU GUYS ARE
  IN THE LEAD WITH 10 POINTS.
        COUPLE NUMBER 2,
YOU ARE FOLLOWING WITH 5 POINTS.

    YOU ARE IN SECOND PLACE.
     AND LORENZO AND NISHA,
       YOU HAVE 0 POINTS,
     BUT YOU STILL CAN TURN
           IT AROUND.

           ALL RIGHT.
       HERE IS THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10 POINT QUESTIONS.
    GENTLEMEN, WHEN YOU AND
    YOUR WIFE START NECKING

          IN THE BARN,
 HOW SOON AFTER THE FIRST KISS
     DID SHE SAY SHE FINDS
  YOUR NEEDLE IN HER HAYSTACK?
     2 MINUTES, 10 MINUTES
   OR HALF AN HOUR? CHARLIE?

           [laughter]
        - OH! LET US IN
          ON THE JOKE.
        WHAT'S GOING ON?

     - FUNNY YOU MENTIONED
           ONE BARN.
    WE'RE BOTH FROM A FARM.
   - OH, WOW! HOW MANY BARNS
     ARE YOU DEALING WITH?

         - OH, WE'RE--
  WE BOTH LIKE FARMING, SO...
   SO YOU HIT THE SPOT THERE.
     AND AS FAR AS MINUTES,
         I'M GONNA GO--

        WHAT? WAS IT 2?
       - OKAY. 2 MINUTES,
YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH 2 MINUTES?
       - YEAH, 2 MINUTES.

        - DO YOU REALLY
     DO IT IN THE HAYSTACK?
           [laughter]
        - I BETTER WAIT
     AND SEE WHAT SHE SAID.

        - OH, LET'S SEE.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - I SAID 10 MINUTES.
         - 10 MINUTES.
            - AUGH!

    - YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT,
            THOUGH.
   - YOU FEEL IT'S 10 MINUTES
     OR 2 MINUTES, CHARLIE?
    - I MEAN, USUALLY IT'S--
      YOU'RE IN THE BARN,

     YOU GET TO THE CHASE,
         SO IT AIN'T NO
          10 MINUTES.
       - LIKE TEN MINUTES
          IS TOO LONG.

            - YEAH.
           TOO LONG.
     - ALL RIGHT, LORENZO.
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
       - WE NEVER DONE IT
        IN A BARN, BUT..

           [laughter]
         BUT I'M GOING
       WITH TWO MINUTES.
          - 2 MINUTES?
             - YES.

      - ALL RIGHT, NISHA.
          TWO MINUTES.
  both: YEAH, WE GOT A POINT.
     [cheers and applause]
            - YEAH.

           [laughter]
       CUT TO THE CHASE.
  OKAY, MIKE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - WELL, THERE'S NOT MANY BARNS
 IN BAY RIDGE, BUT I'M GONNA--

        SO I'M GONNA SAY
        LIKE 10 MINUTES.
         - 10 MINUTES.
      - EVEN THOUGH LIKE,
    YOU KNOW, WE DO LIKE TO

    JUMP INTO IT SOMETIMES,
            I THINK.
   WE TEAR EACH OTHER APART.
         BUT, YOU KNOW,
  I THINK WHEN WE'RE NECKING,

            I THINK
       WHEN WE'RE REALLY
  GETTING PASSIONATE ABOUT IT,
   I'D SAY ABOUT 10 MINUTES.
      - ABOUT 10 MINUTES.
            - YEAH.

    - ALL RIGHT. ERIKA, WHAT
    DID YOU SAY? 10 MINUTES.
     [cheers and applause]
          - VERY GOOD.

          - ALL RIGHT.
    HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
     COMPLETE THIS PHRASE?
     IF THERE IS ONE THING
        OF MY HUSBAND'S

   THAT WOULD BE VISIBLE FROM
          OUTER SPACE,
        IT'S HIS BLANK.
            LORENZO?

     - GOT BE THE STOMACH.
     GOT TO BE THE STOMACH.
  HOPEFULLY IT'S THE STOMACH.
     - YOU SAID, "HOPEFULLY
       IT'S THE STOMACH."

      - HOPEFULLY SHE SAID
       THE STOMACH, YEAH.
         - OKAY, NISHA,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        - NO, YOUR HEAD.
          - YOUR HEAD.

             - AWW!
- BECAUSE THAT WAS YOUR NICKNAME
  WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER, YES?
         - YES, IT WAS.
    - MIKE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - I MEAN, I'VE GOT
        A SIZE 13 SHOE.
    SO I WOULD SAY MY FEET,
           HONESTLY.
          - YOUR FEET.
     - THEY'RE PRETTY BIG.

         - OKAY, ERIKA,
  WHAT DID YOU SAY? YOUR HEAD.
    - EVERYBODY SAYS YOU CAN
  SEE YOUR HEAD, THE BIG HEAD.
      - [speaking Spanish]
            - YEAH.

     - OKAY, I'M A FATHEAD.
       NOW I'M A FATHEAD.
         YOU SEE THAT?
           ALL RIGHT.
       - OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
    CHARLIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - OH, SHERRI. THIS IS
   A HARD ONE. I DON'T KNOW.
     EH, SHE LIKES MY LEGS,
 SO I'M JUST GOING TO SAY LEGS.
    - YOU CAN SEE YOUR LEGS
       FROM OUTER SPACE?

          - WHO KNOWS?
              I...
           [laughter]
      - DON'T GIVE UP YET.
    ERIKA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - SAID STOMACH.
           - STOMACH.
     - YOU WENT ON A DIET.
           [laughter]

   - SHE SAID YOU LOST WEIGHT
   JUST FOR <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
      ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS.
  THIS IS YOUR NEXT QUESTION.

  IT IS 2024 AND YOU AND YOUR
 WIFE ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT
    AGAINST ONE AND ANOTHER.
     WHO DID YOUR WIFE SAY
   IS MORE LIKELY TO CAPTURE

   THE HEARTS OF THE AMERICAN
  PEOPLE AND WIN THE ELECTION?
             MIKE?
   - I'M GONNA SAY ME BECAUSE
    I DEFINITELY LIKE HAVE--

    LIKE I'M SO OVER THE TOP
        A LOT OF TIMES,
  AND I THINK I CAN, YOU KNOW,
      RILE THE PEOPLE UP.
     - MORE SO THAN ERIKA?

      - YEAH, I THINK SO.
            - YEAH.
      - I THINK SO, YEAH.
         - OKAY, ERIKA.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   HE WOULD! YOU WOULD, MIKE.

      - I'M AN EGOMANIAC.
    SO...YEAH, I GOT AN EGO.
    - YOU'RE THE EGOMANIAC?
        - I GOT AN EGO.
            - OKAY.
    CHARLIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

         - HANDS DOWN,

     [cheers and applause]

           - LORENZO,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I'M A PEOPLE PERSON
  SO I THINK IT'S GONNA BE ME,
         BECAUSE I'M--
  SHE MORE ON THE QUIET SIDE.

   WHEN WE'RE AROUND A LOT OF
 PEOPLE, SHE IS THE QUIET ONE.
   EXCEPT AROUND HER FAMILY--
    SHE CANNOT STOP TALKING.
           - OH, THEN
       YOU START TALKING?

  - NOW YOU CAN STOP TALKING.
          - YOU WOULD.
     [cheers and applause]
   - ALL RIGHT, THERE YOU GO.
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.

        OH, MY GOODNESS!
        MIKE AND ERIKA,
       YOU'RE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 30 POINTS.
       LORENZO AND NISHA,

        WITH 20 POINTS.
          IT'S OKAY--
      CHARLIE AND HEATHER,

         BUT IT'S OKAY

       BECAUSE IT IS TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.
 THIS IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
  THIS CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.
          HERE WE GO.

      GENTLEMEN, SOMETIMES
      A MAN IS REFERRED TO
    AS A STEAK AND POTATOES
          KIND OF GUY,
 BUT IF YOUR WIFE HAD TO ADAPT
       THAT NAME FOR YOU,

 USING YOUR FAVORITE MAIN DISH
  AND YOUR FAVORITE SIDE DISH,
 SHE WOULD SAY YOU WERE A WHAT
     AND WHAT KIND OF GUY?
            CHARLIE?
            - UH...

       SHE KNOWS I LIKE--
         LIKE MY BEEF.
 YOU GOT THE COWS IN THE BARN.
    I'M GONNA EAT THE BEEF.
    I'M GONNA WITH HAMBURGER
         AND POTATOES.

   - HAMBURGER AND POTATOES.
   WHAT DID YOU SAY, HEATHER?
     - STEAK AND POTATOES.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
    OKAY, YOU GOT 30 POINTS,

  SO YOU'RE TIED FOR THE LEAD.
            LORENZO,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     - I'M A PASTA MAN SO--

     [cheers and applause]
    - ALL RIGHT, SO YOU GUYS
        ARE IN THE LEAD.
     MIKE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - THIS IS TOUGH
      BECAUSE I LIKE FOOD.
    I MEAN, YOU KNOW, AND...

       HOW ARE YOU GUYS?
            - GOOD.

       - YOU GOT SO MUCH
        ENERGY TONIGHT.
           - DO THIS!
      - OKAY, WELL, LOOK.

          WE HAVE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE
         SO WE CAN ASK
      YOU SOME QUESTIONS.
 WE'RE GONNA GET RIGHT INTO IT.
         ARE YOU READY?

            - YEAH.
            - READY.
            - OKAY.
          HERE WE GO.
  IF THERE WAS A REALITY SHOW
      ABOUT YOUR SEX LIFE,

    WOULD IT BE ON CINEMAX,
        COMEDY CENTRAL,
       OR ANIMAL PLANET?
              JOE?

   - I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY--
    HAVE TO GO WITH CINEMAX.
           - CINEMAX?
        - YEAH, CINEMAX.
    YOU KNOW, NOT TOO CRAZY,
        BUT JUST ENOUGH.

         - JUST ENOUGH.
             STEVE?
       - CINEMAX AS WELL,
          BECAUSE, UH,
  I REMEMBER THE NICKNAME FOR
 CINEMAX WHEN I WAS GROWING UP,

     WHICH WAS "SKINEMAX."
          - ALL RIGHT.
   - SO I'LL GO WITH CINEMAX.

   - SO IS IT STILL SKINEMAX
       AT YOUR HOUSEHOLD?
          - OH, YEAH.
            - OKAY.
              JIM?

        - I'M DEFINITELY
       GONNA SAY CINEMAX.
    UH, WE HAVE A LOT OF FUN
        IN THE BEDROOM,
        AND WE ALSO HAVE
    OUR ANIMALISTIC NEEDS...

            - YEAH.
      - AND, UH, DESIRES,
       SO WE INCORPORATE
         BOTH OF THEM,
      AND I THINK WE HAVE
   A GOOD BALANCE AT CINEMAX.

         - AT CINEMAX.
  OKAY, FELLAS. NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
  "IF THERE'S EVER A WORLDWIDE
       SHORTAGE OF BLANK,

            "MY WIFE
    WOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY,
      "BECAUSE, TRUST ME,
        SHE'S GOT ENOUGH
      TO LAST A LIFETIME."

             STEVE?
    - UH, DEFINITELY SHOES.
             SHOES.
   OUR--OUR LITTLE APARTMENT

      IS ABOUT 40% TO 50%
           HER SHOES.
            - OKAY.
      - DEFINITELY SHOES.
             - JIM?

        - UNFORTUNATELY,
        IT'S SHOES ALSO.
    WE JUST MOVED LAST WEEK,
  AND WE ACTUALLY LOOKED INTO
   GETTING A CLOSET ORGANIZER

         FOR HER SHOES,
        AND WE COUNTED,
     AND THERE'S LITERALLY
      105 PAIRS OF SHOES.
            - WHOO!

  - SO THAT'S--THAT'S INSANE.
          - 105 PAIRS.
     I'M IN HEAVEN. REALLY.
              WOW.
              JOE?

          - OF IDEAS.
          - OF IDEAS?
   - TO DO AROUND THE HOUSE.
    BECAUSE SHE'S GOT ENOUGH
    TO KEEP ME BUSY FOREVER.

       - OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION,
           HUSBANDS.
     IF YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW

      HAD HER HEART SET ON
    GETTING PLASTIC SURGERY
      AND DEMANDED TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THOUGHT SHE SHOULD FIX,
    WHAT WOULD YOU TELL HER
          TO GET DONE?

              JIM?
            - GOSH.
      A PHYSICAL FEATURE?

    HOPE SHE'S NOT WATCHING.
   BUT I WOULD SAY PROBABLY--
     - OH, SHE'S WATCHING.
          DON'T WORRY.

      - OF COURSE SHE IS.
          I WOULD SAY
       PROBABLY HER EYES.
     WHEN MY MOTHER-IN-LAW
       SMILES AND LAUGHS,

    IT LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE
      HER EYES ARE CLOSED,
   SO I THINK SHE MIGHT WANT
  TO GET THEM A LITTLE WIDER.
          - OH, OKAY.

     YEAH, SHE'S WATCHING,
     'CAUSE SHE'S SO PROUD
       OF HER SON-IN-LAW.
              JOE?

    - IF--MY MOTHER-IN-LAW,
       SHE LOVES THE SUN.
  SHE WILL SIT OUT IN THE SUN

       MY MOTHER-IN-LAW,

          LOVE JENNY,

 LADIES, IF THERE WAS A REALITY
   SHOW ABOUT YOUR SEX LIFE,
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
 IT WOULD BE ON COMEDY CENTRAL,

   CINEMAX, OR ANIMAL PLANET?
            LAUREN?
  - I'M GONNA GO WITH CINEMAX.

           - CINEMAX?
      - YEAH, DEFINITELY.
     UM, NOT ANIMAL PLANET,
        AND CINEMAX, UH,

          WE HAVE SOME
       INTERESTING THINGS
          THAT I THINK
  THEY WOULD FIND INTERESTING.
      - OH, WHAT WOULD WE
       FIND INTERESTING?

      - UM, I DON'T KNOW.
           - I MEAN,
   'CAUSE IT'S GOT YOU GOING.
  "WE'VE GOT SOME INTERESTING
    THINGS THAT WE WOULD..."

     I'M LIKE, "WHAT IS IT
THAT MAKES YOU MOVE LIKE THAT?"
     WHAT DID YOU SAY, JOE?
            CINEMAX!

            - YEAH!
            - YEAH.
           ALL RIGHT.

           JENNIFER.
             - YES.
    UM, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
        COMEDY CENTRAL.

       - COMEDY CENTRAL?
   - WELL, NOT BECAUSE OF ANY
  FUNNY THINGS IN PARTICULAR,
    BUT HE--HE'S JUST FUNNY.
       HE MAKES ME LAUGH.

    HE KEEPS ME ON MY TOES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    STEVE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           - CINEMAX.

        - CINEMAX? WHY?
     - OUR SEX LIFE, HONEY.
             - OH.
  - NOT THE REST OF THE STUFF.
             - NO!

             - UGH.
             - OH!
    - OKAY, SO DO YOU STILL
      SAY COMEDY CENTRAL,
      OR WOULD YOU SAY...

    - WELL, NOW I DEFINITELY
      SAY COMEDY CENTRAL.
         YOU'RE IN FOR
     COMEDY CENTRAL, HONEY.
          - ALL RIGHT.

        - OKAY, CHERRYL,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - I'D DEFINITELY SAY CINEMAX.
           - CINEMAX?
      WHAT'D YOU SAY, JIM?

- 'CAUSE IT'S JUST LIKE A PORN.
             - OH!
            CINEMAX.
       - I SAID CINEMAX.
       - JUST LIKE PORN.

         - DID YOU SAY,
      "JUST LIKE A PORN"?
        - TASTEFUL PORN.
       - A TASTEFUL PORN.
          - TASTEFUL.
      IT'S A GOOD BALANCE.

     - I LIKE THIS COUPLE.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

  "IF THERE'S EVER A WORLDWIDE
       SHORTAGE OF BLANK,
       "MY WIFE WOULD NOT
         HAVE TO WORRY,
      "BECAUSE, TRUST ME,

        SHE'S GOT ENOUGH
      TO LAST A LIFETIME."
           JENNIFER?
   - I'M A HUGE SHOE SHOPPER,
       AND I LOVE SHOES,

        SO IF THERE WAS
      A SHORTAGE OF SHOES,
   THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM,
   BECAUSE I DEFINITELY HAVE
   ENOUGH TO LAST A LIFETIME.

    - STEVE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            - SHOES!

             - YAY!
           - [laughs]
            - WHOO!
           - CHERRYL,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY
          SHOES ALSO.
  I'M JUST LIKE IMELDA MARCOS.
      105 PAIRS OF SHOES.

       - 105 PAIRS? WOW.
           ALL RIGHT.
      WHAT'D YOU SAY, JIM?
        - I SAID SHOES.
            - SHOES!

          AND, LAUREN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - I'M GONNA GO WITH JEWELRY.
           - JEWELRY.
      - I LIKE MY JEWELRY.
          DEFINITELY.

            - OKAY.
      JOE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - UGH. I SAID IDEAS,
PROJECTS AROUND THE HOUSE TO DO.
    - ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
       - I'M OFTEN DOING.

      - ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.
IF YOUR MOTHER HAD HER HEART SET
   ON GETTING PLASTIC SURGERY
 AND DEMANDED TO KNOW WHAT YOUR
HUSBAND THOUGHT SHE SHOULD FIX,

        WHAT DID HE SAY
   HE'D TELL HER TO GET DONE?
            CHERRYL?
  - HER STOMACH? I DON'T KNOW.
         - HER STOMACH?
             WHOO!

 AND HOW'S YOUR MOM GONNA FEEL
       WHEN YOU SAY THAT?
             - I...
        I HAVE NO IDEA.
 I'LL SEND HER FLOWERS BEFORE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
          - WELL, JIM,
      THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
     YOU GONNA SEND FLOWERS
     TO YOUR MOTHER-IN-LAW?

          - I'M OKAY.
    SHE'S IN THE DOG HOUSE.
            NOT ME.
          I SAID EYES.
     THEY ALWAYS DISAPPEAR
        WHEN SHE LAUGHS.

         - SHE'S ASIAN.
      WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?
       - I KNOW, SO MAYBE
      SHE WANTS 'EM WIDER.
     - YEAH, BOTH YOU GUYS
        ARE IN TROUBLE.

        GET MOM THE EYES
        AND THE STOMACH.
            LAUREN?
  - I'M GONNA GO WITH "BUTT,"

       BECAUSE MY MOTHER
         AND I BOTH SAY
 THAT IF WE COULD DO ANYTHING,
 WE'D LIKE TO ENHANCE OUR BUTTS
      A LITTLE BIT, SO...

      - OKAY, SO THE BUTT.
  - THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA SAY.
          - OKAY, JOE,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

  - I WENT WITH SOMETHING ODD,
    BUT I SAID "COLOR TONE."
        YOUR MOM ALWAYS
        LIKES TO BE TAN!
       - I KNEW YOU WERE
         GONNA DO THAT.

     I KNEW IT. I KNEW IT.
      - IF SHE COULD DO IT
ALL YEAR ROUND, SHE WOULD DO IT.
            - YEAH.
      - SHE'D BE THE TAN.

      ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- UM, WELL, THIS IS GONNA SOUND
        A LITTLE CRAZY,
   BUT MY MOTHER CANNOT KEEP
   A SECRET TO SAVE HER LIFE,

 SO I THINK HE'S GONNA GET SOME
 KIND OF MOUTH PLASTIC SURGERY.
          SO SHE WO--
SO SHE CAN KEEP HER MOUTH SHUT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
         I DON'T KNOW.

 MAYBE YOUR HUSBAND SHOULD GET
  SOME MOUTH PLASTIC SURGERY.
    LET'S SEE WHAT HE SAID.
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, STEVE?
        - HER BEAUTIFUL
      BUT PROMINENT NOSE.

           - OH! OH.
              OH.
     I LIKE MY MOM'S NOSE.
           - AS DO I.
            - OKAY.

   - BEAUTIFUL AND PROMINENT.
             - AW.
       - MUCH LIKE YOURS.
    - MINE'S NOT PROMINENT.

   - STEVE, IT WAS SOMEWHERE
    YOU SHOULD HAVE STOPPED
     WITH THE, YOU KNOW...
           ALL RIGHT.
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.

     OKAY, JIM AND CHERRYL,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH TEN POINTS.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN

      - NICE--LONG ENOUGH,
        BUT NOT TOO LONG.

     - ALL RIGHT. CHERRYL,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

         A SCUBA TANK!
             - AAH!
  - I SAID YOU WERE EFFICIENT.
           YOU ARE!
       - YEAH, BUT STILL,
    I LIKE TO BE DOWN THERE,

     YOU KNOW, MAKING SURE
    EVERYTHING'S ALL RIGHT.
        - A SCUBA TANK.
  YEAH, IT'S LIKE 90 MINUTES.
           [laughter]

          - ALL RIGHT,
    NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
       THERE IS NO DOUBT
  THAT YOUR WIFE CONSIDERS YOU
        TO BE "THE ONE."

       BUT LET'S FACE IT,
    YOU'RE ALSO LAST IN LINE
     ON HER LIST OF LOVERS.
       SO HOW MANY OTHERS

          DID SHE SAY
        CAME BEFORE YOU?
             STEVE.
    - WELL, SHE'S NEVER SAID
         ANY, ACTUALLY.

     SO I'M GONNA SAY ZERO.
    - GONNA SAY ZERO. OKAY.
        - [mouths words]
       - SO THE QUESTION
 THAT I HAVE FOR YOU, STEVE...

            - YEAH?
- DO YOU BELIEVE IN SANTA CLAUS?
           [laughter]
       [cheers, applause]

          - YES, I DO.
         - YES, HE DOES.
           - YES, I DO.
      - JENNIFER, MY LOVE,
        WHAT DID YOU SAY?

          - UGH, DO I
     REALLY HAVE TO ANSWER?
      - YOU GOTTA ANSWER,
           JENNIFER.
           both: 12!

       [laughter, cheers]
             - 12?
     - JIM, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

- WE'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT WHAT'S
  IN OUR PAST IS IN OUR PAST.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  - SO WE HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY
    COUNTED WITH EACH OTHER.
            - OKAY.

    - SO I WOULD HAVE TO DO
  A GUESSTIMATE HERE, AND I...
          I DON'T KNOW
   IF I'M BEING CONSERVATIVE
       OR A LITTLE TOO--
       TOO ON EDGE HERE,

         BUT I'M GONNA GO
  WITH A BALLPARK NUMBER OF--
      GOING OFF OF 12, 15?
         - YOU SAID 15?
             - 15.

           - CHERRYL,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
              20!
             - AH!

        WELL, IT'S MORE
     THAN I THOUGHT, BUT...
         both: [laugh]
       - ALL RIGHT, JOE.

         - I GOTTA SAY,
     ONE OF THE BEST THINGS
   ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE SO FAR
 IS THAT WE DISCUSS EVERYTHING.
   SO I KNOW THIS IS A TOPIC
  WE'VE DEFINITELY DISCUSSED,

     SO I'M IN BIG TROUBLE
     IF I GET THIS WRONG.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    - BUT I'M GONNA SAY SIX.
          - SIX, OKAY.
WELL, WHAT DID YOU SAY, LAUREN?

   - HE MAKES THE NUMBER SIX.
             - OH!
       OH, THAT'S RIGHT!
        I MADE SIX! OH!
         SUBTRACT ONE!

            AH, MAN!
           - [laughs]
      - THIS NEXT QUESTION
IS FROM OUR FASHIONABLE FRIENDS

           AT MACY'S.
     EVERYONE LOVES TO MAKE
      A FASHION STATEMENT.
      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
   YOUR WIFE SAYS SHE PUTS ON

     WHEN SHE REALLY WANTS
     TO MAKE THE STATEMENT
      "I LOOK HOT TODAY"?
              JIM.

  - IT'S DEFINITELY HER SHOES.
     SHE'LL EITHER PUT ON--
       WELL, LIKE I SAID,
     SHE'S GOT 105 OF 'EM.
     SO SHE'S GOT EVERYTHING
  FROM THE ONES OVER THE KNEES

     TO HER "POWER SHOES,"
     THAT SHE CALLS THEM.
       - OKAY, CAN YOU BE
  A LITTLE BIT MORE SPECIFIC?
         - I WOULD SAY
       THE GOLD-TIP ONES.

        THE GOLD HEELS.
       - WHAT'D YOU SAY,
            CHERRYL?
            SHE SAID
     THE TALL SUEDE BOOTS.

      - AH! I DO LIKE THEM
           THE BEST.
   - YOU LIKE THOSE THE BEST.
      WHAT'D YOU SAY, JOE?

    - I WOULD SAY HER HEELS.
          SPECIFICALLY
   HER PATENT LEATHER HEELS.
            THE ONES
      SHE'S GOT ON TODAY.

            - OKAY!
      - YEAH, DEFINITELY.
     SHE LOOKS GOOD IN 'EM.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    LAUREN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       THE LEATHER HEELS!

            THE ONES
      SHE'S GOT ON TODAY!
       [cheers, applause]
             STEVE.
      - HER FAVORITE PAIR

    OF TALL STILETTO HEELS.
    - OKAY. WHAT'D YOU SAY,
           JENNIFER?
         - STILETTOS!
     - THE STILETTOS! YEAH

          - YOU RULE!
     - ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.

        MY HUSBAND BLANK

              JIM?
    - ONE THAT WOULD MAKE ME

           - CHERRYL,

             YEAH.

    LIKE TO DOWNLOAD AN APP
    THAT WOULD MAKE ME STOP
    TAPPING OR MAKING NOISE

   ANY TIME I'M MAKING NOISE
        OR ANNOYING HER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   WHAT DID YOU SAY, LAUREN?
     SHE SAID STOP TAPPING
     WHEN SHE WANTS QUIET.

      YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
        BUT YOU'RE TIED.
          YOU'RE TIED

      ENTIRE POSTER BOARD?

             DUKE?
     - EASY, POSTER BOARD.
     SHE MOANS, SHE GROANS.
   IT SOUNDS LIKE ELEPHANTS,

         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

   I MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THERE,
       BUT IN HIGH SCHOOL
      I FEEL LIKE MY WIFE
       WAS A TOTAL BLANK.
             COREY?
        - MAYBE A NERD.

   - YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR WIFE
       WAS A TOTAL NERD?
    - A LITTLE NERD, MAYBE.
        - DOES SHE HAVE
    ANY OF THOSE QUALITIES?

           - NOT NOW.
            - YEAH?
      SAM, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - UM, SHE ALWAYS LIKES
           TO TELL ME

          HOW POPULAR
    SHE WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.
            - OKAY.
             DUKE?
          - A TOMBOY.
       SHE'S DEFINITELY--

        - OH, SHE WOULD
     BE A DEFINITE TOMBOY?
  - SHE'S DEFINITELY A TOMBOY,
    THAT'S KIND OF THE WAY--
  WHERE I'D GO WITH THAT ONE.

      - ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
 OUR FINAL QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
    I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT IT
 WAS CUTE THAT I SHARE MY NAME
      WITH A SPANISH WINE,

 IF YOU HAD TO RENAME YOUR WIFE
   AFTER HER FAVORITE DRINK,
         WHAT WOULD HER

   - LET'S GO WITH CHAMPAGNE.

            - DUKE?
  - EASY PEASY, LEMON SQUEEZY.

       [audience laughs]
     SHE HAS HER OWN DRINK
        THAT SHE MAKES.
          SHE CALLS IT
  "STACY'S SUNFIRE SURPRISE."

      - STACY'S SUNFIRE--
         WHAT IS THAT--
     - IT'S CRYSTAL LIGHT,

    - THAT'S WHEN WE FILL UP
     THE--SAYING THE PAPER.

      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS

     AND NOW IT'S YOUR TURN
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.
      HERE WE GO, LADIES.

   IF YOU HUSBAND WROTE DOWN
    ALL THE SOUNDS YOU MAKE
     DURING A NIGHT OF SEX,
        WOULD IT FILL...
  A POST-IT, A PIECE OF PAPER,

   OR AN ENTIRE POSTER BOARD?
             STACY?
   - AN ENTIRE POSTER BOARD.
   - WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

      - UM, 'CAUSE WE HAVE
 SOME VERY LONG, LOUD EVENINGS.
           [giggles]
   - AND I AM NOT SURPRISED.

         "SAM, OH, SAM,
         OH, SAM, SAM."
        WHAT'D YOU SAY,
           SAM, SAM?
   - I SAID A PIECE OF PAPER.
      - A PIECE OF PAPER.

         - THERE'S ONE!
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

   "I MAY NOT HAVE BEEN THERE
      BUT IN HIGH SCHOOL,
    I FEEL LIKE MY WIFE WAS
        A TOTAL BLANK."
            TONYIA?

       - I THINK HE SAID
            A BITCH.
         [audience ohs]
       - WHY WOULD COREY
        HAVE SAID THAT?

     WHAT DO YOU THINK HE--
        - 'CAUSE THAT'S
    WHAT HE'D SAY I AM NOW.
       - IS THAT IN YOUR
  WILD LOVE-MAKING TALK HERE?

             - NO.
            - UH-UH.
          - I SAID...
           - A NERD.

       - YOU WERE A NERD
        IN HIGH SCHOOL.
             - AW!
          - [chuckles]
          - ALL RIGHT.
        WELL, GO AHEAD,

       THE BITCH IS BACK.
           I LOVE IT.
         THERE YOU GO.
          - [laughing]
          - [giggles]
           - A NERD?

        - OKAY, RACHEL,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I WOULD ALWAYS SAY THAT
    I WAS THE FUNNIEST GIRL
       IN MY HIGH SCHOOL.

    I THINK I WAS EVEN THAT
        IN THE YEARBOOK.
       SO I WOULD SAY HE
   WOULD SAY I'M A JOKESTER?
     - SAM, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

          - I THOUGHT
    ABOUT THAT AS A CONCEPT,
          AND INSTEAD
    WENT WITH POPULAR GIRL.
      - MOST POPULAR GIRL.
         - I WAS VERY--

     IT WAS A SMALL SCHOOL.
             - AH.
     - SO IT WAS VERY EASY
         TO BE POPULAR.
            - OKAY.
      - WE CAN STILL KISS.

        - THERE YOU GO.
         OH, I LOVE IT.
           [applause]
       NOW CRAZY STACY...
             - YES?
       - WHAT DO YOU SAY?

    - HE WOULD'VE MAYBE SAID
          CLASS CLOWN?
    - DUKE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         - AW, TOMBOY.
          - A TOMBOY.

         - OH, I GUESS
        I WAS THAT TOO.
            - YEAH.
           - SORT OF.
      - ALL RIGHT LADIES,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.

  I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS CUTE
      THAT I SHARE MY NAME
     WITH THE SPANISH WINE,
            SHERRY.
        IF YOUR HUSBAND
       HAD TO RENAME YOU

   AFTER YOUR FAVORITE DRINK,
      WHAT DID HE SAY YOUR
    NEW FIRST NAME WOULD BE?
            RACHEL,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

            - UH...
              GIN?
       - SO YOUR NAME...

           I GOT YOU.
             STACY,
   WHAT WOULD YOU BE CALLED?

    - UM, I'M THINKING RUM?
             - OH.
             - RUM.
   NOW WHY WOULD YOU SAY RUM?
   - BECAUSE RUMPELSTILTSKIN.
   WE HAVE A JOKE ABOUT THAT.

          - ALL RIGHT.
             DUKE.
       - RUMPLESTILTSKINS
   WITH A LITTLE YAHOO, RUM.
            - YEAH.

    START WITH YOU, TONYIA.
         - REGINA KING.

     - HE LOVES HER A LOT.
 BUT I DON'T THINK SHE'S CUTE.
     AND HIS MOTHER DOESN'T
   THINK SHE'S CUTE, EITHER.
          - [laughing]

         OKAY, RACHEL?
 - A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T AGREE.
     I DON'T THINK GISELE'S

       OUR NEXT QUESTION.
      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
  YOU LOVE ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND
       THAT EVERYONE ELSE
         CANNOT STAND?

            RACHEL?
     - HE LIKES TO PESTER.
          HE LIKES TO,
     LIKE, POKE AT THINGS.
        AND SOMETIMES I
  DON'T FIND IT THAT ANNOYING,

           BUT, LIKE,
    HE LIKES TO, LIKE, GO--
    HE'LL GO UP TO SOMEBODY
AND, LIKE, UNTIE THEIR SHOELACE.
            - STACY?
 - THAT HE FARTS ALL THE TIME?

    AND I THINK IT'S FUNNY.

            REALLY?
           - HE DOES.
         - WELL, HELL,

            - YEAH.
          - LUCKY YOU.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
   HERE IS A BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE, LADIES.

  IF THERE'S ONE THING I MISS
         ABOUT THE SEX
       IN OUR EARLY DAYS,
        IT'S THE BLANK.
  BUT SINCE THEN, WE'VE GOTTEN
    SO MUCH BETTER AT BLANK.

             STACY?
        - FREQUENCY, AND
   DOING IT IN PUBLIC PLACES.
            - OKAY.
          - [giggles]

        - WHAT'S, LIKE,
   THE WILDEST PUBLIC PLACE?
     - I'D ALWAYS WANTED TO
  GO TO A SCIENTOLOGY BUILDING
  AND SEE, LIKE, ALL THE WEIRD
   STUFF THAT GOES ON THERE.

      SO WE WENT IN THERE,
  AND WE TOOK OUR LITTLE TEST,
          AND I SAID,
    "MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM
     IN ABOUT 30 SECONDS,"
          AND HE DID.

         - OH, MY GOD.
   AND THEY DIDN'T CATCH YOU?
            - NOPE.
        - YOU ARE GOOD.
          - THANK YOU.
    - AND YOU ESCAPED, TOO.

          - [giggles]
      - ALL RIGHT, TONYIA?
       - ONE THING I MISS
    ABOUT THE EARLY DAYS IS
       HAVING ORGASMS...
          - ALL RIGHT.

         - FREQUENTLY.
      AND SINCE THEN WE'VE
GOTTEN BETTER AT COMMUNICATION.
        - COMMUNICATION.
           - MM-HMM.

            - OKAY.
            RACHEL?
  - ONE THING, THE FREQUENCY.
        - THE FREQUENCY.
          - THE SECOND
      IS TRYING NEW MOVES?

 - TRYING NEW STUFF, ALL RIGHT.
            - YEAH.
           - LADIES,
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.

    I HAVEN'T FOUND THE CANE
     OR THE SEEING EYE DOG,
  BUT MY HUSBAND MUST BE BLIND

       BECAUSE HE THINKS
     BLANK IS A SEXY WOMAN.
             COREY?

         A PONY TO ME.

        - AND THAT IS...
       [audience laughs]
      SO TORI SPELLING HAS
  THE PONY LOOK, AND THAT'S--

            - YEAH.
   - DEPENDABLE AND SOOTHING.
           [laughter]
        - HOT CHOCOLATE!

          OKAY, THAT'S
       A BIG DIFFERENCE.
          - SERIOUSLY?
    - IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE,
TEA IS DEPENDABLE AND SOOTHING,

          HE'S GOT YOU
         HOT CHOCOLATE!

- SERIOUSLY, WHERE YOU COMING--
           - [laughs]

           OR ARE YOU
      STILL WITH THE TEA?
        - I'M STILL WITH
     THE TEA, I DON'T KNOW.

          - ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT ABOUT YOU, SIMONE?
        - I HAVE TO SAY
        WHAT KATE SAID.

       I HAVE TO SAY TEA.
     - YOU HAVE TO SAY TEA?
      - I HAVE TO SAY TEA.
          I AM VERY...

         - DEPENDABLE?
         - DEPENDABLE.
     AND SOOTHING, SHERRI.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    CHRIS, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        HE SAID COFFEE.

             - OH!
       - FULL OF ENERGY.
            - WHAT?
     - LET'S GO ON, LADIES.

   HERE'S THE NEXT QUESTION.
  ASIDE FROM YOUR WEDDING DAY,
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
 WAS THE BEST DAY OF HIS LIFE?

             KATIE?
     - THE DAY HE PROPOSED.
     - THE DAY HE PROPOSED?
   ALL RIGHT, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

        THE ENGAGEMENT.
            - YAAY!
           [giggles]

           - SIMONE?
        - KATIE'S A GIRL
      AFTER MY HEART, BOY,
       'CAUSE I WOULD SAY
  THE SAME THING, ENGAGEMENT.

          - ALL RIGHT,
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, CHRIS?
      - VACATION IN VEGAS.
             - AAW!
         - SIMONE, WHAT
       HAPPENED IN VEGAS?

           [laughter]
 WHAT HAPPENED IN VEGAS THAT IT
 WAS THE BEST DAY OF HIS LIFE?
  - I DON'T KNOW, PUSHING HIS
 MOTHER AROUND IN A WHEELCHAIR?

            - WHAT?
        - I DON'T KNOW!
            - CHRIS!
    WHAT HAPPENED IN VEGAS?
- THAT WASN'T THE SAME VACATION.

   - WHAT WAS GREAT IN VEGAS?
        - I DON'T KNOW,
     I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT
    THAT VACATION IN VEGAS.

        WE'VE BEEN THERE
          A FEW TIMES.
         - OH, NO, NOT
        THAT VEGAS ONE.
            - YEAH.

           - JESSICA?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
     THE BIRTH OF OUR SON.
    - THE BIRTH OF YOUR SON?
         - ABSOLUTELY.

          - ALL RIGHT,
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, STEVEN?
      - BIRTH OF OUR SON.
      - BIRTH OF THE SON.
       - YOU BETTER HAVE!

    - MWAH! LOVE YOU, BABY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       LADIES, LET'S PLAY
    THE GAME <i>JEOPARDY!</i> STYLE.

          I GAVE YOUR
       HUSBAND THE ANSWER
         AND HE HAD TO
     TELL ME THE QUESTION.
         SO THE ANSWER
        WAS "YOUR BUTT."

          SO ACCORDING
        TO YOUR HUSBAND,
     THE QUESTION WOULD BE,
         WHAT IS BLANK?

            SIMONE?
        "WHAT IS ROUND?"
    OOH, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

       ALL RIGHT, CHRIS?
      WHAT IS YOUR HEART.
            - HEART.
         OH, MY HEART.

       - IT'S THE SHAPE.
           - [laughs]
  I HAVE A HEART-SHAPED BUTT.
            - YEAH!

     YEAH, HE SAID YOU HAVE
      A HEART-SHAPED BUTT.
            - SORRY.
          - OH, WELL.
   - THAT'S VERY, VERY SWEET.

        I THINK...YEAH.
           [laughter]
      - I THOUGHT IT WAS.
           - IT WAS.

     - ALL RIGHT, JESSICA?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
        "WHAT IS JUICY."
       - "WHAT IS JUICY?"
  - HE'S ALWAYS SQUEEZING IT.

     - HE LIKES TO SQUEEZE?
 - AND I THINK IT'S JUICY, YES.
    - STEVEN IS A SQUEEZER?
       - I BELIEVE--YUP.
        - WHAT IS JUICY.

   - SO I THINK HE WOULD SAY
        "WHAT IS JUICY?"
      - ALL RIGHT, STEVEN.
  - I SQUEEZE IT A LOT BECAUSE
  IT'S MY FAVORITE BODY PART.

     - OH, WHAT'D YOU PUT?
      - THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
    - MY FAVORITE BODY PART.
             - OH.
        - AND WHAT WOULD
        YOU SAY, KATIE?

       - "WHAT IS SEXY?"
     - TOM, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        - I SAID ALSO MY
   FAVORITE BODY PART, SO...

      NOT TOO GOOD, CLOSE.
        BUT IT IS SEXY,
        SO THAT'S GREAT.
         - IT IS SEXY.

        ALL RIGHT, LET'S
      SEE WHERE WE STAND.
   OKAY, STEVEN AND JESSICA,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH TEN POINTS.

       WHEN WE COME BACK
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,
  AND THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED.
          STAY TUNED.

        THE ENTHUSIASM.
         THIS IS GREAT.

      LADIES, YOUR HUSBAND

  BUT JUST HOW MANY COMEBACKS
 HAS HE HAD IN A SINGLE NIGHT?
        [audience oohs]

            JESSICA?

          HERE WE GO,
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
      WHICH OF THESE WOMEN
     KNEW YOUR HUSBAND BEST
   DURING HIS COLLEGE YEARS?

         THE LIBRARIAN,
   THE COOK AT THE CAFETERIA,
       OR THE SALES LADY
      AT THE LIQUOR STORE?
             KATIE?

       - THAT'S EASY, THE
SALES LADY AT THE LIQUOR STORE.
            [laughs]
            - YEAH?
             - YES.

      - A LOT OF DRINKING
      DURING COLLEGE, HUH?
            - OKAY.
            SIMONE?

  - THE COOK IN THE CAFETERIA.
  - THE COOK IN THE CAFETERIA?

 - HE'S THE COOK OF THE FAMILY.
            - YEAH?
         - SO I HAVE TO
     STAY WITH THAT ANSWER.

   - YES, THAT'S A GOOD ONE.
           - JESSICA?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
     THE, UM, LIQUOR STORE.

- THE LADY AT THE LIQUOR STORE.
        BECAUSE STEVEN'S
   WORKED HARD OVER THE YEARS
  AND IN STUDYING I KNOW THAT
 HE LIKES TO TAKE THAT EDGE OFF

 AND NOTHING TAKES THE EDGE OFF
LIKE A NICE DRINK, A TALL GLASS.
      - LIKE A TALL GLASS.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.
          - ALL RIGHT.

 THIS NEXT QUESTION IS FROM OUR
 FASHIONABLE FRIENDS AT MACY'S.

       FASHION COLLECTION
       WOULD YOUR HUSBAND
       WANT TO SEE ON YOU

          WHILE YOU'RE
  STRUTTING DOWN THE CATWALK?

 - ALL RIGHT, I THINK WE CAN--
  - NOTHING FROM THE WARDROBE.
      - IF YOU WANNA WALK
  ON THAT CATWALK IN NOTHING,

    THEN THERE YOU GO, GIRL.
     [cheers and applause]
          YEAH! KATIE?

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
     A LITTLE BLACK DRESS.
    - A LITTLE BLACK DRESS?
             - YES.
          - ALL RIGHT.

    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION,
        IT IS TWO PARTS,
          EACH PART IS
        WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
 THE ONE FRIEND OF MY HUSBAND'S
      WHO IS SO ANNOYING,
   THAT I WOULD LOVE TO ISSUE

      A RESTRAINING ORDER
     AGAINST HIM IS BLANK,
    BUT THE ONE FRIEND OF MY
    HUSBAND'S WHO IS SO HOT,
     THAT I ALWAYS HAVE TO

     RESTRAIN MYSELF AROUND
           IS BLANK?
            JESSICA?
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH
      THE MOST ANNOYING--

     WAS IT MOST ANNOYING?
             - YES.
        - WOULD BE BERT.
            - BERT?

      - BECAUSE BERT JUST
    CARRIES ON AND ON AND ON
      AND HE NEVER LEAVES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    - SO THAT WOULD BE BERT.

         AND I RESTRAIN
         MYSELF FROM--
          WOW, THAT'S
       A TOUGH ONE, UM--
         - HIS NAME IS
       NOT ERNIE, IS IT?

     - NO, IT'S NOT ERNIE.
      - OKAY, JUST SAYIN'.
      - THERE'S A BERT BUT
     THERE ISN'T AN ERNIE.
            - OKAY.

 - UM, I'M GONNA GO WITH LUKE.
          - WITH LUKE?
       - LUKE IS A REALLY
         ATTRACTIVE GUY
         AND I'M GONNA
         GO WITH LUKE.

       SO I WOULD HAVE TO
   RESTRAIN MYSELF FROMUKE.
       - WITH LUKE, OKAY.
            - MM-HM.
            - KATIE?

      - DO I HAVE TO SAY?
  BECAUSE I DON'T--THERE'S NO
 FRIENDS OF HIS THAT I REALLY--
          - [chuckles]
 - THAT I DON'T LIKE, YOU KNOW?

      LIKE THERE'S NONE--
   I LIKE ALL OF HIS FRIENDS.

            - YEAH.
    - CAN I GO WITH NOBODY?
     - WE CAN GO WITH THAT.

          ABSOLUTELY.
            - OKAY.
          AND THEN...
        HIS FRIEND THAT
       IS SO HANDSOME...

        RYAN--OH, RYAN.
           - AND WHAT
       ABOUT YOU, SIMONE?
     - I AGREE WITH KATIE,
     I CAN'T SAY ANNOYING.

           UH, JUMBO,
     'CAUSE HE TALKS A LOT.
          SO I'M GONNA
