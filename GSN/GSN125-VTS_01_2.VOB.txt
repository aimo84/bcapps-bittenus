     So what I'm saying is,
      people like options.
      When you take GEICO,

 you can call them anytime you
    feel like saving money.
        It don't matter,
         day or night.
       Use your computer,
        your smartphone,
     your tablet, whatever.

         The point is,
       you have options.
      Oh, how convenient.
        Hey. Crab cakes,
    what are you looking at?

  GEICO. Fifteen minutes could
  save you fifteen percent or
     more on car insurance.
     A good line of stuff.
  The red chairs are in shape.

     Everybody's in order,
  let's see what we have here.
  Uh, Margaux won bonus money.
 Diane, you won $300.

And is your sister
here today?
                     She's here.
Friday, Mary,
these two ladies,

you had both had your hair
on braids.
                           Yes.
      And I noticed a woman with
      long hair on the audience,
     I think that's the sister
     but it's all flowing today.

                           Yes.
   If you haven't seen this
  hair you got to look at it,
it's not quite down to the floor
    but it's extraordinary.
            Anyway.

         That happens
    when you win the money.
                         Right.
Mary, are you ready to go
to battle in a while?
          I'm ready.
Charlie, we'll start
with you and Margaux

after I read these subjects
for you.
  Margaux, you won bonus money
    but you got to get some

We're gonna have
to wrap it up for today.

Margaux, the good news is
you've won some money
and a trip to Rio.
                           Yes.
But the bad news is we're not
gonna have you back again.
                   That's okay.

                  It was great.
You won $1,100 in bonus
money and a nice trip.
Thank you.
           Thank you very much.
Charlie, we'll see you
tomorrow at the same time.
             Yup.

Diane, you'll be back here.
You're on your way
still with $12,550.
It could be a lot more.

And, Mary, we'll meet you
here at the same lot.
        I will be here.

         Hey, thank you
        very, very much.

   Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.
It's always nice to be with you
        on The Pyramid.
   I hope you got a half hour
      to pull up a chair,

    sit down in the kitchen,
        the living room,
   or wherever your TV set is
  and join us and play along.
   I noticed my wife playing
    this game the other day.

 She goes like this, you know,
    she puts the blinders on
           and plays
and then, shouts at the screen.
      What are you doing?
      Do you ever do that?

      Put-- Go like this?
Well, I mean, do you watch
when you're playing along?
             Yeah.
Well, then you know
the answer.

      No, no I don't look.
  I shut my eyes and I listen.
        I go like this.
Or actually if I don't have
my contact lenses,

 and then I leave my glasses,
           so, I'm--
Then it's real easy.
    Hey! There's no problem.
That's all a blur.
Hey, you have the new player.

Janice, I don't want to do
anything with that last name.
I was trying it earlier
and I was doing very badly.
How do you pronounce it?
                        Molnar.

Molnar.
                           Yes.
Nice to have you here.
                     Thank you.
You're a student of what?
    Uh, Political Communication

        at the George Washington
                     University.
We will see how well
you communicate here, my dear,
        in a little bit
          in about...
                     I hope so.

         I don't know,
    30, 40 seconds from now.
    Uh, this gentlemen here
will be your partner
in the next round.

Nice man.
Mr. Charlie Siebert.
How are you sir?
         I'm very well.
  Molnar's name, a very famous
     Hungarian playwright.

         Ferenc Molnár.
Really?
   I read a play called "Liliom"
   on which they based Carousel.
       Isn't this boring?
Good God.

How much more do you know
about Molnár?
  That is as much as I know.
      He was once married
 to a famous actress named, uh,
        Lily something.
I'm sorry, I asked.

               That's it. Pass.
  Diane Copeland is with us.
Diane is counting
the money right now
rather than seeing
Mr. Molnár's credits.

How much have you won
so far?
         I believe it's $12,550.
Yeah, and you are
a junior high school teacher

and we welcome you here.
                     Thank you.
      The Winner's Circle
   is over here, good people.
    Uh, you pretty much know
      what that story is.

   Let's skip on to the game
 and we'll get a go at it here.
   We have Running On Empty,
      I'm Just Delightful,
      My Brother's Keeper,
         He's So Silly,

     Counting The Minutes,
         Pop, Pop, Pop.
      We'll play the 7-11
          in the game.
       And Mary Cadorette
    makes the first choice.

         Pop, Pop, Pop.
You, fell for that, huh?
   What do you think it was?
                          Um...
         You picked it
     and you didn't know?

                  Things they do
             with Rice Krispies.
         I don't know.
No, no, no.
Things that bubble
or have bubbles.

Sounds like a fun category.
That's why you picked it.
Ready and go.

 Oh, you toast with this.
                   A champagne.
Right.
 And Trevi is one of these.

                          Um...
Water spurts out of it.
     Oh, a, um, volcano, geyser.
No. Uh, it's a structure
and water comes out of it.

                    A fountain.
Right
And this makes the coffee
in the morning.
                    Percolator.
Right.

And this is
what you do to your driveway.
The black top is...
                      Pavement.
                Paved asphalts.
Another word for it is..

It's a small word.
                       A paint.
The asphalt or...
You-you--
The roads are made of...
                         Cover.

Pass.
Um...
                           Tar.
              Yes
(Dick)
Yeah. You got tar.

Uh, the fountain slowed you down
a little bit at the top.
Don't be discouraged
with that, Janice.
     [audience applauding]

        I will tell you
         by experience
that scores like that
happened all the time.
This is a goofy game.

You never know
what's gonna happen.
So don't get down on the dumps
over a slow start.
Charlie?
      My Brother's Keeper.

 Alright, describe these things
        that are saved.
 Things that are saved.
 Ready, go.

"Time"
or "Newsweek" are...

Uh-hmm.
And you write yourself
a little...

                     Note. Memo.
And when you give
your ticket at the theater,
he gives you back the...
                       Receipt.

                      Uh, stub.

That's...
                          Life.
Yes.
Uh, y-you buy this
from a little shop

when you go on a trip,
you bring back home a...
                      Souvenir.
Yes.
And, oh, I feel very good.
I have a lot of...

                        Energy.
And you read an--
In the newspaper.
You read...
                            Ad.

Alrighty, it's 6-4.

Gallons.
                           Yes.
                   And this is,

    and the water seeps through,
    you have a...

Leak.
                           Yes.

   The game is looking better
     by the moment, Janice.

  Diane, what would you like?

Okay.
Charlie, she's going

these things that are slow.

        [buzzer sounds]
Motion.
Sorry, buzzer beat you
to that one.

 It is 12-11.
     [audience applauding]
Janice, you started out
the game possibly being

three points behind, you're only
a point behind, so that's--
      It's getting better
         by the moment.
What would you like over here?
                       I'd like
   I'm Just Delightful, please.

Would you like to give
or receive?
              I'd like to give.
             Mary, she's going

That's it.
        [buzzer sounds]
It is permissible

          about that.

[audience applauding]

For anybody,
who joined us late, uh,
we've teased Diane
about the fact
that she has beautiful hair,

but her sister
has also beautiful hair
and four times as long.
You said, it's what,
calf length?

   It's about halfway between
    her knee and her ankle.
Well, we'll get her up here
when you win the $25,000--
No, I beg your pardon,
the $10,000.

I've already up
the ante here.
I'm so anxious
to see the hair.
I'm raising the money.
             I'm anxious to see
                     the dough.

            Oh, yeah,
            let's get the money,
then we'll worry
about the hairdo.
                       Exactly.

Now, wait a minute, I got to get
you out from behind all of this.
Please come over.
             Sorry.
You'll get dealt with

      the gentlemen behind here?
This is my very sweet
husband Steve.

Charlie did a good job.
                Yes, thank you.
              Nice. Nicely done.
              That's terrific.
Why did you decide
to cut your hair and she didn't?

     Just foolish, I guess.
No, but-- Now, you're gonna buy
your own hair.
             Yeah.

Right.
It looks terrific.
It's nice to have you.
   We'll be back in a second.
       Don't go away now.

Uh, Diane Copeland has just won
$10,000 as you undoubtedly saw.
She's partnered
with Mary Cadorette
and Mary's opening
a restaurant.

                          Yeah.
        How about that?
          Is it soon?
           Mid-March.
Really? What will it be -
Will it be called Mary's?

          Mary's Lamb.
Mary's Lamb.
You're only gonna serve lamb?
        No, it's sort of
        a play on words

    like Mary had a little--
   You know, when you grow up
       with a name Mary,
    everyone says that your
     either quite contrary

     or where's your lamb?
              So--
So that's gonna be it.
             Yeah.
Is this been
a lifelong dream

or something?
     Well, now when people say,
           "Where's your lamb?"
     I can say where it is?
Where is it?
        In Sherman Oaks.

In California
              Yes.
Much good luck with that.
           Thank you.
   Charlie, you're up on deck
      with Janice Molinar

who has won $1,100
in bonus money,
but you got to get
score money now, score money.
So here we go
with these subjects.

      We have Fill It Up,
        He Is The Boss,
     She Loves Him Anyway,
          Prey For Me,
  Check the spelling on that.

      Let There Be Light,
        Twist And Turn.
         The Mystery 7
    offers an Alaskan cruise
       this time around.

        A trip to Alaska
    if you come up with it.
    Uh, Let There Be Light.
      Let There Be Light.
           Northern lights, no.

         I-I assume
         that the Alaskan cruise
        isn't right this minute.
       I mean it could be
       a little chilly up there.

        The boat's not leaving.
       No, I don't think
      they can get the--
      Well, maybe they can't get
      the boat through,
      it's gonna be cold.

      These are things
      associated with a lamp.
            A lamp.

Yes.
And, uh, you pull down
the window...
                         Shade.

And this is what
Aladdin's lamp was made off.
                      A copper.
                         Brass.
That's it.

Sorry.
      I know what I did.
Baseball, base.
       Base, base, base.
          I'm sorry.
               Baseball, I said.

      I did the same thing
            you did,
    I said, "What was wrong
   with that? Oh, baseball."
                          Yeah.
  Kerosene was the last one,
          by the way.

          5 out of 7.
Diane, stand by.
And, Mary, please?
   Uh, She Loves Them Anyway.

                          Okay.
           Alright.
          She Loves Them Anyway.
     Describe these things
      that a husband does

       to annoy his wife.
Things a husband does

Your husband

         Diane Copeland
      right under the gun
           with, uh,
  her next to last visit here
   picked up another $10,000.

 Takes you up to $32,550.
                           Wow.
Now, tell me the truth.
  When you came here, did you
anticipate that size of winning?
                  No, I didn't.

    I just hoped that I wouldn't
          make a fool of myself.
         That was all I wanted.
You have not done that,
for sure,
     and you've accumulated
    a fair amount of money.

      Mary, we'll ask you
    to hang in for a second.
      We'll let the guys
      go first this time.
                          Okay.
          Uh, Charlie and James,
          if you will,

            study these subjects
            over here
         and we'll go after them
         together in a moment.
    We have The Envelope Please,

          I'm No Square,
          The Icing On The Cake,
                 Sea Hunt,
                 Bye Bye Birdie.

     Trivia question:
     Who is in "Bye Bye Birdie"?
                  Dick Van Dyke,
                   Chita Rivera,
        uh, Paul Lynde.

  I'm talking about the play.
Who was...
     Who was Conrad Birdie?

                  Dick Gautier.

            That was the movie.
    I'm talking about the play.
         Oh, the play.

                           Yeah.
    I'm older than you are.
Move- Moving on here.
      That's another game
         we're playing

      right at the moment.
      There's a Mystery 7
        in here, folks.
     If you get 7 out of 7,
    it's a trip to Jamaica.

                          Okay.
    Charlie, where do we go?
         Of Course Not.
Of Course Not
is the choice.
Describe these things
that are smooth.

Things that are smooth.
 Ready, go.
Uh, when you do this
with your razor.

                         Shave.
Yup.
And you go on an airplane,
you have a very nice...
                        Flight.
Uh-hmm.

And Michigan
or Huron are...
                         Lakes.

And, uh,

            Sherry.
              I'd never get it.

                       Alright.
      How would you have
         gotten that?
                Cooking. I guess
        I could've used cooking.
Cooking Sherry, might.
Yeah.
             Yeah.

         Crystal cream
   is another clue over here.
Mary, what would you like?
     The Icing On The Cake.
Uh, where are we?

             Okay.
This is the one who's gonna open
         a restaurant,
       so you should know
          about these.

        Fattening foods.
                       Oh, God.

It's like a mousse but...

Yes.

And, uh, a crème,
sort of pudding...
                        Mousse.
But crème--
                       Custard.
It's another kind

       Right, all the coral is.

         And this what you, um--
          Let me go another way.
                 This might be--
      How you go into the ground
              to dig out things.

            You're gonna mine--
                      A nickel.
       [buzzer sounds]
(Dick)
No. Go ahead.
                     I said it.
               And this is, um--

        Different kinds of, uh,
        string all put together.
         You catch fish with it.
         Um, all strings--
Twine, lines, ropes.
                  All together.

            You dip it in
            to get the fish out.
Net.
                         Right.
 And, uh, this is the thing that
 steers the boat, the little...

Rudder.
      And this is the big thing
      that the Titanic ran into,
                     the ice...
        [buzzer sounds]

             Berg.
Oh, I do it to myself.
         It's alright.
                      My fault.

      [audience cheering]
James, you're gonna have to calm
yourself down a little bit.
                          Okay.
You're--

     I should probably do that.
Your working
a little too hard at it
and you're babbling words
occasionally.
And usually that's an indication
    you're pent up too hard.

        So relax a bit.
   It will be easier for you.
             Diane?
                I think we'll go
            with Bye Bye Birdie.

            And a very short hit
            on the green.

A putt.
                         Right.
(Dick)
That's it!
                            Oh.

  We have as options up here,
           gentlemen,
      The Envelope Please
       and I'm No Square.
One of those
has a card behind it

      that says Mystery 7.
      It's good for a trip
          to Jamaica.
       And I'll tell you
         more about it

if it happens to be
your good fortune.
Where do we go?
      We hope it's James'
         good fortune.
         I'm No Square.
It is good fortune.

        That's the one.
                          Good.

                        Circle.

   Charlie, you keyed in on.
        You kept saying,
 "Well, this is the round place

where they keep the horses."
