  Oh, ho-ho, look what I did.
           I did it.

   I finally did it, Johnny.

                          (Mary)
                What did you do?

         I said it was

      So let's-- Let's do that.
 Change the sign.
I knew it would happen
one of these days

     and today was the day.
          I apologize.
  This is The $25,000 Pyramid.
 Small reduction in the money,
       but the same game.

         No not really
          but kind of.
          How are you?
                      I'm fine.
             $100,000 is harder.

No.
         Oh, I think so.
It's all in your mind.
             Okay.
We make you think--
    No, it's not in my mind
    that's why it's harder.

    We have a couple
    of new players today.
We're very happy to have
Linda Lindsey with us today.
What do you do, Linda?
                 I'm a teacher.

 But right now, I'm staying home
               with my new baby.
The new baby?
          (Audience)
              Aw.
   How old is the new baby?
                Two months old.

Well, you better stay home.
Two months.
Yes, you can't be
cleaning up around the house
by yourself yet.
                            No.

   This is your first child?
        No, it's our third boy.
Third-- No girls?
                      No girls.
   He was supposed to be Coleen,
           but he came out Jeff.

Well, there you go.
     Better luck next time.
      [audience laughing]

          Good luck.
                     Thank you.
Charlie, how are you, sir?
       That's happening
    more often these days.
    He's supposed to be Coleen
    but he came out Jeff,

    but that's another story.
    Anyway, congratulations.
    I'm fine, Dick. Thanks.
Moving on.

        jacks with dice?
      A rough neighborhood
     I grew up in, I guess.
         I don't know.
             The bouncing balls
                 gave it to me.

       It's a little rubber ball
       as I recall.
  You bounce the dice and then--
                   I don't know.
      In any rate, I was,
        I was distracted

by something else
and missed it,
but that's what you did, huh?
       Now, we all know
    about your background.

Not a burrito but a...

Yes.
And you wash with this.

                           Mint.
    Look at the bright side.
          What is it?
You were trailing
by a point.

And if they've gotten
all the answer,
they would have won anyway.
      And if they only--
      [audience laughing]

               You sure know how
            to cheer someone up.
    And if they only get 6,

 I don't want you dwell on it.
   That happens all the time.

                         (Mary)
                     I'm sorry.
        The odds are--
      Not too bad now.
      You got a five point lead.
  You'll never know what's gonna
  happen on the other side.

      Let's see what goes.
      Charlie, you want to give?
   Yes, shouldn't this be
   An Officer And A Gentlemen's?
      I beg your pardon?
                    Never mind.

           It doesn't make sense
             that way it is now.
       So it's just good.
  An Officer And A Gentleman.
You want it singular
and you're right.

(Mary)
Maybe it's a play on words.
      Well, I think it is,
     but then it can't be.
                 Oh, gentleman.
     It's a play on words,
       but it is indeed.

       This astute fellow
       has picked up
       and made us all
       look like boobs
       right here on television.

         That's wrong.
            For the first time.
                     That never,
           ever happened before.
                          (Mary)
                You mean someone
                 messed that up?

      [indistinct chatter]
    That is a slight error.
 It should have read gentlemen.
   Though, it doesn't affect
   the outcome of this thing.

     It's things associated
       with a policeman.
           A Police--
       With a policeman.

Uh-hmm.

And you're under...
                        Arrest.
And, uh, all the stuff
that they show on court,

to prove it is the...
                      Evidence.
Yes, and--
(Dick)
That's the 20 points
you need!

      [audience cheering]
They're going for $25,000.
     [audience applauding]

            WELCOME TO THE SHOW,
                   BARRY.
  NICE TO MEET YOU.
           ALL RIGHT, SO IT SAYS

    YOU ATTENDED JAMES F. MURRAY
           PUBLIC SCHOOL.
 HERE'S A PICTURE OF YOU, BARRY,
     WHEN YOU WERE AT SCHOOL.
 AW, HE WAS ADORABLE,
      WASN'T HE?

   DID YOU EVER TAKE THE GLASSES
    OFF AND BURN ANTS WITH THEM?
           [ LAUGHTER ]
               OH, THAT'S NICE.

 I GOT BETTER LOOKING
   AS I GOT OLDER.
          THE ONLY THING THIS IS
          MISSING IS A MUSTACHE,
          YOU KNOW THAT?
           [ LAUGHTER ]

                 AND YOU WERE
             REALLY SKINNY THEN.
I WAS REALLY SKINNY THEN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
        BARRY, PICK A CLASSMATE,
            AND LET'S PLAY.

OKAY. I THINK WE'RE GONNA
START OUT WITH JACOB.
             JACOB, COME ON OUT.
           YEAH. WHOO!

     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
     YEAH! YEAH!
       COME ON!

     YEAH. WHOO!
        ALL RIGHT, BARRY.
 IF AT ANY POINT DURING THE GAME
        IT GETS TOO TOUGH,

  IF THE PRESSURE GETS TOO HIGH
          AND YOU DECIDE
     YOU DON'T WANT TO ANSWER
             ANY MORE
     GRADE-SCHOOL QUESTIONS,

    YOU MAY DROP OUT OF SCHOOL
        AND TAKE THE MONEY
        THAT YOU HAVE WON
 UP TO THAT POINT HOME WITH YOU.
BUT WHEN YOU DROP OUT OF SCHOOL,
     YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME

      THAT YOU'RE GONNA LOOK
         INTO THE CAMERA
    AND TELL THE ENTIRE WORLD,
        "I AM NOT SMARTER
       THAN A 5th GRADER."

        ALL RIGHT, BARRY.
       LET'S PLAY THE GAME.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
  LET'S PICK YOUR FIRST SUBJECT.

WHY DON'T WE START OUT
WITH 1st GRADE SCIENCE?
        1st GRADE SCIENCE.
           FOR $1,000,
       HERE'S THE QUESTION.

  "GAS, MOLTEN METAL, OR ROCK?"
          YOUR CLASSMATE
    HAS LOCKED IN HIS ANSWER.
   HOW YOU FEELING ABOUT THIS?

I'M FEELING PRETTY GOOD
     ABOUT THIS.
I THINK JACOB KNOWS IT,
  BUT I ALSO THINK
  THAT I KNOW IT.

SO MY ANSWER IS "A," GAS.
      I AM GONNA
  LOCK IN MY ANSWER.
            ALL RIGHT.

     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
        OUT OF CURIOSITY,
    LET'S SEE WHAT JACOB SAID.
      SO YOU BOTH HAVE GAS.

           [ LAUGHTER ]
      AND YOU'RE BOTH RIGHT.
      YOU GOT $1,000, BARRY.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

           FOR $2,000,
      HERE IS YOUR QUESTION.
   "STEVEN HAS $100 IN PENNIES.
 HOW MANY PENNIES DOES HE HAVE?"

          I DON'T THINK
        YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
     ENOUGH FINGERS AND TOES
       FOR THIS ONE, BARRY.
           [ LAUGHTER ]

             OR HAIR.
              SORRY.
IT WAS LIKE A BIG BASEBALL
JUST WAITING TO BE --

      I HAD TO SWING AT IT.
     JACOB JUST LOCKED IN.
     WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
     I'M THINKING
THAT I MIGHT KNOW THIS ANSWER.

I THINK JACOB KNOWS IT.
  BUT I KNOW STEVEN,
AND STEVEN HAS 10,000 PENNIES.
  LOCK IN MY ANSWER.

            WOW. OKAY.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
       HOW ARE YOU AT MATH,
              JACOB?

                 PRETTY GOOD.
    LET'S SEE WHAT JACOB SAID.
  "STEVEN'S GOT $100 IN PENNIES.
 HOW MANY PENNIES DOES HE HAVE?"

          JACOB SAID...
        ...THE SAME THING
         YOU SAID, BARRY.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

        GUESS WHAT, BARRY.
         YOU GOT $2,000.
    THE BAD NEWS IS YOU GOT
    TO SAY GOODBYE TO JACOB.

JACOB, YOU'RE THE MAN.
  GOOD WORK, BUDDY.
     PICK ANOTHER CLASSMATE,
      AND LET'S CONTINUE ON.

       YOU'VE GOT $2,000.
   WE'RE PLAYING FOR $5,000.
YOU'VE GOT ALL YOUR CHEATS LEFT.

    YOU'VE GOT YOUR SAVE LEFT.
   AND YOU'VE GOT LOVELY LAURA
        HERE TO HELP YOU.
     WHAT'S YOUR
FAVORITE SUBJECT, LAURA?

             OKAY, WELL,
      NOT TO SOUND NARCISSISTIC,
        BUT I THINK ALL OF THEM.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT.

      YOU KNOW WHAT, BARRY?
        I DON'T EVEN KNOW
    WHAT "NARCISSISTIC" MEANS.
           [ LAUGHTER ]

   YOU'VE GOT $2,000, BARRY.

         "TRUE OR FALSE?
       A TYPICAL MALE MOOSE
  SHEDS ITS ANTLERS EVERY YEAR."
        LAURA HAS ALREADY
        LOCKED IN, BARRY.

          TRUE OR FALSE,
      YOU GOT A 50/50 SHOT.
    THAT'S RIGHT.
   YOU CAN WALK AWAY RIGHT NOW
           WITH $2,000.

    I'M GONNA USE
 MY FIRST CHEAT HERE.
              OKAY.
 AND I AM GOING TO
 PEEK AT HER PAPER.

      "A TYPICAL MALE MOOSE
  SHEDS ITS ANTLERS EVERY YEAR."
          LAURA SAID...
     FEELING GOOD
  ABOUT THIS, LAURA?

           [ LAUGHTER ]
       I LIKED
HER CONFIDENCE, THOUGH.
        UH...

I'M GONNA SAY THAT'S FALSE.
I AM GOING TO LOCK IN
     THAT ANSWER,
  AND I AM GOING TO
      SAY FALSE.

         YOU SAID FALSE.
            THE ANSWER
     TO "A TYPICAL MALE MOOSE
        SHEDS ITS ANTLERS
          EVERY YEAR" --

   THE ANSWER TO THAT, BARRY...
             IS TRUE,
   BUT THAT'S WHAT LAURA SAID.
         YOU GOT $5,000.

         HEY.
     THE BAD NEWS IS, BARRY,
       YOU BURNED YOUR PEEK
     AND YOU NEEDED YOUR SAVE
       TO STAY IN THE GAME.

         YOU'VE ONLY GOT
      ONE CHEAT LEFT, BARRY,
     AND WE'LL SEE HOW YOU DO
