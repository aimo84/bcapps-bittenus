  WHEN YOUR WIFE TAKES A TRIP
         TO "OH" TOWN,
      DO YOU ACCOMPANY HER
         THE WHOLE WAY
      OR DOES SHE GO SOLO
    FOR PART OF THE JOURNEY?

      SO WHY DOES MY WIFE
   EXPECT ME TO KNOW TO BLANK
    WITHOUT HER EVER SAYING
            A WORD?

   OKAY, THE WIVES ARE BACK,

  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.
         SO HERE WE GO.

  LADIES, WHEN YOU TAKE A TRIP
         TO "OH" TOWN,
    DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY HE
 ACCOMPANIES YOU THE WHOLE WAY
 OR DID HE JUST SAY YOU GO SOLO
    FOR PART OF THE JOURNEY?

           BRITTANY?
         - I WOULD SAY
          THAT HE SAID
 THAT HE ACCOMPANIES ME FOR...

      - HE ACCOMPANIES YOU
        THE ENTIRE WAY?
             - YES.
            - OKAY.
        HE'S A NURTURER.
   HE TAKES CARE OF YOU, HUH?

 - YES, HE IS. HE'S VERY NICE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   I LOVE THAT "HMM-HMM-HMM."
           [laughter]

          OKAY, KENNY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
         THE QUESTION.
        I REALLY DIDN'T.

     - HE SAID YOU GO SOLO
    FOR PART OF THE JOURNEY.
      - THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
           [laughter]

   - CHELSEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - UM, ACCOMPANIES ALL THE WAY.
      - HE ACCOMPANIES YOU
          ALL THE WAY.

     - HE TAKES CARE OF ME.
      I'M GONNA SAY THAT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    CHRIS, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      - I THINK THAT'S...

      - HE ACCOMPANIES YOU
          ALL THE WAY.
             - YAY!
             YEAH.

    - ALL RIGHT, STEPHANIE.
- I WOULD SAY HE ACCOMPANIES ME
         THE WHOLE WAY.
       HE ACCOMPANIES YOU

     WHAT'D YOU SAY, JOHN?
             YEAH.
         THE WHOLE WAY.
           - AWESOME.

            - OKAY.
  ALL RIGHT, SO WE'RE GONNA GO
     TO OUR NEXT QUESTION.
  LADIES, HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS STATEMENT?

 DO I LOOK LIKE A MIND READER?
 SO WHY DOES MY WIFE EXPECT ME
            TO KNOW
TO BLANK WITHOUT HER EVER SAYING
            A WORD?

            CHELSEY.
      - KNOW WHEN TO COOK?
    - TO KNOW WHEN TO COOK?

             OKAY,
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, CHRIS?
      - PICK UP AFTER HER.
    - TO PICK UP AFTER YOU.
            - WHAT?

       - I COULDN'T THINK
          OF ANYTHING.
       - I CAN'T EITHER.
          - STEPHANIE.
     - TO TAKE THE DOG OUT.
         OUR DOG LUIGI.

    WHAT DID YOU SAY, JOHN?
       - DO THE LAUNDRY.
             - OH.
          - [chuckles]

  - BRITTANY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - TO HELP ME IF I'M, LIKE,
  TRYING TO PICK SOMETHING UP
    OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
      AND I'M JUST, LIKE,

  I'M TRYING TO DO IT MYSELF,
      AND HE JUST WANTS ME
   TO SAY, "CAN YOU HELP ME,
PLEASE?" OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT HE SAID.

            - OKAY.
    KENNY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        - DO THE DISHES.
            - WHAT?
 - I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING
            EITHER.

 I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING.
   - WE BOTH GOT THE PROBLEM
       DOING THE DISHES.
           - I KNOW.

       - ALL RIGHT THEN.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
         NOW IT'S TIME
FOR A KNOCK-KNOCK JOKE, LADIES.

          KNOCK-KNOCK.
      wives: WHO'S THERE?
 - MY WIFE'S HOTTEST FRIEND IS?

            - GIGI.
[laughter, cheers and applause]
             - WOW.

              WOW.
           [laughter]
      - I LOVE STEPHANIE.
   SHE IS A STRAIGHT-SHOOTER.

  SHE'S LIKE, "I'M NOT PLAYING
       ANY GAMES. GIGI."
           [laughter]
         - AH, LOVE IT.

        - SO, STEPHANIE,
         YOU SAID GIGI.
    OKAY, YOU GOT TO TELL ME
          ABOUT GIGI.
      - SHE'S A HOT DOCTOR
        THAT I WORK WITH

        AT THE HOSPITAL,
      AND, LIKE, YOU KNOW,
 SOMETIMES EVERY NOW AND THEN,
LIKE, THE HOSPITAL WILL GO OUT,
    AND HE'LL BE LIKE, "OH,"
  YOU KNOW, "IS GIGI COMING?"

          I'M LIKE...
           [laughter]
            - WHAT?
      - I NEVER SAID THAT.

         YEAH, YOU DID,
   'CAUSE YOUR EARS ARE RED.
    I'M LOOKING AT YOUR EARS
           RIGHT NOW.

   AND YOUR EARS ARE GROWING.
           - [laughs]
     LIKE, I DON'T REMEMBER
       THAT CONVERSATION.

  - YEAH. AND SHE'S ACTUALLY--
        SHE'S GORGEOUS.
      SO, UM, YOU KNOW...
           BUT STILL.
       - SO YOU SAY GIGI.
        ALL RIGHT, JOHN,

         I GOT TO KNOW.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
             GIGI.
     [cheers and applause]

          - GOOD JOB.
 - THERE'S NOTHING MORE TO ADD.
           [laughter]

    - WHEN HE HELD UP GIGI,
       STEPHANIE'S LIKE,
      "I'M GONNA KILL YOU.
          I LOVE YOU."
           [laughter]

           BRITTANY.
        - I WOULD THINK
       THAT HE WOULD SAY
     MY HOTTEST FRIEND IS--
    JUST BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE

ALWAYS SAY THAT SHE'S SO PRETTY
   AND PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME,
   LIKE, "WHERE IS SHE FROM?"
     AND "SHE'S SO PRETTY"
      AND STUFF LIKE THAT,
   AND THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON

     SINCE I'VE KNOWN HER.
      THIS WOULD BE TRACI.
            - TRACI.
     - SO I WOULD SAY TRACI
         IF I WERE HIM.
     AND IT WOULD BE OKAY.

           [laughter]
         - WRONG AGAIN.
      - IT WOULD BE OKAY.

     - KENNY, IS IT TRACI?
          IT'S TRACI.
            - WHOO!

             YEAH.
      OH, SHE'S SO PRETTY.
            [laughs]

       - I LOVE THAT LOOK
         YOU GAVE HIM.
        OH, MY GOODNESS.
         OKAY, CHELSEY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - I KNOW THE FRIEND
          IS CASSIDY.
           - CASSIDY.
      - SHE IS A SIZE TWO.
      SHE'S TAN AS CAN BE.

   SHE--SHE'S REALLY PRETTY.
           AND I KNOW
  THAT'S WHAT HE'S GONNA SAY.
    - YOU KNOW IT'S CASSIDY.
            - YEAH.

      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?
             - CA--
        - IT'S CASSIDY.
           [applause]

          - ALL RIGHT.
       CHRIS AND CHELSEY,
      JOHN AND STEPHANIE,

  IN HISTORY WOULD HE ZOOM OFF
        TO VISIT FIRST?
            CHELSEY.
        - OUR HONEYMOON.

    WE HAD AN AMAZING TIME.
      ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT.
        WE SCUBA-DIVED,
           SNORKELED,
       AND OTHER THINGS.

          - ALL RIGHT.
           STEPHANIE.
       - UM, I WOULD SAY

          THE REDSKINS
    WINNING THE SUPER BOWL.
  HE'S--HE LOVES THE REDSKINS.
  THEY'RE LIKE THE WORST TEAM
     IN THE NFL RIGHT NOW.

           BUT, YEAH.
     I THINK HE WOULD LOVE
          TO BE THERE.
     I THINK HE WAS LITTLE
         WHEN THEY WON,

  SO I WOULD SAY THE REDSKINS.
     - THE REDSKINS, OKAY,
 WHEN THEY WON THE SUPER BOWL.
           BRITTANY.

 - I WOULD SAY OUR WEDDING DAY.
  HE WATCHES OUR WEDDING VIDEO
      OVER AND OVER AGAIN
  LIKE IT'S HIS FAVORITE MOVIE
             EVER.

           all: AWW.
           - REALLY?
- YES. SO I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY
        OUR WEDDING DAY.
            - OKAY.
           [applause]

      YOU CAN'T BEAT THAT.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
 BESIDES YOUR BED, WHICH PIECE
   OF FURNITURE IN YOUR HOUSE

   HAS SEEN THE MOST ACTION?
           STEPHANIE.
         - I WOULD SAY
          THE SHOWER.

         - THE SHOWER.
              YES.
            - OKAY.
   - HE--YEAH, I GO INTO THE
 SHOWER, AND SOMETIMES HE JUST,

           YOU KNOW,
    HE SURPRISES ME, BUT...
   SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW, I'M--
      - THAT'S LIKE <i>PSYCHO.</i>
     THAT'S NOT, YOU KNOW.

   YOU KNOW, "WAIT A MINUTE!
             WAIT!"
   YOU KNOW, "WAIT A MINUTE."
   - HE'S GOTTEN BETTER NOW.
    NOW HE'LL, "BABE, BABE."

            - YEAH.
   - OKAY, I NEED A WARNING.
 RIGHT. EXACTLY. SO I WOULD SAY
      THE SHOWER, THOUGH.
          - BRITTANY.

    - I WOULD SAY THE COUCH.
          - THE COUCH.
     - IN THE LIVING ROOM.
            - OKAY.
            - YEAH.

WE'RE IN THE LIVING ROOM A LOT,
      AND, YOU KNOW, WE--
 YES, IT'S A VERY LOVING ROOM.
              YES.

           - CHELSEY.
         - I'M GONNA GO
      WITH THE COUCH ALSO.
       - WITH THE COUCH?
  - YUP. THERE'S AN INDENTION
          OF US THERE.

          - OH, YEAH?
            - YEAH.
        - SO THE COUCH.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
    HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

        IF I HAD CONTROL
 OF MY HUSBAND'S BANK ACCOUNT,
   I WOULD TAKE ALL THE MONEY
       HE BLOWS ON BLANK
 AND SPEND IT ON BLANK INSTEAD.
           BRITTANY.

  - I WOULD TAKE ALL THE MONEY
   HE BLOWS ON DVDs OR MOVIES
     AND BLOW IT ON SHOES.
          - ON SHOES.
        YOU LIKE SHOES.

        - I LIKE SHOES.
   - YOU OWN A LOT OF SHOES?
    - I OWN A LOT OF SHOES,

    AND I HOPE TO OWN MORE.
              YES.
           - CHELSEY.

       - WELL, MY HUSBAND
    IS THE CHEAPEST GUY IN--
   IT'S NOT THAT HE'S CHEAP.
  HE JUST DOESN'T SPEND MONEY
          ON ANYTHING.

            - OKAY.
- LIKE, EVERYTHING'S PLANNED OUT
  SO I'M GONNA SAY HE DOESN'T
  SPEND ANY MONEY ON ANYTHING,
      AND SO I WOULD BUY--
   IF I HAD HIS BANK ACCOUNT,

  I WOULD BUY ALL THE CLOTHES
   THAT I COULD EVER IMAGINE.
     - NOTHING AND CLOTHES.
     - NOTHING AND CLOTHES,
   BECAUSE HE DOESN'T BUY...

           - GOT IT.
             OKAY.
           STEPHANIE.
 - I WOULD SAY GAMBLING AS FAR
  AS, LIKE, FANTASY FOOTBALL,

  ALL THE MONEY HE SPENDS IN,
     LIKE, ONLINE GAMBLING.
 THEY'LL BET ON FOOTBALL GAMES.
   AND FOR ME TO GO SHOPPING.

   - FOR YOU TO GO SHOPPING.
            - YEAH.
           - GOT YOU.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
