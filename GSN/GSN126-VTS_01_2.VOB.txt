       - YOU'RE EXC--WOW!

  YOU ARE EXCITED TO BE HERE.
         THIS IS GOOD.
          WE HAVE SENT
      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE
         SO WE CAN ASK
      YOU SOME QUESTIONS.

          SO LET'S GET
         RIGHT INTO IT.
         ARE YOU READY?
         - ABSOLUTELY.
  - OKAY, THIS IS WHAT I LIKE.

     WHEN YOU AND YOUR WIFE
 HAD YOUR FIRST LESSON IN LOVE,
 WAS SHE MORE LIKE YOUR TUTOR,
          YOUR PUPIL,
       OR YOUR CLASSMATE?

            MICHAEL.
      - I WOULD HAVE TO GO
         WITH MY PUPIL.
    - YOU WERE TEACHING HER?

     - YES, I WAS ACTUALLY
      HAVING TO TEACH HER
         ABOUT THE MALE
       AND FEMALE ANATOMY
    WHEN WE WERE FIRST, UH--

      - THE STUFF THAT SHE
   DIDN'T LEARN IN THE BOOK.
           - EXACTLY.
            - OKAY.
     - THE HANDS-ON STUFF.
 - THE HANDS-ON STUFF--GOT YOU.

              ZAC.
      - LET'S SEE, I KNOW
 HOW SHE WANTS ME TO ANSWER IT,
   BUT I'M GONNA ANSWER IT--

       SHE WAS MY PUPIL.
 - SHE WAS YOUR PUPIL AS WELL.
      - YES, I LIKE TO GET
 A LITTLE MORE CRAZY, I GUESS.
            - OKAY.

   NOW, I HEARD YOU TWO HAVE
   ALTER EGOS FOR EACH OTHER.
 - WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET HIM?
           - I WOULD.
        - [silly voice]
         HI, I'M JONAS.

   IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.
           [laughter]
     - AND, UM, I LIKE JAM,

    AND I LIKE DOING THINGS
           WITH JAM.
             - OH!
         I LOVE JONAS.

     [cheers and applause]
           ALL RIGHT.
    CHELSEA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - UH, I HAVE TO SAY
     THAT SHE WAS MY PUPIL.

           - REALLY?
     - I GAVE HER A LESSON
       SHE NEVER FORGOT.
             - OH!

           [applause]
      WOW, GOT A ROOM FULL
       OF TEACHERS HERE.
         OH, BOY, OKAY.

    HUBBIES, NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
    YOU WOULD THINK MY WIFE
      IS GOING FOR HER PhD

      IN THE TV SHOW BLANK
      THE WAY SHE STUDIES
        IT WHEN IT'S ON.
              ZAC.

     - OH, I'LL HAVE TO SAY
        <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>
      'CAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS
          WATCHING IT.
  - OH, SO SHE'S EXPECTING YOU
     TO WIN THIS GAME, HUH?

            - YEAH.
             - OH.
       OKAY, NO PRESSURE
          AT ALL, ZAC.
      - NONE, NONE, NONE.
          - ALL RIGHT.

    CHELSEA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - SHE LOOKS AT <i>CSI</i> EVERY NIGHT.
   AS A MATTER OF FACT, IT'S
PROBABLY BEING DVR'D RIGHT NOW.
            - YEAH?
            - SO...

  - SHE THINKS SHE'S AN EXPERT
     AT SOLVING THE CRIMES?
 - WELL, MAYBE COMMITTING ONE.
             - OH.
      SO PLEASE DON'T MAKE
       A MISTAKE CHELSEA,

  'CAUSE YOU MIGHT DISAPPEAR.
            - YEAH.
         - DON'T--OKAY.
            MICHAEL.

 - I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO GO
     WITH <i>THE BIGGEST LOSER.</i>
 EVERY WEEK WE TELL EACH OTHER
   THE NEXT WEEK WE ARE GOING
TO EITHER DO SIT-UPS, WORK OUT,

     YOU KNOW, DO PUSH-UPS
    WHILE WE'RE WATCHING IT.
     AND THEN WE SIT THERE,
     EAT DORITOS AND OREOS.
     SO I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
        <i>THE BIGGEST LOSER.</i>

      - ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
 OUR FINAL QUESTION, HUSBANDS.
        SOME PEOPLE CALL
   AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN A FOX.
 BUT IF YOU WERE FORCED TO USE

   ANOTHER ANIMAL COMPARISON
         FOR YOUR WIFE,
     YOU WOULD THINK OF HER
       AS MORE OF A WHAT?
            CHELSEA.

         - A STALLION.
         - A STALLION?
         - YEAH, SHE'S
        MY BLACK BEAUTY.
             - OH!
            - YEAH.

        - YOU HEAR THAT?
             OKAY.
            MICHAEL.
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
          A LIONESS...

          - A LIONESS.
        - BECAUSE SHE'S
      A VERY STRONG WOMAN.
       SHE'S INDEPENDENT.

  SHE COULD, IF SHE NEEDED TO,
       HUNT FOR HERSELF.
         BUT SHE'S ALSO
         VERY MOTHERLY
         AND TAKES CARE
   OF OUR CHILDREN VERY WELL.

           - LOVE IT.
              ZAC.
     - UM, I HATE TO COPY,
       BUT, YOU KNOW, UH,

           ALL RIGHT!
  YOU LOVELY LADIES ARE BACK,
    AND WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS.

     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     IS WORTH FIVE POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

        LADIES, WHEN YOU
        AND YOUR HUSBAND
 HAD YOUR FIRST LESSON IN LOVE,
         DID HE SAY YOU
   WERE MORE LIKE HIS PUPIL,

  HIS TUTOR, OR HIS CLASSMATE?
           DANIELLE.
             - HMM.

  WELL, I WOULD SAY CLASSMATE,
 BECAUSE WE DID HAPPEN TO MEET
           IN SCHOOL.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    MICHAEL, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

      - I WENT WITH PUPIL.
        - YOU WERE HIS--
            - UM...
       I WAS HIS STUDENT.
            - YEAH.

- 'CAUSE MICHAEL SAID HE TAUGHT
  YOU ABOUT THE MALE ANATOMY--
     STUFF YOU DIDN'T LEARN
          IN THE BOOK.
           - [sighs]
          - [chuckles]

            - OKAY.
     TANIA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - UM, CLASSMATE.

     - WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
  - BECAUSE, UM, HE TAUGHT ME
      A FEW THINGS IN BED.
          - ALL RIGHT.
      WHAT'D YOU SAY, ZAC?

            - PUPIL.
 - ZAC SAID YOU WERE HIS PUPIL.
         - THAT'S WHAT
    THAT SOUNDED LIKE TO ME.
          WHAT'D YOU--
     YOU DESCRIBED A PUPIL.

         - YEP, PUPIL.
            - SORRY.
    - IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
            - OKAY.
   WHAT DID YOU SAY, TIFFANY?

          - HIS TUTOR.
     - WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
     - BECAUSE I WAS ALWAYS
    TEACHING HIM NEW STUFF.

             - OH!
           OH, WELL!
   CHELSEA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - I SAID PUPIL.
     - YOU WERE HIS PUPIL.
            - PUPIL.
   - WAIT A MINUTE, CHELSEA.
           I NEED TO
        FIGURE THIS OUT,

      BECAUSE WHEN TIFFANY
     WASN'T HERE, YOU SAID,
"YEAH, I TAUGHT HER EVERYTHING,
       THE RIGHT MOVES"--
     AND I MEAN, YOU KNOW--
          ARR-ARR-ARR!

     - I WOULD LIKE TO SAY
     WE TAUGHT EACH OTHER.
 - OH, YOU WANT A DO-OVER, HUH?
       - YEAH, A DO-OVER.
          - ALL RIGHT.

   THIS IS OUR NEXT QUESTION,
            LADIES.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    YOU WOULD THINK MY WIFE
      IS GOING FOR HER PhD

      IN THE TV SHOW BLANK
     THE WAY SHE STUDIES IT
         WHEN IT'S ON.

 - WHY DO YOU SAY <i>AMERICAN IDOL?</i>

WE LIKE SINGING AND ACTING, TOO.

        - YEAH, I HEARD

     - OH, JOAN AND JONAS.
            - YEAH.
  WELL, WE GOT TO MEET JONAS,
       CAN WE MEET JOAN?

        - [silly voice]
         HI, I'M JOAN.
  AND DID JONAS TELL YOU THAT
   WE HAD A DOG NAMED JANCY?
    AND JANCY GOES, "RUFF!"

          - I LOVE IT!
           I LOVE IT!

    WHAT ABOUT YOU, TIFFANY?
   - MY FAVORITE SHOW IS <i>CSI.</i>
        - OKAY, CHELSEA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

               <i>CSI!</i>
     [cheers and applause]
           [laughing]

      ALL RIGHT, DANIELLE.
          - I'M GOING
     WITH <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
   LATELY--WE HAVE THE GAME,
    SO EVERY CHANCE WE GET,

      I'M LIKE, "BABE, GET
      OUT OF THE BATHROOM,
     GET OUT OF THE SHOWER,
        COME HERE NOW."
        WHEREVER IT IS,
   I'M TEXTING HIM QUESTIONS,

            THINGS--
     WE GOTTA GET IT DOWN,
   HOW DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER.
            - OKAY.
   MICHAEL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

  - WE OBVIOUSLY DID BETTER AT
HOME THAN WE'RE DOING RIGHT NOW.
  - HE SAID <i>THE BIGGEST LOSER.</i>
   <i>- I SAID</i> <i>THE BIGGEST LOSER.</i>
        WE ALWAYS WATCH
        <i>THE BIGGEST LOSER,</i>

          EVERY WEEK,
 AND WE SIT THERE EATING OREOS
      WHILE EVERYBODY ELSE
        IS WORKING OUT.
   WE KEEP SAYING WE'RE GONNA
    WORK OUT, BUT WE DON'T.

        - IT'S STILL NOT
       THE RIGHT ANSWER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            THIS IS
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.

        SOME PEOPLE CALL
   AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN A FOX.
      BUT IF YOUR HUSBAND
       WERE FORCED TO USE
   ANOTHER ANIMAL COMPARISON
            FOR YOU,

   HE SAID HE'D THINK OF YOU
       AS MORE OF A WHAT?
            TIFFANY.
           - A TIGER.

   - WHY DO YOU SAY A TIGER?
       - BECAUSE I'M WILD
        IN THE BEDROOM.
             - OH!

           ALL RIGHT.
   CHELSEA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      HE SAID A STALLION.
             - OH.
            - YEAH.

   - WHICH IS ACTUALLY A MALE
  HORSE, BUT THAT'S GOOD, TOO.
           [laughter]
      ALL RIGHT, DANIELLE.

    - I'M GONNA SAY A LION.
         - WHY A LION?
   LIONESS--I HAVE CHILDREN,
          MOTHERLY...

             - YES.
  - CURLY, FLOW-Y MANE TODAY.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    MICHAEL, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

           - LIONESS.
          - GOOD JOB.
            - YEAH.

       ALL RIGHT, TANIA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I WOULD SAY MONKEY.
          - A MONKEY?
             OKAY.

      WHAT'D YOU SAY, ZAC?
      - I SAID LIONESS...
      - HE SAID A LIONESS.
      - BECAUSE YOU'RE A--
- YOU NEVER SAID I'M A LIONESS.

         - I ALWAYS SAY
        THAT YOU BOSS--
    YOU'RE ALWAYS BOSSING ME
       AROUND THE HOUSE.
    YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

         - BUT LIONESS
   IS SUPPOSED TO BE, LIKE--
  - MOTHERLY, LOVING, CARING.
            - YEAH.
    - DO I GET POINTS BACK?
             - NO.

   [imitates buzzer sounding]
    - DIDN'T GO. ALL RIGHT,
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
     MICHAEL AND DANIELLE,
          YOU ARE TIED

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         IT'S YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.

        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
     ARE YOU READY, LADIES?
           all: YEAH.
     - OKAY, WHEN YOUR MAN
  PUTS HIS PEN TO YOUR PAPER,

    HOW MUCH CAN HE GET DOWN
  BEFORE HE RUNS OUT OF INK--
        AN ENDLESS EPIC,
      A SATISFYING NOVEL,
        OR A SHORT STORY
      YOU WISH WAS LONGER?

           DANIELLE.
        - I'M GONNA SAY
      A SATISFYING NOVEL.
         - OKAY. TANIA.

         - I WOULD SAY
       SATISFYING NOVEL,
  BECAUSE HE HAS, UM, CONTROL
      OF WHEN IT HAPPENS.
          - ALL RIGHT.

  AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, TIFFANY?
      - SATISFYING NOVEL.
      HE ALWAYS PLEASES ME
          IN THE BED.

            - OKAY.
      SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS
   GET REALLY GOOD READS ON.
             OKAY.

     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.
     COMPLETE THIS PHRASE--
    I'M SURE HE DOESN'T BRAG
   TO HIS FRIENDS ABOUT THIS,
         BUT MY HUSBAND
IS ACTUALLY FANTASTIC AT BLANK.

             TANIA.
        - HE'S FANTASTIC
     AT BEING A GENTLEMAN.
            - YEAH?
         - HE'S GREAT.

             - OH!
         OKAY. TIFFANY.
   - HE'S PROBABLY FANTASTIC
        ABOUT MASSAGES.

     IF I ASK FOR A MASSAGE
AND HAD A STRESSFUL DAY AT WORK,
    HE NORMALLY DOESN'T HAVE
  A PROBLEM TO GIVE THAT TO ME
       AND HELP ME RELAX
       AFTER A LONG DAY.

       - YOU'RE SO LUCKY.
   ALL RIGHT, AND, DANIELLE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - BEING REALLY HARDWORKING.

             - YES?
            - YEAH.
      HE WORKS THREE JOBS,
 AND, UH, HE JUST NEVER STOPS.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    YOU GUYS GOT GREAT MEN.

            - WE DO.
        - YOU REALLY DO.
           ALL RIGHT.

        NOW, A QUESTION
     FROM E.L.F. COSMETICS,
      WHERE YOUR BEAUTIFUL
      EYES, LIPS, AND FACE
           DON'T COST
       AN ARM AND A LEG.

    IF WE GIVE YOUR HUSBAND
        A FULL MAKEOVER,
   WHAT PART OF HIM IS GOING
     TO NEED THE MOST WORK?
            TIFFANY.

          - HIS FEET.
          - HIS FEET?
    TELL ME ABOUT HIS FEET.
   - THEY NEED TO BE KEPT UP.

          - [laughing]
             OKAY.
           DANIELLE.
        - I'M GONNA SAY,
       UM, HIS BODY HAIR.

         - OKAY. TANIA.
 - HE WOULD PROBABLY SAY LOSING
  SOME OF THE BELLY WEIGHT...
            - OKAY.
     - MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.

          - THE BELLY.
        OKAY, GOT YOU..
         LADIES, HERE'S
       A BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.

          HERE WE GO.
            LADIES,
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
     YOU'D THINK MY HUSBAND
        AND I WERE TWINS

    BASED ON OUR MUTUAL LOVE
           FOR BLANK,
     BUT YOU'D NEVER GUESS
        WE WERE MARRIED
      IF YOU SAW HOW MUCH
     WE DISAGREE ON BLANK.

           DANIELLE.
  - OUR MUTUAL LOVE FOR MUSIC
      AND DISAGREE ON SEX.

 - WHAT DO YOU DISAGREE ABOUT?
         - HE'S A GUY.
      HE ALWAYS WANTS IT.
    WE'RE A MOTHER, WORKING,
 AND THERE'S THINGS IN THE WAY.

            - OKAY.
             TANIA.
   - MUTUAL LOVE FOR THEATER

   AND OUR DISAGREEMENT ON--
         THAT HE THINKS
      I COMPLAIN TOO MUCH,
         AND THEN I SAY
   I DON'T COMPLAIN TOO MUCH,

   AND THEN WE KIND OF GET...
      [imitating arguing]
          ALL THE TIME
    AND SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
       SO MY COMPLAINING.
     - ALL RIGHT. TIFFANY.

   - OUR LOVE FOR TRAVELING.
           - MM-HMM.
  - WHAT WE ARGUE MOSTLY ABOUT
   IS HOW I MAINTAIN MY HAIR.

            - OKAY.
   LADIES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
  WE'LL SEE IF THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

           ALL RIGHT,
       THE GUYS ARE BACK
    TO SEE IF THEY CAN MATCH
 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE.

       ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
        HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
     WHEN YOU PUT YOUR PEN
     TO YOUR WIFE'S PAPER,

      HOW MUCH DID SHE SAY
        YOU CAN GET DOWN
           BEFORE YOU
        RUN OUT OF INK--
        AN ENDLESS EPIC,

      A SATISFYING NOVEL,
        OR A SHORT STORY
      YOU WISH WAS LONGER?
            MICHAEL.

        - UM, A NOVEL...
     - A SATISFYING NOVEL.
         - BECAUSE IT'S
   THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME.

  YOU PUT IN THE RIGHT AMOUNT
           OF EFFORT,
 YOU DON'T WANNA GO OVERBOARD.
  BUT YOU ALSO DON'T WANNA BE
   SO QUICK THAT IT'S A POEM.

     - YOU HAVE REALLY PUT
    SOME THOUGHT INTO THIS.
       - UH, YES, I HAVE.
         I'VE MASTERED
     THE ART A LITTLE BIT.

 - DANIELLE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - A SATISFYING NOVEL.
  YOU CERTAINLY DID MASTER IT.

        ALL RIGHT, ZAC,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - SATISFYING NOVEL AS WELL.
    - TANIA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

      A SATISFYING NOVEL.
          YES, YOU DO.
      ALL RIGHT, CHELSEA.

      - I'D SAY DEFINITELY
     ON AVERAGE SATISFYING.
            - OKAY.
   TIFFANY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

      A SATISFYING NOVEL.
     [cheers and applause]
             YEAH.
            [laughs]

           ALL RIGHT.
 GENTLEMEN, OUR NEXT QUESTION--
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
     COMPLETE THIS PHRASE?
    I'M SURE HE DOESN'T BRAG
   TO HIS FRIENDS ABOUT THIS,

         BUT MY HUSBAND
IS ACTUALLY FANTASTIC AT BLANK.
              ZAC.
   - I'M GOOD AT HELPING HER
 PICK OUT CLOTHES AND--FASHION.

 FASHION A LITTLE BIT, I GUESS.
             - YES?
    TANIA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           TANIA SAID
       BEING A GENTLEMAN.

        - AW, THANK YOU.
       - YOU'RE WELCOME.
     - ALL RIGHT. CHELSEA.
       - I'M FANTASTIC...

     PLAYING THE SAXOPHONE.
     - ALL RIGHT, TIFFANY--

      SHE SAID MASSAGING.

             - OH.
     I'M GOOD AT THAT, TOO.
           - [laughs]

            MICHAEL.
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
         PROBABLY BEING
           A STRONG,
        HARDWORKING MAN.

          - ALL RIGHT.
  DANIELLE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      - I SAID HARD WORK.
    - GOT A HARDWORKING MAN.

             YEAH.
             YEAH!
           ALL RIGHT.

         NOW A QUESTION
     FROM E.L.F. COSMETICS.
         IF WE GAVE YOU
        A FULL MAKEOVER,
        WHAT PART OF YOU
       DID YOUR WIFE SAY

   WOULD NEED THE MOST WORK?
            CHELSEA.
           - MY FEET.
         SHE SAYS THAT
     I HAVE EAGLE'S CLAWS.

        - EAGLE'S CLAWS.
           - I KNOW.
   - TIFFANY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         - THOSE FEET.

     [cheers and applause]
            MICHAEL.
  - I'M GONNA GO WITH MY SKIN,

 BECAUSE I GET DRY SKIN A LOT,
         UM, ESPECIALLY
    DURING THE WINTERTIME--
A LITTLE HEAD & SHOULDERS TO TRY
  TO HELP OUT WITH THE SCALP,

 BUT I HAVE A LITTLE PSORIASIS,
     SO I GET SOME DRY SKIN
        HERE AND THERE.
      - YOU'RE JUST GONNA
        KEEP GOING, HUH?

       - SO I'M GONNA GO
         WITH MY SKIN.
          - [laughing]
           ALL RIGHT.
   DANIELLE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - I SAID BODY HAIR.

           - OH, NO!
     - YOU DON'T HAVE ACNE.
     - NO, BUT THE DRY SKIN
          IN MY EARS.
        - I KNOW, YEAH.
     - I GOTTA PICK IT OUT.

      IT'S KIND OF NASTY.
            - YEAH.
           [laughter]
             OKAY.

        ALL RIGHT, ZAC,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - OH, DEFINITELY HAVE
   TO SAY CLIPPING MY NAILS.
             - YES?

 - I LET IT GO A LITTLE LONGER
     THAN I'M SUPPOSED TO.
          - [laughing]
             OKAY.
     TANIA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

          - HIS BELLY.
         - YOUR BELLY.
         - BUT HIS TOES
        ARE HORRENDOUS.
   - THE TOES ARE HORRENDOUS.

      ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.
     MICHAEL AND DANIELLE,
       YOU ARE STILL TIED
   WITH CHELSEA AND TIFFANY.

         YOU GUYS BOTH
        HAVE 25 POINTS.
        SO STICK AROUND.
    OUR FINAL BONUS QUESTION
         IS COMING UP,

        AND IT IS WORTH
        UP TO 30 POINTS.
        ANYBODY CAN WIN.
         DON'T GO AWAY.
I can't stand these spots.

     Those spots are actually
     leftover food and detergent

               redeposit on your
                 dishware during
                the rinse cycle.

          so the only thing left
          behind is the shine.

       a sparkling shine.

     HERE'S WHERE WE STAND.
       COUPLE NUMBER ONE
    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE,

       YOU GUYS ARE TIED
FOR FIRST PLACE WITH 25 POINTS.
         BUT IT'S TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.
  IT'S WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
  THIS CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.

      ARE YOU GUYS READY?
         - ABSOLUTELY.
         - HERE WE GO.
    GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR
  WIFE COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

     YOU'D THINK MY HUSBAND
        AND I WERE TWINS
    BASED ON OUR MUTUAL LOVE
           FOR BLANK,
 BUT YOU'D NEVER GUESS WE WERE
  MARRIED IF YOU SAW HOW MUCH

     WE DISAGREE ON BLANK.
              ZAC.
            - UM...

           DEFINITELY
   THE FIRST ONE IS THEATER,
  BECAUSE WE WORK IN THEATER.
      WE LIVE IN THEATER.
  WE TEACH CHILDREN'S THEATER.

       AND, UH, DISAGREED
       ON WHAT TO WATCH--
     WHAT TV SHOW TO WATCH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    TANIA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        SHE SAID THEATER
      AND HER COMPLAINING.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
      - YOU SAY I COMPLAIN
         ALL THE TIME.

     [cheers and applause]
         - SO RIGHT NOW
        EVERYBODY'S TIED
        FOR FIRST PLACE.

      ALL RIGHT, MICHAEL.
 - I WOULD HAVE TO PROBABLY GO
 WITH OUR MUTUAL LOVE OF MUSIC.
          - ALL RIGHT.

   - AND THEN THE SECOND PART
 IS DEFINITELY SPENDING MONEY.
          - DANIELLE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  YOU SAID YOU AGREE ON MUSIC
      AND DISAGREE ON SEX.

             - OH!
             - YES.
    - SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
      YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
       - WE JUST DISAGREE
  ABOUT HOW OFTEN WE HAVE SEX,

           NOT ABOUT
     THE ACTUAL SEX ITSELF.
            - YEAH.
   - YEAH, IT LOOKED LIKE IT
    WASN'T HAPPENING OFTEN.

ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO
          TO CHELSEA.
      - WE LOVE TO TRAVEL,
   SO THAT'S WHAT WE AGREE ON
            IN LIFE.

        UM, AND WHAT WE
       DISAGREE ON IS...
       ME COOKING DINNER.
   SHE DOES ALL THE COOKING.
            I DON'T.

  AND I'M GONNA WORK ON THAT.
            - OKAY.
   TIFFANY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     SHE SAID TRAVELING AND
   THE WAY SHE DOES HER HAIR.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
    AND LET'S LOOK AT THIS.

 MICHAEL AND DANIELLE, YOU ARE
 TIED WITH CHELSEA AND TIFFANY.
  SO THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO GO
        TO A TIEBREAKER.
     [cheers and applause]

        BEFORE THE SHOW,
      WE ASKED EACH COUPLE
     TO PREDICT WHAT THEIR
     FINAL SCORE WOULD BE,
           THE COUPLE
        WHOSE PREDICTION

         COMES CLOSEST
      TO THE ACTUAL SCORE
       WITHOUT GOING OVER
      WILL BE THE WINNER.
       SO WE'RE GONNA GO
 TO CHELSEA AND TIFFANY FIRST.

       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          YOU SAID 45.
  ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING TO GO
    TO MICHAEL AND DANIELLE.

     WHAT DID YOU GUYS SAY?
              40.
        CONGRATULATIONS.
   YOU GUYS ARE THE WINNERS.

         YOU ARE GOING
    TO THE CANADIAN ROCKIES.
      AND A SPECIAL THANKS
   TO OUR RUNNER-UP COUPLES.

      TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
  HELLO, FELLAS. HOW ARE YOU?
            - GOOD.
 - WE'RE GONNA GET RIGHT TO IT,
BUT WE SENT YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE

       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS, AND HERE WE GO.
       GENTLEMEN, WE KNOW
  WHAT YOU WOULD WANT TO SEE,
 BUT IF IT WAS UP TO YOUR WIFE,

    WOULD SHE CHOOSE TO GET
    A LAP DANCE FROM A MALE
     OR A FEMALE STRIPPER?
             SHANE.

    - I THINK SHE'D PROBABLY
         TAKE THE MALE.
 - WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO SEE?
     - I'D TAKE THE FEMALE.
             - AHH.

              JOE.
    - UH, YEAH, I WOULD LIKE
       TO SEE THE FEMALE,
 BUT I THINK SHE WOULD, UH--SHE
 WOULD DEFINITELY DO THE MALE.

     - SHE WOULD DEFINITELY
        GO FOR THE MALE.
            - YEAH.
   - CEDRIC, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - YEAH, YEAH, PROBABLY AGAINST
     ALL OF MY SUGGESTIONS,

       SHE WOULD PROBABLY
     CHOOSE THE MALE, YEAH.
            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    NEXT QUESTION, HUSBANDS.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
      LADY GAGA'S HIT SONG
          <i>BORN THIS WAY</i>
COULD REALLY APPLY TO MY WIFE'S
      PROBLEM WITH BLANK,

       BECAUSE, HONESTLY,
       SHE CAN'T HELP IT.
              JOE.
   - UM, SHE'S A CLEAN FREAK.

       I MEAN, SHE JUST,
        UH, CONSTANTLY--
    I CAN'T PUT A GLASS DOWN
  WITHOUT IT BEING IN THE SINK
          IN A SECOND,

        SO SHE'S VERY--
            - YEAH?
 SHE'S NEUROTIC WITH THAT, YES.
        - OKAY. CEDRIC.
     - LIKE, STUBBORNNESS.
     OH, YEAH, SHE'S, UM...

      YEAH, WHENEVER I SAY
      ANYTHING ABOUT THAT,
 HER REPLY IS THAT "I'M--THAT'S
 JUST HOW I AM. THAT'S JUST--"
  SO, YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

          - STUBBORN.
             - YES.
         - OKAY. SHANE.
     - SHE'S WAY TOO BLUNT.
    AND EVERY TIME SHE SAYS

   SOMETHING THAT WILL OFFEND
   SOMEBODY, OR PRIMARILY ME,
         UH, SHE JUST--
    HER RESPONSE IS ALWAYS,
    "I'M JUST BEING HONEST."

          - ALL RIGHT.
   FINAL QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
   IN TEXTING, L.O.L. STANDS
    FOR "LAUGHING OUT LOUD,"
           AND B.R.B.
     MEANS "BE RIGHT BACK."

    FOLLOWING THAT PATTERN,
 HOW WOULD YOU TEXT THE PHRASE
      YOUR WIFE USES MOST
        IN THE BEDROOM?

            CEDRIC.
          - [laughing]
        WHOO! UH, I.A.C.

           - I.A.C.?
            - YEAH.
    - WHAT'S THAT STAND FOR?
 - DO YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW?
            - I DO.

  - ALL RIGHT, I'M--YOU KNOW,
         I'LL TELL YOU.
            - OKAY.
         - IT'S, UH...
  I'M ABOUT TO, UH, YOU KNOW.

             - OHH!
            - YEAH.
   IF YOU WILL, IF YOU WILL.
          - WE GOT IT.
  - IF YOU WILL. I DON'T KNOW.

            - OKAY.
     - BETWEEN ME AND YOU,
     BETWEEN ME AND YOU...
            - I.A.C.
      BETWEEN ME AND YOU.
       - GOT YOU. SHANE.

       - MAYBE JUST O.Y.
 FOR "OH, YEAH," I DON'T KNOW.
            - O.Y.?
             - OY.
       - ALL RIGHT. JOE.
      - I WOULD SAY O.M.G.

         - O.M.G., HUH?
   - YEAH, JUST, YOU KNOW...
           IT'S GOOD.
          - HOW DOES--
      HOW DOES SHE SOUND?

      - JUST ENJOYING IT.
   - SHE'S JUST ENJOYING IT.
     - SO O.M.G., IS THAT,
         "OH, MY GOD"?
             - YES.

   - OKAY. ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
      THANK YOU. NICE JOB.

      LADIES, HERE WE GO.

   WOULD WANT TO SEE, LADIES,

   BUT IF IT WERE UP TO YOU,
    WOULD YOU CHOOSE TO GET
    A LAP DANCE FROM A MALE
     OR A FEMALE STRIPPER?
             JANE.

   - THIS ONE'S A TOUGH ONE.
             - OH.
            - UM...
            [sighs]
  - THIS ONE'S A TOSS-UP, HUH?

     'CAUSE I HAVE A CRUSH
      ON ANGELINA JOLIE...
            - OKAY.
   - SO I'M GONNA SAY FEMALE.
    - SHANE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
    HE SAID A MALE STRIPPER.

            - MALE.
             - NO!
 - WELL, SHANE, THIS SHOULD BE
       GOOD NEWS FOR YOU.
- YEAH, YEAH, I'M GONNA TAKE HER
   UP ON THE OFFER NEXT TIME.

         - I WON'T EVER
      CHEAT ON HIM, RIGHT?
   - I WOULD SUGGEST WRITING
    ANGELINA JOLIE A LETTER
       RIGHT NOW, SHANE.
             - YES.

      - ALL RIGHT. TRICIA.
   - UM, EVEN THOUGH IT WOULD
     MAKE MY HUSBAND HAPPY
      IF I SAID A FEMALE,
  I WOULD HAVE TO SAY A MALE.

      - A MALE. ALL RIGHT,
      WHAT'D YOU SAY, JOE?
            A MALE.
           - A MALE.
     [cheers and applause]

         - OKAY. EBONY.
    - HE WOULD PROBABLY LIKE
        TO SEE A FEMALE,
   BUT I'M GONNA SAY A MALE.
           - A MALE.

    CEDRIC, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            - MALE.
     [cheers and applause]

   THAT WAS A GOOD FAKE-OUT,
     CEDRIC, I HAVE TO SAY.
 - THAT'S RIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT,
         THAT'S RIGHT.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
      LADY GAGA'S HIT SONG
          <i>BORN THIS WAY</i>
COULD REALLY APPLY TO MY WIFE'S
      PROBLEM WITH BLANK,

       BECAUSE, HONESTLY,
       SHE CAN'T HELP IT.
            TRICIA.
    - I CLEAN ALL THE TIME.
   AND HE ALWAYS YELLS AT ME
     AND SAYS, "CALM DOWN.

   YOU'RE CLEANING TOO MUCH."
           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.
  - OKAY. JOE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      BEING A CLEAN FREAK.

     [cheers and applause]
             OKAY.
             EBONY.

 - I'M GONNA SAY STUBBORNNESS,
   'CAUSE I REALLY LIKE TO DO
       WHAT I WANT TO DO
     WHEN I WANT TO DO IT.
           - REALLY?

        - THAT'S RIGHT.
           - CEDRIC.
    - SHE WOULD BE CORRECT.
        - STUBBORNNESS.
             - YES.

     [cheers and applause]
            - JANE.
  - I WOULD SAY LOSING THINGS,
   'CAUSE I LOSE EVERYTHING,
  AND IT REALLY BOTHERS SHANE.

    - SHANE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
          BEING BLUNT.
             - OHH!
        I HAVE AN ISSUE
        WITH THAT, TOO.

           - YOU DO?
             - YES.
       - LADIES, THIS IS
      YOUR FINAL QUESTION.
   IN TEXTING, L.O.L. STANDS
    FOR "LAUGHING OUT LOUD,"

           AND B.R.B.
     MEANS "BE RIGHT BACK."
    FOLLOWING THAT PATTERN,
    HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
    HE WOULD TEXT THE PHRASE

       YOU USE MOST OFTEN
        IN THE BEDROOM?
             EBONY.
         - MAYBE I.B.C.

            - I.B.C.
  WHAT DOES I.B.C. STAND FOR?
  - THAT MEANS THAT THE MOMENT
     IS NEAR, IF YOU WILL.
           [laughter]

 - THE MOMENT IS NEAR FOR WHAT?
       - FOR--FOR CLIMAX.
    - FOR CLIMAX, SO I.B.C.

    CEDRIC, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            - I.A.C.
          HECK, YEAH.
     [cheers and applause]

    - YEAH, YOU SAID I.B.C.,
 BUT WE FIGURED, YEAH, IT WAS--
       IT WAS THE I.A.C.
       - RIGHT, YOU KNOW,
     'CAUSE YOU DON'T THINK

  ABOUT DICTION AT THAT TIME.
           [laughter]
     [cheers and applause]
   - EBONY, YOU REALLY DON'T.
    THAT IS THE LAST THING--

  IF I'M GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT
          AT THE TIME.
        OH, ABSOLUTELY.
       YOU ARE SO RIGHT.
        ALL RIGHT, JANE.

            - N.R.N.
        - NOT RIGHT NOW.
             - OHH!

             - HEY!
      - NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
           JUST LOOK.
      - SHE GOES "N.R.N.,
      NOT RIGHT NOW. HEY!"

           [laughter]
         - BUT I SAY IT
      LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?
      - IT'S JUST THE MOST
        UNSEXY SEXTING.

            I MEAN--
      - THAT'S HOW I ROLL.
           [laughter]
      - ALL RIGHT, SHANE.
             N.R.N.

     IS THAT HOW YOU ROLL?
           - OY, O.Y.
          - OH, YEAH.

         - WHOO. YEAH.
     - PRETTY MUCH SUMS UP
   OUR SEX LIFE RIGHT THERE.

   - TRICIA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY I.T.T.
- I.T.T., WHAT DOES THAT STAND--
       - "I'M TOO TIRED."

             OKAY.
       N.R.N. AND I.T.T.

      JOE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - NOT I.T.T. O.M.G.
            - O.M.G.
             - AW.

     - OKAY, 'CAUSE I THINK
      WHEN JOE SAID O.M.G,
  HE WAS BEING REALLY HOPEFUL,
          LIKE, "OH--"
      ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.

 CEDRIC AND EBONY, YOU GUYS ARE

         - YEP, READY.

  - OKAY. SEX IS LIKE PIZZA--
      EVEN WHEN IT'S BAD,
        IT'S STILL GOOD,
      BUT CAN YOU TELL US
   WHAT HAPPENED THE ONE TIME

      YOUR HUSBAND SPOILED
       YOUR PIZZA PARTY?
             JANE.
 - HE LET ME FALL OFF THE BED.

    MY PIZZA PARTY WAS OVER.
 - HE LET YOU FALL OFF THE BED?
  WERE YOU GUYS TRYIN' STUNTS?
- WHEN WE FIRST STARTED DATING,

          I DON'T KNOW
    IF WE WERE MAKING PIZZA,
    EXACTLY, AT THAT TIME...
        - YEAH, UH-HUH.
        - BUT I JUST...
       [whistles] ROLLED.

- AND ROLLED RIGHT OFF THE BED.
            - YEAH.
        - OKAY. TRICIA.
          - UH, WE HAD
     A DESTINATION WEDDING,

  AND WE BOTH GOT REALLY SICK
 THE WHOLE WEEK WE WERE THERE,
          AND WE WERE
     ON SO MUCH MEDICATION
  THAT THE DAY OF OUR WEDDING,
       DRINKING CHAMPAGNE

 AND HAVING MEDICATION, WHEN WE
 FINALLY GOT BACK TO OUR SUITE,
        HE FELL ASLEEP.
             - OHH.
      - BUT I WOKE HIM UP.
      - BUT YOU--OH, YOU--

          - YES, YEAH.
            - OKAY.
             EBONY.
     - I'M GONNA SAY NEVER.

    - OKAY. LADIES, THIS IS
       OUR NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
    THE ONE THING MY HUSBAND
  CAN NEVER FIND IN OUR HOUSE

       IS BLANK. TRICIA.
          - HIS SOCKS.
          - HIS SOCKS?
   - THEY'RE ALWAYS MISSING.
WE THINK OUR DRYER EATS THEM UP.

      - ALL RIGHT. EBONY.
        - I'M GONNA SAY
        HIS DRESS SOCKS.
       AND HE BLAMES ME.
       HE BLAMES OUR SON.

    BUT HE LOSES HIS SOCKS.
           [laughter]
         - OKAY. JANE.

     - I WOULD SAY NOTHING.
   HE IS AN ORGANIZED FREAK.
   - OKAY, SO HE PRETTY MUCH
      CAN FIND EVERYTHING.
   - OH, YEAH, ON TOP OF IT.

       - HERE'S OUR NEXT
       QUESTION, LADIES.
    WHEN YOU FIRST LAID EYES
        ON YOUR HUSBAND,
WHAT DID YOUR INNER VOICE SAY--

 "I'VE JUST MET MY SOUL MATE."
   "WHY IS HE STARING AT ME?"
     OR "WHO IS THIS JERK?"

             EBONY.
  - "WHY IS HE STARING AT ME?"
 WE MET--WHEN I FIRST SAW HIM,

WE WERE IN HEALTH CLASS TOGETHER
          IN COLLEGE,
         AND, UM, YEAH,
   HE WAS DEFINITELY STARING.
   - SO EVERY TIME YOU TURNED
  AROUND, HE WAS--EYES AT YOU.

- EYES AT ME, OR HE WAS TAPPIN'
ME, TRYIN' TO ASK ME QUESTIONS.
            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.
        - SO HE WAS JUST
     KIND OF BOTHERIN' YOU.

      - YEAH, JUST A TAD.
     I DIDN'T MIND, THOUGH.
            - JANE.
 - I HAVE TO SAY NEITHER AGAIN,
    BECAUSE WE MET DANCING,
    SO I WAS MORE SO, LIKE,

   "DAMN, LOOK AT HIS BOOTY"
         TYPE OF THING.
           [laughter]
   - OKAY, BUT YOU GOT TO USE
      ONE OF THE CHOICES.

          - I HAVE TO?
            - YEAH.
       - UM, I'LL GO WITH
        THE SECOND ONE.
      - THE SECOND ONE IS
   "WHY IS HE STARING AT ME?"

            - RIGHT.
      - ALL RIGHT. TRICIA.
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY,
   "I JUST MET MY SOUL MATE."
     - YOU JUST MET YOUR--
- WE ACTUALLY MET ON MATCH.COM,

  ONLINE, AND WHEN WE FINALLY
    WENT ON OUR FIRST DATE,
      I JUST FELL IN LOVE
   WITH HIS EYES, AND I KNEW.
     - REALLY? OH, MY GOSH.

         SO BEAUTIFUL.
          - THANK YOU.
        - LADIES, HERE'S
       A BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.

 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
  IF IT WERE UP TO MY HUSBAND,
         WE WOULD SPEND

  AS LITTLE MONEY AS POSSIBLE
            ON BLANK
     AND BLOW AS MUCH OF IT
     AS WE COULD ON BLANK.
             JANE.

 - AS LITTLE MONEY AS POSSIBLE
     ON TABLOID MAGAZINES.
           - UH-HUH.
 - WE WOULD SPEND AS MUCH MONEY

         ON, UM, MOVING
        BACK TO CHICAGO.
        - OKAY. TRICIA.
 - I WOULD SAY AS LITTLE MONEY
 AS POSSIBLE ON PICTURE FRAMES,

   BECAUSE HE SAYS I HAVE WAY
  TOO MANY AROUND THE HOUSE...
            - YEAH.
      - AND AS MUCH MONEY
  ON VACATIONS AND TRAVELING.
      - ALL RIGHT. EBONY.

- HE WOULD SPEND AS LITTLE MONEY
    ON POSSIBLE--AS POSSIBLE
          ON BILLS...
           - MM-HMM.
     - AND WE WOULD SPEND--

   - YEAH, WHO NEEDS A PHONE,
         ELECTRICITY...
          - YOU KNOW?
         - CAR PAYMENT?
 - AND HE WOULD SPEND--WE WOULD
SPEND AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE

   ON VACATION OR TRAVELING.
    - VACATION OR TRAVELING.
           - MM-HMM.
      - ALL RIGHT. LADIES,
    THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH.

 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE,
          SO, FELLAS,

        HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
      SEX IS LIKE PIZZA--
      EVEN WHEN IT'S BAD,
        IT'S STILL GOOD,

 BUT WE ASKED YOUR WIFE TO TELL
 US WHAT HAPPENED THE ONE TIME
  YOU SPOILED HER PIZZA PARTY.
  WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE SAID?
             SHANE.

   - I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER
       SPOILED THE PARTY.
      - SO YOU'RE GONNA GO
         WITH NOTHING?
     - I'M SURE SHE'S GONNA
       MAKE ME LOOK BAD,

    BUT, YEAH, I'M GONNA GO
         WITH NOTHING.
   - JANE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
 YOU LET HER FALL OFF THE BED.

       - OH, YEAH, I DID.
           [laughter]
       - PRE-PIZZA PARTY.
  - YEAH, THAT WAS--THE PARTY
      HADN'T STARTED YET.

             - JOE.
      - I PROBABLY, UH...
   FINISHED WHAT I HAD TO DO
        AND FELL ASLEEP.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    TRICIA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

        YOU FELL ASLEEP
     ON THE WEDDING NIGHT.
             - AW.
   - NO, WE CAN'T TAKE THAT.
    IT WAS A DIFFERENT TIME
    YOU WERE TALKIN' ABOUT.

      I GUESS IT WAS LIKE,
     YOU FALL ASLEEP ONCE,
   YOU FALL ASLEEP A BUNCH OF
TIMES--IT'S ALL THE SAME THING.
     - YEAH, I WORK A LOT.
      - ALL RIGHT. CEDRIC.

     - MAYBE SHE WAS ABOUT
     TO REACH THAT POINT...
             - YES.
       - AND I GOT THERE
        BEFORE SHE DID.
 - DOES THAT HAPPEN FREQUENTLY?

             - HUH?
   NO, NO, NO, OF COURSE NOT.
           [laughter]
             - NO?
  - OF COURSE--OF COURSE NOT.

          - ALL RIGHT.
  - AH, THAT'S WHAT I THINK.
    - EBONY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        SHE SAID NEVER.

        HER PIZZA PARTY
    HAS NEVER BEEN SPOILED.
  ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA GO TO
 OUR NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

    THE ONE THING MY HUSBAND
  CAN NEVER FIND IN OUR HOUSE
           IS BLANK.
              JOE.
   - I'M GONNA SAY MY SOCKS.

  - YOUR SOCKS. ARE YOU ALWAYS
       LOSING YOUR SOCKS?
    - THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH.
 - THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH SOCKS.
 - SO, WHEN YOU BUY THE SOCKS--
  - NO, WE BUY A LOT OF SOCKS.

      - WHERE DO THEY GO?
        - I DON'T KNOW.
       WE'VE BEEN TRYIN'
      TO FIGURE THAT OUT.
WOW. IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE SHOULD
 BE A BUMPER STICKER FOR JOE--

 "THERE'S NEVER ENOUGH SOCKS."
       ALL RIGHT, TRICIA,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
          THOSE SOCKS.
         - OH, YOU DID?

     [cheers and applause]
         - AND, CEDRIC,
    WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?
         - PROBABLY GO
     WITH SOCKS, TOO, MAN.

        - HAVE YOU TAKEN
    YOUR CONCERNS TO EBONY?
  - SOMEWHAT, 'CAUSE I ALWAYS
         ASK HER, LIKE,
      "WHERE ARE--WHERE'S
SUCH AND SUCH?" BUT, YOU KNOW...

  - AND WHAT IS HER RESPONSE?
       - "I DON'T KNOW."
           SO, UH...
          - [laughing]
          OKAY, EBONY,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

      SHE SAID YOUR SOCKS.
        - WHOO-HOO-HOO!
         GIVE ME SOME.
           [applause]

         - OKAY, SHANE.
  - ALL RIGHT, IF WE GET THIS
         WRONG, I QUIT,
           BECAUSE...
            - DITTO.

          - ALL RIGHT,
     SHE LOSES EVERYTHING,
AND I'M, LIKE, SUPER TYPE "A"...
          - ALL RIGHT.
  - SO I'M GONNA SAY NOTHING.
          LIKE, NEVER.

  I KNOW WHERE EVERYTHING IS.
  - WELL, MAYBE YOU COULD TELL
         JOE AND CEDRIC
     WHERE THEIR SOCKS ARE.
         - YEAH, RIGHT?
     - MAYBE YOU COULD HELP

      EBONY AND TRICIA OUT
         A LITTLE BIT.
 MAYBE YOU GUYS COULD EXCHANGE
      PHONE NUMBERS, HUH?
        ALL RIGHT, JANE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

      - SO MUCH PRESSURE.
      - SHE SAID NOTHING.
             YEAH!
     [cheers and applause]

          - FIRST ONE.
    - ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    WHEN SHE FIRST LAID EYES
            ON YOU,

     WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY
     HER INNER VOICE SAID--
 "I'VE JUST MET MY SOUL MATE."
   "WHY IS HE STARING AT ME?"

     OR "WHO IS THIS JERK?"
            CEDRIC.
       - SHE HAD TO SAY,
   "I JUST MET MY SOUL MATE."

   - HOW DID YOU MEET EBONY?
       - WE WERE ACTUALLY
      IN A HEALTH CLASS...
            - OKAY.
     - AND SO I TAPPED HER

       ON THE SHOULDER--
      I ONLY SAW HER HAIR,
  SO I WAS LIKE, "WHO IS THIS
    WITH THIS PRETTY HAIR?"
    - YOU TAPPED HER ON THE
SHOULDER, AND SHE TURNED AROUND,

 AND EBONY'S INNER VOICE SAID,
  "I JUST FOUND MY SOUL MATE."
           - HAD TO.
            - OKAY.
             EBONY.

          EBONY SAID,
   "WHY IS HE STARING AT ME?"
    [laughter and applause]
   - YOU KNOW, THAT HAD TO BE
      HER SECOND THOUGHT.

      THAT WAS THE SECOND
       THOUGHT, YOU KNOW.
    - THE SECOND THOUGHT...
 - THAT WAS THE SECOND THOUGHT.
         - OKAY. SHANE.

    - THE FIRST TIME WE MET
        WAS AT A DANCE,
      AND FOR A WHITE BOY
         WITH GLASSES,
      I CAN ACTUALLY DANCE
          PRETTY WELL.

          - ALL RIGHT.
- AND WE HAD VERY GOOD CHEMISTRY
      ON THE DANCE FLOOR.
            - YEAH.
       - SO I'M FEELIN'--

      SHE MUST HAVE SAID,
    "THIS IS MY SOUL MATE."
    - JANE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
           SHE SAID,
   "WHY IS HE STARING AT ME?"

 - BUT I GAVE THE SAME REASON.
   - I WASN'T STARING AT YOU.
   - WE'RE JUST ON--WE'RE ON
   DIFFERENT PAGES RIGHT NOW.
            - OKAY.
           - ANYWAY.

       - ALL RIGHT, JOE.
  - UH, I WOULD SAY SOUL MATE.
          - SOUL MATE.
     - YEAH, WE, UH, SPENT
  A LOT OF TIME ONLINE BEFORE
     WE ACTUALLY, UH, MET,

         SO I KIND OF--
     IT KIND OF FELT RIGHT.
   - TRICIA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
    "JUST MET MY SOUL MATE."
         - OH, YOU DID.

  - ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE WHERE
    WE STAND WITH OUR SCORE.
    JOE AND TRICIA, YOU GUYS
ARE IN THE LEAD WITH 30 POINTS.
    STICK AROUND. OUR FINAL
  BONUS QUESTION IS COMING UP

     ARE YOU COUPLES READY?
            - YEAH.
    - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
  IF IT WERE UP TO MY HUSBAND,
 WE WOULD SPEND AS LITTLE MONEY
      AS POSSIBLE ON BLANK

     AND BLOW AS MUCH OF IT
     AS WE COULD ON BLANK.
             SHANE.
       - I HAVE A SLIGHT
   COFFEE-ADDICTION PROBLEM,

  SO I WOULD PROBABLY SAY I'M
 GONNA BLOW MY MONEY ON COFFEE,
         AND SHE SPENDS
       WAY TOO MUCH MONEY
          ON HER BAGS.
          - HER BAGS.

       - YEAH, SHE'S GOT
  AN UNHEALTHY BAG OBSESSION.
    - JANE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   - WELL, SHANE DREAMS BIG.
             BUT...

     - YOU SAID TABLOIDS...
          - MAGAZINES.
 - AND MOVING BACK TO CHICAGO.
            - YEAH.
     - I'M SO SORRY, GUYS.

 - YOU REALLY DROPPED THE BALL
          ON THAT ONE.
       - YEAH, I'M SORRY.
       - YOU DROPPED IT.
        - WE'RE GONNA GO

          - ON DRINKS?
          - [laughing]
        - BOY, YOU GUYS

       ARE BIG SPENDERS,
        I'M TELLIN' YOU.
     ALL RIGHT, ON DRINKS.
      AND YOU WOULD SPEND
  AS LITTLE MONEY AS POSSIBLE

           ON BLANK.
     - BILLS OR SOMETHING.
          - ON BILLS.
    EBONY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

 YOU SAID BILLS AND TRAVELING.
     SO YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
    - ALL RIGHT. THAT WORKS.
     [cheers and applause]

      - CEDRIC AND EBONY,
    YOU'RE NOW IN THE LEAD.
  WE'RE GONNA GO TO YOU, JOE.
YOU ONLY NEED TO GET ONE ANSWER
        CORRECT TO WIN.

          - OH, THAT'S

    HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.

    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
         MY WIFE CAN BE
    VERY KIND AND GENEROUS,
      BUT SHE CAN ALSO BE
        A TAD JUDGMENTAL

    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
             JACOB.
      - I'LL SAY DRIVING,
   WHEN IT COMES TO DRIVING.

           - DRIVING.
         - YES. SHE'S--

  THAT SCREAM AT OTHER PEOPLE?
 - YEP. SHE GETS A LITTLE CRAZY
  BEHIND THE WHEEL SOMETIMES,

       SO NOTHING, NADA,
     UNTIL JIM CAME ALONG.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
         - I SAID ZERO.

            - ZERO.
             - YAY!
            - YEAH.
            [laughs]

           ALL RIGHT,
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
         MY WIFE CAN BE
    VERY KIND AND GENEROUS,

      BUT SHE CAN ALSO BE
        A TAD JUDGMENTAL
    WHEN IT COMES TO BLANK.
           GRETCHEN?
      - PEOPLE'S CLOTHES.

    - JACOB, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - I SAID DRIVING.
           - DRIVING.
 - OKAY. I MEAN, I DEFINITELY--
     I'M NOT A NEW YORKER.
  I DEFINITELY HAVE ROAD RAGE.

            - YEAH.
      - I STILL LOVE YOU.
    - WE FIT RIGHT IN, GIRL.
           ALL RIGHT.
     WHAT ABOUT YOU, KATE?

- MAYBE PEOPLE'S JOBS, I GUESS.
     - ABOUT PEOPLE'S JOBS?
 - PEOPLE'S JOBS, WHAT THEY DO
         FOR A LIVING.
     - UM, WHETHER THEY'RE
        A HARD WORKER...

         - OKAY, YEAH.
       - OR KIND OF LAZY.
     - JIM, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - UM, I MIGHT HAVE
        TOOKEN IT WRONG,

    BUT I SAID ME GOING OUT
         WITH THE GUYS.
    - YEAH, WHEN HE GOES OUT
         WITH THE GUYS
    TO HAVE A COUPLE DRINKS.
    - WHAT? I THOUGHT IT WAS

       IN GENERAL, LIKE,
  WHAT AM I JUDGMENTAL ABOUT?
  - OH, YEAH, I MESSED IT UP.
            - YEAH.
       - IT'S ALL RIGHT.
       - OH, YOU'RE OKAY.

     - IT'S OKAY. JORDANA.
       - UM, I WOULD SAY
      HIM SMOKING HOOKAH.

           [laughter]
     - SO YOU GET--YOU GET
     A LITTLE JUDGMENTAL...
    - YEAH, I DEFINITELY DO.
    - ABOUT THAT. ALL RIGHT.

       WELL, YEAH, I CAN
        UNDERSTAND THAT.
     YANIV, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       TAKING DIRECTION.
          - AW, SORRY.

      - TAKING DIRECTION?
         - YEAH, SORRY.
           [laughter]
      - ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.

        THEY SAY VARIETY
     IS THE SPICE OF LIFE.
   ACCORDING TO YOUR HUSBAND,
   WHAT'S THE LAST NEW THING
  YOU BROUGHT INTO THE BEDROOM

      TO SPICE THINGS UP?
            - UM...
            - KATE.
 - TRY TO KEEP IT, UH, INNOCENT
      FOR MY MOM WATCHING.

             UM...
          - INNOCENT?
     THIS IS THE WRONG SHOW
      FOR INNOCENT, GIRL.
        YOUR MAMA KNOWS
 YOU'RE NOT INNOCENT. COME ON.

     - SOME SEXY LINGERIE.
        - SEXY LINGERIE.
      WHAT'D IT LOOK LIKE?
      - UM, GOSH, PROBABLY
        BLACK AND PINK.

  - BLACK AND PINK. ALL RIGHT,
      WHAT'D YOU SAY, JIM?
      - I SAID THE SCENTED
         MASSAGE OILS.
     - YOU REMEMBER THOSE?

  - YEAH, YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
         YOU'RE RIGHT.
  - SO DO YOU USE 'EM, OR YOUR
    HUSBAND USE 'EM ON YOU?
- HE USED 'EM ON ME, OF COURSE.
     - OH, THAT'S THE WAY.

             YEAH.
        - OKAY. JORDANA.
          - A FEATHER.
          - A FEATHER,

       AND WHAT DO YOU DO
       WITH SAID FEATHER?
     - UM, GIVE HIM CHILLS,
         I DON'T KNOW.
        - YEAH [laughs]

          DOES HE USE
      THE FEATHER ON YOU?
        - OCCASIONALLY.
       - YEAH? ALL RIGHT.
     YANIV, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

 THAT STICK WITH THE FEATHERS.
             - YAY!
    - OH, I LOVE THAT STICK.
          - THANK GOD!
           I LOVE IT.
           THANK GOD.

          EVERY NIGHT.

   - IT'S MY FAVORITE STICK,
           YOU KNOW?
 - THAT'S YOUR FAVORITE STICK?
     - WE'RE GONNA GO HOME
          AND USE IT.

           [laughter]
         - OH, MY GOSH.
        OKAY, GRETCHEN.

        - I REALLY HOPE
      HE SAID THIS RIGHT.
  I'M GONNA SAY WHIPPED CREAM.
        - WHIPPED CREAM.
      OH, IT SOUNDS YUMMY.

             OKAY.
             - OHH!
    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, JACOB?
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - I SAID LUBRICANT.
      - HE SAID LUBRICANT.

           - OHH, NO!
      IT'S WHIPPED CREAM.
  - WELL, I WAS THINKING THAT
      OR THE PORNO MOVIE.
             - OHH!

        - WAIT A MINUTE.
          - WE JUST--

 ALL RIGHT, LADIES, IT IS YOUR
TURN TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.
   THESE NEXT THREE ARE WORTH
        TEN POINTS EACH.

         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.
             - YEP.
      - OKAY, HERE WE GO.
       IF CROSS-DRESSING
     WERE GOING TO HAPPEN,

    WHO'D BE BETTER AT IT--
          YOU AS A MAN
  OR YOUR HUSBAND AS A WOMAN?
            JORDANA.

    - DEFINITELY MY HUSBAND
          AS A WOMAN.
             - WHY?
     - UM, HE LIKES, LIKE,
  DRESSING UP IN FUNNY THINGS

       AND RUNNING AROUND
        THE HOUSE, SO...
       - YEAH? WHAT KIND
        OF FUNNY THINGS?
       - UH, I DON'T KNOW
   IF I SHOULD SAY IT ON TV.

 - WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO ASK HIM.
    - YEAH, YOU CAN ASK HIM.
- OKAY, WE'LL ASK HIM. GRETCHEN.
   - I WILL SAY ME AS A MAN.
        - YOU AS A MAN.

        - BECAUSE HE IS
   WAY TOO STRAIGHT OF A MAN
 TO EVEN THINK ABOUT PUTTING ON
       ANYTHING OF MINE.
            - OKAY.
  - HE PUTS ON MY FLIP-FLOPS,

      BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT.
        THAT'S ABOUT IT.
         - OKAY. KATE.
  - I'M GONNA SAY ME AS A MAN.
 YES, JIM IS VERY--VERY MANLY.

   I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE
PUTTIN' ON ANYTHING THAT I WEAR,
     ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE HE'S
 A LITTLE BIGGER THAN ME, TOO,
 SO I DON'T THINK HE WOULD FIT
 IN ANYTHING THAT I WOULD WEAR.

   - OKAY. ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
 WE WOULD WIN THE CUTEST COUPLE
      AWARD IN A HEARTBEAT

 IF THE JUDGES GOT A LOOK AT US
         WHEN WE BLANK.
           GRETCHEN.
     - MAYBE, LIKE, GIVING

    SO IF ANYBODY SAW THAT.
          - ALL RIGHT.
            JORDANA.

   - UM, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
 THAT AN ANSWER WOULD BE, LIKE,
         MAKE WHOOPEE.
    [laughter and applause]

      - SO THEY WOULD SAY
    YOU'RE THE CUTEST COUPLE
  IF THEY SAW YOU WHEN YOU...
         - YEAH. YEAH.
 - OKAY, DOES THAT INCLUDE THAT
  FRENCH TICKLE DUSTER THING?

      - IT DEFINITELY CAN.
            - OKAY.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.
   WHEN IT COMES TO TIPPING,

        IS YOUR HUSBAND
  A LESS THAN 15% KIND OF GUY,
       A 15% TO 20% GUY,
       OR DOES HE BELIEVE
        IN OVERTIPPING?

             KATE.
     - I'D SAY 15% TO 20%.
         - 15% TO 20%.
       - MM-HMM. MM-HMM.
     - ALL RIGHT, JORDANA.

  - ALL RIGHT, AND WHAT ABOUT
         YOU, GRETCHEN?
     - UH, JAKE USED TO BE
          A BARTENDER,
SO HE'S AN OVERTIPPER, FOR SURE.
   - BECAUSE HE KNOWS. OKAY.

 - DEFINITELY. I'M ALWAYS LIKE,
"PULL SOME OF THAT MONEY BACK!"
        - BUT HE KNOWS.
     - ALWAYS, YEAH, YEAH.
  - ALL RIGHT. LADIES, HERE'S
       A BONUS QUESTION.

   IT HAS 2 PARTS. EACH PART
IS WORTH 15 POINTS. HERE WE GO.
     ON A SCALE OF 1 TO 5,
       1 BEING VERY FALSE
     AND 5 BEING VERY TRUE,

       HOW WOULD YOU RATE
   THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS?
  MY HUSBAND NEVER FANTASIZES
       ABOUT OTHER WOMEN,
     AND I NEVER FANTASIZE
        ABOUT OTHER MEN.

            JORDANA.
 - I'D SAY BOTH OF THEM ARE 3.
     - BOTH OF THEM ARE 3.
      - I'LL KEEP IT EVEN.

- OKAY, SO STAY IN THE MIDDLE...
            - YEAH.
      FOR BOTH. ALL RIGHT.
   WHAT ABOUT YOU, GRETCHEN?
      - SO VERY TRUE IS 5?
        - IS VERY--IS 5.

  - I'M GONNA SAY 5 FOR BOTH.
 - 5, THAT HE NEVER FANTASIZES
      ABOUT OTHER WOMEN--
   - I'M JUST--I'M THINKIN'.

   - AND YOU NEVER FANTASIZE
        ABOUT OTHER MEN?
  - HA-HAVE YOU SEEN THE MAN?
        - I'VE SEEN HIM.
       - I MEAN, HE LOOKS
       REALLY GOOD NAKED.

          - ALL RIGHT.
       - I'M JUST SAYIN'.
      - YOU ONLY GOT TIME
   FOR ONE IN YOUR MIND, HUH?
    - I DON'T NEED TO THINK
      ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE.

          - ALL RIGHT.
             KATE.
     - I'LL SAY 4 FOR BOTH.
         - 4 FOR BOTH.

           - MM-HMM.
   - OKAY, I LOVE HOW YOU ALL
       ARE ON THE SAME--
   YOU'RE THE SAME FOR BOTH.

         YOU AS A WOMAN
        OR HER AS A MAN?
