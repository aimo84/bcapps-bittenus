why wouldn't you make that call?

 IF YOUR PERSISTENT HEARTBURN

     MORE SERIOUS...
   LIKE ACID REFLUX DISEASE.

       OVER TIME, STOMACH
       ACID CAN DAMAGE
 THE LINING OF YOUR ESOPHAGUS.
 FOR MANY, PRESCRIPTION NEXIUM

   NOT ONLY PROVIDES 24-HOUR
   HEARTBURN RELIEF,
    BUT CAN ALSO HELP HEAL
    ACID RELATED EROSIONS IN
 THE LINING OF YOUR ESOPHAGUS.

 TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT THE
 RISK FOR OSTEOPOROSIS-RELATED
      BONE FRACTURES AND
      LOW MAGNESIUM LEVELS
 WITH LONG-TERM USE OF NEXIUM.

     POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
     INCLUDE HEADACHE,
  DIARRHEA AND ABDOMINAL PAIN.
  OTHER SERIOUS STOMACH
  CONDITIONS MAY STILL EXIST.

  LET YOUR DOCTOR DO HIS JOB,
  AND YOU DO YOURS.
ASK IF NEXIUM IS RIGHT FOR YOU.

      YOUR MEDICATION,

        ASTRAZENECA MAY
