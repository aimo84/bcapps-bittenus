    "THE U.S. STATE OF HAWAII
   IS LOCATED IN WHICH OCEAN?"

 JACOB HAS LOCKED IN HIS ANSWER.
     YOU EVER BEEN TO HAWAII?
I HAVE NOT BEEN TO HAWAII,
 BUT I'D LOVE TO GO.

            HOPEFULLY
       I CAN GO AFTER THIS.
     BUT I'M PRETTY POSITIVE
 THAT THE U.S. STATE OF HAWAII
IS LOCATED IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN.

    AND, YEAH, PACIFIC OCEAN.
     I'M GONNA LOCK THAT IN.
           [ APPLAUSE ]
Foxworthy: "U.S. STATE OF HAWAII
  IS LOCATED IN WHICH OCEAN?"

     YOU SAID PACIFIC OCEAN.
          YOU KNOW WHAT?

       YOU CAN SEE HAWAII.

         YOU'RE CORRECT.

          HOW YOU DOING?

     $25,000 IS A BIG NUMBER
       ON THE BOARD, ANDY.
   BECAUSE UP UNTIL THIS POINT,
     IF YOU'RE WRONG AND YOUR
 CLASSMATE DOESN'T BAIL YOU OUT,

    YOU GO HOME WITH NOTHING.
    IF YOU GET THIS ONE RIGHT,
       YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME
      WITH AT LEAST $25,000.

       SO CHOOSE CAREFULLY
   AND PICK YOUR NEXT SUBJECT.
     WHAT'S YOUR
STRONG SUBJECT, MARKI?
           UH, I LIKE MATH,
     BUT IT'S NOT THERE ANYMORE,

 GRAMMAR? OKAY, COOL.
LET'S GO WITH 2nd GRADE GRAMMAR.
     YEAH, YEAH.

        2nd GRADE GRAMMAR.
    THE $25,000 QUESTION IS...
"THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE CONTAINS
 HOW MANY POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS?

  'ALANA LET JACOB RIDE HER BIKE
  BECAUSE HIS HAD A FLAT TIRE.'"
       YOUR CLASSMATE MARKI
    HAS LOCKED IN HER ANSWER.
   WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, ANDY?

      UM, WELL,
  I'M THINKING TWO.
I'M PRETTY SURE IT'S TWO.
"ALANA LET JACOB RIDE HER BIKE."
     THERE'S ONE.

             "BECAUSE
      HIS HAD A FLAT TIRE."
         AND THAT'S TWO.
       "ALANA" AND "JACOB"
   AREN'T POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS.

      THEY'RE PROPER NOUNS.
        "BIKE" IS A NOUN.
  "BECAUSE HIS HAD A FLAT TIRE."

          "A FLAT TIRE."
    YEAH, I'M GONNA SAY TWO --
         "HIS" AND "HER."
      Foxworthy:
YOU GONNA LOCK THAT IN?

       I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
       AND LOCK THAT IN.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
       ANDY...

         PICK A SUBJECT,
 AND LET'S TURN IT INTO $50,000.
       I'LL GO
WITH WORLD GEOGRAPHY.
         WORLD GEOGRAPHY.

    3rd GRADE WORLD GEOGRAPHY.
         THESE QUESTIONS
      ARE NORMALLY ANSWERED
 BY PEOPLE THAT ARE 8 YEARS OLD.

  HERE IS THE $50,000 QUESTION.
       "WHAT IS THE CAPITAL
     OF THE UNITED KINGDOM?"
    ANDY, YOU HAVE THAT LOOK,

    LIKE ALL THE OTHER KIDS
HAVE BEEN PICKED UP FROM SCHOOL,
  AND YOU'RE JUST SITTING THERE
           BY YOURSELF.
      [ LAUGHS ]

     YEAH. YEAH.
  [ CLEARS THROAT ]
       "WHAT IS THE CAPITAL
     OF THE UNITED KINGDOM?"

       MARKI HAS LOCKED IN.
   WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, ANDY?
   OH, I'M THINKING
     IT'S LONDON,

    BUT I'M REALLY
  NOT SURE ABOUT IT.
           DO YOU KNOW
   WHAT THE UNITED KINGDOM IS?
        UM...

        YEAH,
IT'S A COUNTRY, RIGHT?
      [ LAUGHS ]
       I'LL TELL YOU THIS.

THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO ANSWER,
 BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU'RE WRONG,
      YOU'RE GONNA WALK OUT
          WITH $25,000.
   UNITED KINGDOM.
 I KNOW IT'S LONDON.

       I'M PRETTY POSITIVE
          IT IS LONDON.
             LONDON.
           OR ENGLAND.

             OH, GOD.
         I'M GONNA COPY.
     I THINK I'M GONNA COPY.

            I'M REALLY
        NOT SURE ABOUT IT.
  ANDY, IF YOU HAD HAD TO GUESS,
    WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID?
I WOULD HAVE SAID ENGLAND.

       NO, NO,
I WOULD HAVE SAID LONDON.
      LONDON WOULD HAVE BEEN
        THE RIGHT ANSWER.
            YOU DIDN'T
        GO WITH YOUR GUT.

  I KNOW. I DIDN'T
  GO WITH MY GUT.
             YOU WENT
     WITH A 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
           FOR $50,000,
   MAY WE SEE WHAT MARKI SAID?

       [ AUDIENCE GROANS ]
     YOU HAD NOTHING TO LOSE.
         YOU HAD $25,000.
     YOU STILL HAVE $25,000.

I DO.
    THAT'S A GOOD DAY'S WORK.
     REMEMBER OUR LITTLE DEAL
  WHEN YOU FIRST CAME OUT HERE?

 RIGHT, RIGHT, RIGHT.
      TELL THE WORLD, ANDY.
MY NAME'S ANDY, AND I AM

       I I WISH MY PATIENTS
      COULD SEE WHAT I SEE.

         THAT OVER TIME,
     HAVING HIGH CHOLESTEROL
        PLUS DIABETES...

        OR FAMILY HISTORY
    OF EARLY HEART DISEASE...
 CAN PUT THEM AT INCREASED RISK
       FOR PLAQUE BUILDUP.
         AND THEY'D SEE
    THAT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT

    TO GET THEIR CHOLESTEROL
    WHERE THEIR DOCTOR WANTS.
   AND WHY FOR THESE PATIENTS,

     WHEN DIET AND EXERCISE
      ALONE AREN'T ENOUGH,
      I PRESCRIBE CRESTOR.
         ADDING CRESTOR
     LOWERS BAD CHOLESTEROL

          BY UP TO 52%.
       AND IS ALSO PROVEN
     TO SLOW PLAQUE BUILDUP.

       IS YOUR CHOLESTEROL

            WELCOME TO THE SHOW.

HI. NICE TO MEET YOU.
                   HOW ARE YOU?
 VERY GOOD.
 I'M GUESSING THIS IS WHEN YOU
WERE GOING TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

     YES, IT IS.
        AND IT SAYS ON YOUR CARD
            THAT YOU ACTUALLY
         WANTED TO BE A TEACHER,

        AND YOU USED TO ACTUALLY
          PLAY SCHOOL AT HOME.
AND THAT YOU GOT CAUGHT STEALING
        SCHOOL SUPPLIES
                 FOR YOUR
         MAKE-BELIEVE CLASSROOM.

YEAH. MY FRIEND AND I, WE
THOUGHT IT WAS TOTALLY INNOCENT.
    WE JUST WANTED
TO BE LIKE OUR TEACHER.
           WHAT'D THEY DO TO YOU
            WHEN YOU GOT CAUGHT?

I HAD TO PICK UP TRASH

              I'VE GOT AN UNCLE

            BUT IT'S ON THE SIDE

      THEY'RE GONNA BE TAKING
    THE SAME TEST YOU'RE TAKING,
AND WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA LET YOU
       CHEAT OFF OF THEM

              DURING THE COURSE
                 OF THE TEST.
            SO PICK ONE OF THEM.
             LET'S GET STARTED.
      ALL RIGHT,
   HOW ABOUT ALANA?

         ALANA, COME ON UP HERE.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
  WHOO!

      Foxworthy: ALL RIGHT.
  LET ME TELL YOU HOW EASY IT IS
  TO WIN $1 MILLION AROUND HERE.
          ON THE BOARD,
  YOU'RE GONNA SEE 10 SUBJECTS.

    THEY RANGE FROM 1st GRADE
      THROUGH THE 5th GRADE.
        YOU CAN PICK THEM
      IN ANY ORDER YOU LIKE.
    YOUR FIRST CORRECT ANSWER
         IS WORTH $1,000.

        THE 10th QUESTION,
 SHOULD YOU ANSWER IT CORRECTLY,
        IS WORTH $500,000.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

          ACE THIS TEST,
          WE'LL GIVE YOU
     AN ADDITIONAL QUESTION,
     A GRADE-SCHOOL QUESTION,
 WHICH WILL BE WORTH $1 MILLION.

     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
   AND IF AT ANY POINT THE TEST
    GETS TO BE TOO DIFFICULT,
   YOU CAN DROP OUT OF SCHOOL.

      YOU CAN TAKE THE MONEY
     THAT YOU'VE ACCUMULATED
          TO THAT POINT,
      AND YOU CAN LEAVE US.

    BEFORE YOU GO, PROMISE ME
  YOU WILL LOOK INTO THAT CAMERA
  AND SAY TO THE ENTIRE PLANET,
        "I AM NOT SMARTER
       THAN A 5th GRADER."

                   DEAL.
   DEAL.
                 ALL RIGHT.
               LET'S FIND OUT --
      IS STEPHANIE WOMBACH
      SMARTER THAN A 5th GRADER?

         [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
        ALL RIGHT, ALANA.
        YOU SEE THE 10 SUBJECTS.
    IF YOU HAD TO HELP STEPHANIE
    WITH TWO OF THEM,

             WHAT WOULD THEY BE?
                ANIMAL SCIENCE
                AND GEOGRAPHY.
  ANIMAL SCIENCE AND GEOGRAPHY.
     1st GRADE AND 2nd GRADE.

ALL RIGHT, WELL, I LIKE
BOTH OF THOSE CATEGORIES.
     LET'S START
WITH 1st GRADE ANIMAL SCIENCE.
    1st GRADE ANIMAL SCIENCE.

            STEPHANIE,
    THE $1,000 QUESTION IS...
        "TRUE OR FALSE --
     BROWN BEARS CAN BE FOUND
  IN THE WILD IN NORTH AMERICA?"

  ALANA LOCKED IN BEFORE I COULD
   GET IT OUT THE SECOND TIME.
  ALL RIGHT. I THINK
SHE'S PRETTY CONFIDENT.
AND I AM ALSO VERY CONFIDENT
   THAT IT IS TRUE.

         DO YOU WANT TO
         LOCK THAT IN?
  I WANT TO
LOCK THAT IN.
         SHE SAID TRUE.
   WHAT MAKES YOU SO CONFIDENT
           ABOUT THAT?

WELL, WE HAVE THE GRIZZLY BEAR
HERE IN NORTH AMERICA.
           BROWN BEARS
        ARE GRIZZLY BEARS.
        YOU EVER MET ONE?

    NO.
           ME EITHER.
           I AM SCARED TO DEATH
           OF THEM.
                  [ LAUGHS ]

  LET'S BRING OUT A GRIZZLY BEAR
            RIGHT NOW.
           [ LAUGHTER ]
            STEPHANIE,
    YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

         YOU GOT $1,000.
         ALANA SAID TRUE,
             AS WELL.
      ALL RIGHT.

    LET'S TURN IT INTO $2,000.
      PICK ANOTHER CATEGORY.
 ALL RIGHT.
     [ INDISTINCT SHOUTING ]
MATH? I THINK EVERYONE
     WANTS MATH.

HOW ABOUT 1st GRADE MATH?
         1st GRADE MATH.
      FOR $2,000, STEPHANIE,
       HERE'S THE QUESTION.

           "A RECTANGLE
       HAS HOW MANY SIDES?"
        ALANA'S LOCKED IN.
   SHE'S LOCKED IN.
AND MY ANSWER IS FOUR SIDES.

     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
     THIS TEST IS EASY, HUH?
   SO FAR.

 THE QUESTION WAS HOW MANY SIDES
      DOES A RECTANGLE HAVE.
          YOU SAID FOUR.
             STEPH...

         YOU GOT $2,000.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
              ALANA,
       THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

      THEY CAN ONLY HELP YOU
     TWO QUESTIONS AT A TIME.
  THANK YOU, ALANA.
         ALL RIGHT, TIME TO PICK
            ANOTHER CLASSMATE.

      ALL RIGHT.
  HOW ABOUT SPENCER?
                   SPENCER,
               COME ON UP HERE.
     HI, SPENCER.

         YOU GOT $2,000.
 WE'RE ABOUT TO PLAY FOR $5,000.
   PICK ANOTHER SUBJECT THERE,
            STEPHANIE.
ALL RIGHT, I WANT 2nd GRADE
  ASTRONOMY, PLEASE.

       2nd GRADE ASTRONOMY.
           FOR $5,000,
      HERE IS THE QUESTION.
        "TRUE OR FALSE --
     METEOR SHOWERS CAN OCCUR

  WHEN THE EARTH PASSES THROUGH
   THE DUST OF A COMET'S TAIL."
     HE'S ALREADY LOCKED IN.
 WELL, JEFF, I KNOW THAT THERE'S
   TWO PARTS TO A COMET'S TAIL.

      ONE IS THE DUST TAIL,
     AND ONE IS THE GAS TAIL.
  AND THE DUST TAIL, I'M PRETTY
    SURE, IS MADE UP OF ROCK.
Foxworthy: LET ME TELL YOU
 HOW WE CAN HELP YOU.

YOU GOT TWO CHEATS.
             I KNOW.
      YOU CAN PEEK AT HIS PAPER.
    HE LOCKED IN BEFORE I EVEN
      REPEATED THE QUESTION.

            YOU PEEK,
  YOU COULD GO WITH HIS ANSWER.
      IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,
   YOU COULD GO WITH YOUR OWN.
     YOU CAN COPY HIS PAPER,

    WHICH MEANS YOU MUST TAKE
  THE ANSWER HE'S WRITTEN DOWN,
       OR YOU COULD GUESS.
 IF YOU'RE WRONG AND HE'S RIGHT,
         HE CAN SAVE YOU.

ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GONNA
GUESS, AND I'M GONNA GUESS TRUE.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
      OKAY, WE CAN ELIMINATE
         THE "SAVE" THEN,

     BECAUSE SPENCER SAID...
              TRUE.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

        HE CAN'T SAVE YOU.
     BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE TO
'CAUSE TRUE IS THE RIGHT ANSWER.
         YOU HAVE $5,000.

      ALL RIGHT.
      SEE HOW EASY THIS IS?
   I LOVE IT.

    YOU BROUGHT SOME FRIENDS.
   YOU WANT TO INTRODUCE THEM?
      HI, GUYS.
      ALL RIGHT.

     WE HAVE MARK
  HERE IN THE WHITE.
            HEY, MARK.
    WE HAVE CARLY.

        DAVE.
  AND MY BEST FRIEND
SINCE 5th GRADE, SCOTT COWLER.
       SCOTT, HOW ARE YOU?

            GOOD. HOW YOU DOING?
           AND SCOTT'S
        HOLDING UP A SIGN
            THAT SAYS
     "GO FOR THE $1 MILLION."

YOU KNOW, WE HAVE NOT GIVEN AWAY
        THE MILLION YET.
WELL, MAYBE IT'LL BE ME.
           WE WANT TO.
        YOU'VE GOT $5,000.

            YOU'VE GOT
      BOTH YOUR CHEATS LEFT.
    YOU'VE GOT YOUR SAVE LEFT.
    LET'S GO FOR THE MILLION.

         LET'S GIVE AWAY
        $1 MILLION TODAY.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
            STEPHANIE,
         PICK A SUBJECT.

 ALL RIGHT, SPENCER,
WHAT ARE YOUR WORST SUBJECTS?
                   MY WORST
             WOULD HAVE TO BE...
                    UH...

                WORLD HISTORY.
             AND I'M PRETTY GOOD
             AT EVERYTHING ELSE.
  HE SAID HE'S PRETTY GOOD AT
EVERYTHING EXCEPT WORLD HISTORY.

OKAY, THEN, WE WON'T CHOOSE
