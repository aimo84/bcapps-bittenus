     WHAT YOU THINKING, CLAY?
WELL, IF I START OUT IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE UNITED STATES
   AND I'M TRAVELING SOUTHEAST,
   I'M HEADING TOWARDS FLORIDA.

   AND IF I DO A COMPLETE 180,
      WHICH IS THE COMPLETE
       OPPOSITE DIRECTION,
           I AM HEADED
       TOWARDS WASHINGTON.

Foxworthy: LET ME EXPLAIN HOW
YOUR CLASSMATES CAN HELP YOU.
  YOU'VE GOT A PEEK
     AND A COPY.
YOU ALSO HAVE A SAVE,

     WHICH MEANS
IF YOU GUESS INCORRECTLY
AND YOUR CLASSMATE AT THE PODIUM

  YOU GET THE MONEY,
