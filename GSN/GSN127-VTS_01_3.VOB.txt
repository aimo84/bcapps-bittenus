        A PEEK AND A COPY.

    IS THAT RINGING ANY BELLS?
I THOUGHT IT WAS FALSE, TOO,

         HMM.
ACTUALLY, I WAS THINKING "AFT"
MEANT THE BACK OF A BOAT.

    TO THE FRONT OF A BOAT."

       AND I GOT BAD NEWS.
       UH-HUH.
           THE BAD NEWS
     IS YOU BURNED YOUR SAVE.

         THE GOOD NEWS IS
 THE 10-YEAR-OLD KID IS CORRECT.
       THE ANSWER IS FALSE.
            THE STERN
     IS THE BACK OF THE BOAT.

             THE BOW
    IS THE FRONT OF THE BOAT.
         AH.

     THERE'S ONE.
             "BECAUSE
