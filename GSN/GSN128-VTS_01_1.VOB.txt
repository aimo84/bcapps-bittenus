         IN THE WORLD,
    HERE COME THE NEWLYWEDS.
  Captioning provided by GSN.
   AND NOW, THE LADY WHO PUT
        THE FOX IN FOXY,

        SHERRI SHEPHERD.
            - HELLO.
           HI, GUYS.

              HI.
           NEWLYWEDS!
       HOW ARE YOU DOING?
             GOOD.

  ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU, GARY.
  WELCOME TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>
THE SHOW WHERE COUPLES GO PUBLIC
 WITH THEIR PRIVATE ENCOUNTERS

      AND WE GET TO WATCH.
         NOW LET'S MEET
      THE THREE NEWLYWEDS
         WHO ARE READY
        TO BARE IT ALL.

           - SHERRI,
    MEET COUPLE NUMBER ONE,
        TERRY AND KELLY.
      SHE'S A REPUBLICAN.
        HE'S A DEMOCRAT.

 ENGAGING IN POLITICAL DEBATES
   IS THEIR BIGGEST TURN-ON.
      NOW THAT'S THE KIND
   OF DIRTY POLITICS WE LOVE.
           [laughter]

       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
       CARLOS AND CHIARA,
  WERE DOING 70 ON THE HIGHWAY
   FROM TENNESSEE TO FLORIDA.
   HE WAS DOING THE DRIVING,

        AND SHE WAS, UH,
       DOING THE RIDING.
       WELL WORTH THE TEN
   TRAFFIC VIOLATIONS, KIDS.
    AND COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
      RUSSELL AND RACHEL.

   SHE WALKED DOWN THE AISLE
  TO THE THEME FROM <i>STAR WARS.</i>
   LUCKILY FOR THE GUESTS, HE
WAITED UNTIL AFTER THE CEREMONY
  TO PULL OUT HIS LIGHT SABER.

      BACK TO YOU, SHERRI.
     [cheers and applause]
      - WELCOME, COUPLES.
    GOOD LUCK TO ALL OF YOU.

   NOW, LADIES, I HAVE TO ASK
       THAT YOU STAND UP
       AND GO BACKSTAGE,
     BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ASK
         YOUR HUSBANDS

        A FEW QUESTIONS.
             YEAH.
        ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

       I'M GONNA ASK YOU
        THREE QUESTIONS,
      AND IT'S GONNA BE UP
         TO YOUR WIVES
     TO MATCH YOUR ANSWERS.

THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST POINTS
AT THE END OF THE GAME WILL WIN
 A FANTASTIC SECOND HONEYMOON.
     GENTLEMEN, YOU READY?

          HERE WE GO.
       ON YOUR FIRST DATE
     WITH YOUR SWEETHEART,
   YOU MUST HAVE BEEN MARKED

       WITH A BULL'S-EYE
     BECAUSE CUPID'S ARROW
    HIT YOU SQUARE IN THE...
          HEAD, HEART,
       OR NETHER REGIONS?

             TERRY.
  - UM, I'M GONNA ANSWER HEAD.
     - WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

     - BECAUSE THE PASSION
     STARTED WITH OUR FIRST
     BIG POLITICAL DEBATE.
  IT WAS ACTUALLY AN ARGUMENT
UNTIL ABOUT 3:00 IN THE MORNING,

     AND THEN I RECOGNIZED,
   SHE'S NOT JUST BEAUTIFUL,
    SHE'S GOT MORE GOING ON.
         - OH, UP HERE.

           I LOVE IT.
           ALL RIGHT.
    CARLOS, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - I'D HAVE TO SAY THE HEART.

         I'VE KNOWN HER
         SINCE I WAS 13
    AND HAD A CRUSH ON HER.
         AND IT WASN'T
  TILL WE WERE IN OUR LATE 20s

   THAT IT FINALLY HAPPENED.
  - WOW, THAT'S SO VERY COOL.
            RUSSELL.

       - I'D HAVE TO SAY
     DEFINITELY THE HEART.
         SHE WAS TRYING
     TO HOOK UP THAT NIGHT,
      BUT I WAS LIKE, "NO,
LET'S GO OUT, HAVE SOME DRINKS.

    LET'S HAVE A GOOD NIGHT
         ON THE TOWN."
    AND ACTUALLY FORCED HER
 TO GO THROUGH WITH A FULL DATE
INSTEAD OF JUST MESSING AROUND.

      - SO SHE WAS LOOKING
     FOR A ONE-NIGHT STAND,
     AND YOU SAID, "NO, NO,
  I WANT TO GET TO KNOW YOU"?
             - YES.
             - WOW!

         I DIDN'T THINK
   THOSE KIND OF MEN EXISTED.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--

   MY WIFE HAS MANY TALENTS,
  BUT SHE IS IN DESPERATE NEED
  OF THE BOOK <i>THE IDIOT'S GUIDE</i>
             <i>TO</i> BLANK.
            CARLOS.

  - <i>IDIOT'S GUIDE TO MEDICINE.</i>
    SHE'S TRYING TO GET INTO
THE FIELD OF MEDICINE RIGHT NOW
      AND SEEMS TO FORGET
        A LOT OF THINGS.

   - WHAT DOES SHE WANT TO BE
         IN THE FIELD?
       - SHE WANTS TO BE
    A PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANT.
   - AND SHE KEEPS FORGETTING
          EVERYTHING?

   - SOMETIMES, YEAH. I HAVE
 TO HELP HER WITH HER STUDYING.
     - SO <i>THE IDIOT'S GUIDE</i>
           <i>TO MEDICINE.</i>
      ALL RIGHT, RUSSELL,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

       - I'D HAVE TO SAY
  <i>THE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO COOKING.</i>
  SHE PREPARES AMAZING MEALS.
   LIKE, SHE ACTUALLY, LIKE,
          EVERY NIGHT,

SHE HAS AN AMAZING MEAL WAITING.
    BUT SHE ALWAYS COOKS IT
       A LITTLE TOO LONG
       AND IT JUST BURNS
         A LITTLE BIT.

AND, LIKE, AMAZING PREPARATION--
      JUST NEEDS TO LEARN
   WHEN TO TAKE THE HEAT OFF.
        - OKAY. GOT IT.
             TERRY.

  - SHE NEEDS <i>THE IDIOT'S GUIDE</i>
     <i>ON POLITICAL DECISIONS--</i>
            <i>POLITICS.</i>
    - OH, BECAUSE SHE'S NOT

     ON THE SAME PARTY LINE
            AS YOU.
- NO, SHE'S FROM A VERY STAUNCH
  FAMILY THE OTHER DIRECTION.
- ALL RIGHT, OUR FINAL QUESTION,
           GENTLEMEN.

     IF YOU WERE TO COMPILE
   A GREATEST HITS COLLECTION
   OF YOUR BEST SEXUAL ROMPS,
      WHICH WOULD YOU RATE
         AS NUMBER ONE?

            RUSSELL.
   - I'D PROBABLY HAVE TO GO
     WITH THE FIRST NIGHT.

  IT WAS JUST, LIKE, WE'D BEEN
 WANTING EACH OTHER FOR SO LONG
           AND LIKE--
      - NO, SHE WANTED YOU
     FROM THE FIRST NIGHT.

       YOU MADE HER WAIT.
          - I WANTED,
     BUT I WAS A GENTLEMAN.
     AND IT WAS JUST LIKE--
      IT WAS A HOT NIGHT.

   IT WAS A PASSIONATE NIGHT.
 IT WAS AN UNFORGETTABLE NIGHT
   THAT WE ALWAYS JUST THINK
         BACK ON LIKE,
"WOW, THAT WAS SOMETHING ELSE."

          - ALL RIGHT,
      SOMETHING TO BE SAID
       FOR WAITING, HUH?
       ALL RIGHT, TERRY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - WE WERE IN HAWAII
         AND WE WENT--
  DECIDED TO GO SKINNY-DIPPING
          ON A BEACH.
           [laughter]

   - CARLOS, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I'D HAVE TO SAY--
    WELL, WE LIVED IN PHILLY
     FOR A BIT, AND WE HAD
    TO KEEP EACH OTHER WARM,

 SO I'D HAVE TO SAY, YOU KNOW,
      OUR NIGHTS IN PHILLY
      ARE DEFINITELY SOME
     OF THE MOST MEMORABLE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    OKAY, FELLAS, NICE JOB.

      WHILE WE'RE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,
  GARY, I WANT YOU TO TELL US
ALL ABOUT THAT SECOND HONEYMOON
   THAT THEY'RE PLAYING FOR.

 - TONIGHT'S WINNERS ARE GOING
    TO LONG BAY BEACH RESORT
          AND VILLAS,
     AN ELITE ISLAND RESORT
           ON TORTOLA

 IN THE BRITISH VIRGIN ISLANDS,
    A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE SET
         THEIR OWN PACE
  AND EVERYTHING IS UNSPOILED,
     EXCEPT FOR THE GUESTS.

     LONG BAY BEACH RESORT.
      - AH, BEACH RESORT.
      THAT SOUNDS SO GOOD.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
 TO TRY TO MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

 EACH CORRECT ANSWER EARNS YOU
          FIVE POINTS,
         SO HERE WE GO.
   LADIES, ON HIS FIRST DATE
           WITH YOU,

       YOUR HUSBAND SAID
    HE MUST HAVE BEEN MARKED
       WITH A BULL'S-EYE
 BECAUSE CUPID'S ARROW HIT HIM
   SQUARE IN THE HEAD, HEART,
       OR NETHER REGIONS?

             KELLY.
       - UM, I WOULD SAY
       THAT CUPID HIT HIM
     STRAIGHT IN THE HEAD.

             - WHY?
- IT WAS MOSTLY OUR CONVERSATION
 OF POLITICS THAT CONNECTED US,
        SO I THINK THAT
   THAT'S THE WAY IT HIT HIM.

          - ALL RIGHT,
     AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - I SAID...
            - HEAD.
           - OH, YAY!
             - YES.

             - YAY!
            - YEAH.
       ALL RIGHT, CHIARA,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

         - I'M GONNA GO
    WITH THE NETHER REGIONS.
     - THE NETHER REGIONS.
    WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
   - 'CAUSE HE'S A LITTLE BIT
           OF A PERV.

           [laughter]
       - SO YOU SAY DOWN
  IN THE NETHER REGIONS, HUH?
   WHAT DID YOU SAY, CARLOS?
  - I ACTUALLY SAID THE HEART.

      - HE SAID THE HEART.
         - OH, MY GOD.
     - AND, CHIARA, IT WAS
   SO BEAUTIFUL WHAT HE SAID.
           - REALLY?
   - BECAUSE HE'S HAD A CRUSH

   ON YOU SINCE YOU WERE 15.
        - I'M SO SORRY.
     I JUST CALLED HIM OUT.
            - YEAH.

           ALL RIGHT.
            - SORRY.
 - RACHEL, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
    - I WOULD HAVE TO GUESS

      THAT MY HUSBAND SAID
        NETHER REGIONS.
            - YEAH?
        - WE ALWAYS HAD
     A LOT OF FUN TOGETHER.

       SO I WOULD SAY...
    - SO THE NETHER REGIONS.
       - NETHER REGIONS.
  - WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY?
       HE SAID THE HEART.

              all:
              AWW.
  - WELL, YOU'RE JUST A PIECE
            OF MEAT.
 I DON'T THINK TOO MANY PEOPLE
      WOULD BE COMPLAINING

        ABOUT THAT, HUH?
         - THAT'S TRUE.
            - OKAY.
    NEXT QUESTION, COUPLES.
  LADIES, HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

   MY WIFE HAS MANY TALENTS,
  BUT SHE IS IN DESPERATE NEED
          OF THE BOOK
    <i>THE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO</i> BLANK.

            CHIARA.
         - TECHNOLOGY?
      - IS THAT SOMETHING
           YOU'RE...

           - LACKING.
          - YEAH, WHY?
        - I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE JUST NEVER GOTTEN INTO IT.
     AND I'D RATHER, LIKE,
         WRITE A LETTER

      THAN WRITE AN EMAIL,
  AND HE JUST MAKES FUN OF ME,
   'CAUSE HE'S AN ARCHITECT,
AND HE'S ALWAYS ON THE COMPUTER.
     SO I CAN'T EVEN, LIKE,
  DO SOMETHING REALLY SIMPLE.

     SO HE MAKES FUN OF ME
         ALL THE TIME.
  - WHAT DID YOU SAY, CARLOS?
   - I SAID <i>THE IDIOT'S GUIDE</i>
           <i>TO MEDICINE.</i>

       <i>- THE IDIOT'S GUIDE</i>
         - OH, MY GOSH.
           [laughter]
          - ALL RIGHT.
    RACHEL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

       - UM, I WOULD SAY
  <i>THE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO RELAXING.</i>
 BECAUSE HE PROBABLY WOULD SAY
 THAT I NEED TO JUST CALM DOWN
       AND LEARN TO RELAX
       A LITTLE BIT MORE.

   - WHY AREN'T YOU RELAXING?
   - I'M JUST A VERY UPTIGHT,
     KIND OF SPASTIC PERSON

        JUST NATURALLY.
 - THAT'S WHY YOU WANTED TO HOP
          ON HIS BONES
        THE FIRST TIME.

         - I THINK SO.
      - JUST COULDN'T WAIT
    AND CALM YOURSELF DOWN.
            - YEAH.
- SO YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO--

        <i>THE IDIOT'S GUIDE</i>
           <i>TO RELAXING.</i>
  ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           <i>TO COOKING.</i>

              all:
              OOH!
            - UH-OH!
   - I'VE BEEN DOING SO WELL.
          - YOU HAVE.

       BUT YOU WANT TO BE
       SUCH A GREAT CHEF.
        YOU WANT TO BE,
 AND YOU'RE DOING A LOT BETTER.
        BUT, YOU KNOW...

      - ALL RIGHT, KELLY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
            - GOSH.
     THIS IS EASY, I THINK,
      'CAUSE HE WOULD LOVE
          TO SAY THIS.

  THAT I NEED THE DUMMY GUIDE
          TO POLITICS.
             - WHY?
      - BECAUSE HE THINKS
  THAT I'M ON THE WRONG SIDE.

  - OKAY, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
   YOU NEED THE DUMMY'S GUIDE
          TO POLITICS.
             YEAH.
             - WOW!

     - WE DO KNOW SOMETHING
       ABOUT EACH OTHER.
            - YEAH.
   - ABOUT ONE THING ANYHOW.
   - WOW, YOU GUYS DO AGREE.

         - OH, MY GOSH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
         OKAY, LADIES,
IF YOUR HUSBAND WERE TO COMPILE
   A GREATEST HITS COLLECTION

   OF YOUR BEST SEXUAL ROMPS,
      WHICH WOULD HE RATE
         AS NUMBER ONE?
            RACHEL.

    - OH, THAT'S A HARD ONE.
     NO INNUENDO INTENDED.
      I WOULD HAVE TO SAY

     PROBABLY OUR HONEYMOON
         WOULD BE SOME
   OF OUR BEST SEXUAL ROMPS.
       - YOUR HONEYMOON?
             - YES.
      - ANYTHING SPECIAL?

    - WE WENT TO BOTH FRANCE
          AND TURKEY,
      AND WHILE IN TURKEY,
WE WERE IN THE TOWN CAPPADOCIA,
    WHICH IS FULL OF CAVES,
             SO...

             - OOH.
       - CAVES WERE FUN.
     - WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
        THE FIRST NIGHT.

            I MEAN,
    THE FIRST NIGHT WAS HOT,
      BUT YOU GUYS DID IT
           IN A CAVE!
            - YEAH.
          - IT'S TRUE.

           IT'S TRUE.
   KELLY, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
    THE NIGHT ON THE BEACH.

        - WHAT HAPPENED
         ON THE BEACH?
    - WELL, WE PROBABLY GOT
  INTO SOME SORT OF DISCUSSION
     AND ENDED UP, I THINK,
       JUST GOING FOR IT.

      I THINK IT WAS CLOSE
          TO MIDNIGHT.
     WE WERE ON THE BEACH,
          AND I SAID,
      "IS IT BAD IF I WANT
  TO GET NAKED ON THE BEACH?"

     AND HE WAS LIKE, "NO."
    AND I RAN IN THE OCEAN,
           CAME BACK,
      AND THEN IT WAS ON.
       - WHERE WAS THIS?
      WHICH BEACH WAS IT?

     - SOMEWHERE IN HAWAII.
             - OHH.
  AND SO YOU GUYS WERE DOING--
 HAVING A POLITICAL DISCUSSION

 AND YOU END UP GETTING NAKED?
           - ALWAYS.
            ALWAYS.
       - THAT JUST SOUNDS
       RIGHT ABOUT RIGHT
         WITH POLITICS.

 - SEE, IF EVERYBODY JUST THREW
       IN SOME NAKEDNESS,
        THEN I THINK...
           [laughter]
     - I DON'T KNOW, GIRL.
A LOT OF THESE POLITICIANS HAVE.

  THAT'S WHY THEY KEEP GETTING
          IN TROUBLE.
     THROWING IN THE NAK...
    [laughter and applause]

   SO YOU GOT A LITTLE NAKED
         IN THE WATER.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        - THERE YOU GO.
    HAWAIIAN SKINNY-DIPPING.

              YES.
          YOU GOT IT.
         - OH, MY GOD.
             YEAH.
           [applause]

      - ALL RIGHT, CHIARA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
     HOW YOU INTRODUCED US.
 WE WERE DRIVING FROM TENNESSEE
       BACK HOME TO MIAMI

    ON THE FLORIDA TURNPIKE
    GOING 70 MILES AN HOUR.
             - WOW.
         HOW WAS THAT?
           - I JUST--
          I TRUST HIM,

     SO WHENEVER HE'S LIKE,
  "THIS WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA,"
   I JUST WENT ALONG WITH IT.
             AND...
   - ON THE FLORIDA TURNPIKE
        GOING 70 MILES--

   WHO THE HELL WAS WATCHING
           THE ROAD?
  YOU ARE A GREAT MULTITASKER,
        I'VE GOT TO SAY.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

 HE SAID YOUR NIGHTS IN PHILLY.
    - OUR NIGHTS IN PHILLY.
    - OUR NIGHTS IN PHILLY?
            REALLY?

           [laughter]
   - CHIARA, DO YOU REMEMBER
    THOSE NIGHTS IN PHILLY?
 - YEAH, BUT IT WAS IN OUR BED
       IN THE APARTMENT.

           IT WASN'T
 LIKE CRAZY, ADVENTUROUS STUFF.
    - SHE DIDN'T SAY CRAZY.
             - OH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
           ALL RIGHT.

 WELL, LET'S SEE WHERE WE ARE.
       COUPLE NUMBER ONE,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 15 POINTS.
     YOU'RE IN FIRST PLACE.

  COUPLE NUMBER TWO AND THREE,
 YOU DON'T HAVE ANY POINTS YET,
         BUT IT'S OKAY,
        WE GOT A WHILE.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN

      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,
        AND, THIS TIME,
     WE DOUBLED THE POINTS,
     SO KEEP IT RIGHT HERE.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       IT IS TIME FOR YOU

   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
   THESE NEXT THREE QUESTIONS
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
          HERE WE GO.

       LADIES, SPILL IT.
   WHAT IS THE HOTTEST THING
        ABOUT YOUR MAN--
           HIS MIND,

           HIS BODY,
         OR HIS SMILE?
             KELLY.
          - HIS MIND.
        WITHOUT A DOUBT.

          - HIS MIND?
           HIS MIND.
            CHIARA.
          - HIS SMILE.

          - HIS SMILE?
 WHAT DOES HIS SMILE DO TO YOU?
 - 'CAUSE IT'S WHAT I REMEMBER
       EVER SINCE WE WERE
        IN EIGHTH GRADE.

 HE HAD THIS SMILE THAT WOULD,
   LIKE, LIGHT UP THE HALLS.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    RACHEL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - I WOULD ALSO HAVE
      TO GO WITH HIS MIND.
 THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT
 INITIALLY ATTRACTED ME TO HIM.
     HE'S JUST VERY SMART,
        AND HE'S ALSO--

        HE ALSO HAS THAT
    HEART OF GOLD WHERE HE--
    HE'S ALSO VERY OUTGOING
         AND GREGARIOUS
          AND AMIABLE,
  AND JUST ANYONE WHO HE MEETS

         AND TALKS TO,
   HE CAN KIND OF RELATE TO,
    SO IT REALLY DREW ME IN.
- OH, I CAN JUST SEE THAT LOVE.

             LOOK.
           ALL RIGHT.
            LADIES,
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
    IF YOU ASKED OUR FRIENDS

WHAT IS THE MOST ANNOYING THING
     ABOUT US AS A COUPLE,
   THEY WOULD DEFINITELY SAY
          IT IS BLANK.

            CHIARA.
    - WE'RE ALWAYS LAUGHING
         ALL THE TIME.
     AND PEOPLE JUST THINK
       WE'RE REALLY SILLY

    AND KIND OF RIDICULOUS.
           - UH-HUH.
           - WE JUST
    ARE CONSTANTLY LAUGHING,
  AND PEOPLE CAN'T UNDERSTAND
        WHAT'S SO FUNNY,

     BUT I GUESS IT'S LIKE
   OUR PERSONAL LITTLE JOKES.
    - 'CAUSE YOU WERE LIKE,
    "WE WERE ON THE FREEWAY
        ON THE TURNPIKE
    AT 70, AND WE SURVIVED."

         THAT IS CRAZY.
             OKAY.
   SO YOU'RE ALWAYS LAUGHING.
            - YEAH.
           - GOT YOU.
            RACHEL.

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
       PROBABLY THE FACT
          THAT WE POST
       A LOT OF PICTURES
  OF OURSELVES ONLINE KISSING

     AND BEING VERY CUTESY.
           - GOT YOU.
     KELLY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I DON'T KNOW IF ANYONE'S
    EVER EXPRESSED ANYTHING

      TO US ABOUT US BEING
        REALLY ANNOYING,
     BUT IF I HAD TO GUESS,
         I WOULD GUESS
    MAYBE THEY WOULD FIND IT
            ANNOYING

  THAT WE'RE SO HAPPY IN LOVE,
           YOU KNOW,
         ALL THE TIME.
          - ALL RIGHT.
LADIES, SINCE YOU SAID, "I DO,"

        HOW MUCH WEIGHT
   HAS YOUR HUSBAND PUT ON--
 ENOUGH TO FIT IN A FANNY PACK,
          A KNAPSACK,
        OR A DUFFEL BAG?

            RACHEL.
 - I WOULD SAY THE FANNY PACK.
       - THE FANNY PACK?
     - THE SMALLEST AMOUNT.
              YES.

             YEAH.
         OKAY, GOT YOU.
             KELLY.
     - I GUESS I WOULD SAY
       THE SMALL AMOUNT.

       - THE FANNY PACK?
       - THE FANNY PACK.
         OKAY. GOT YOU.
         - FANNY PACK.
           - CHIARA.

          FANNY PACK?
 - WE GOT MARRIED A MONTH AGO,
   SO HE HASN'T HAD MUCH TIME
    TO GAIN A LOT OF WEIGHT.
             SO...
- YEAH, ESPECIALLY JUST DRIVING

AROUND ON THE FREEWAY TURNPIKE.
     THAT'D MAKE YOU--JUST
YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM LOSE WEIGHT.
       ALL RIGHT, HERE IS
  OUR BONUS QUESTION, LADIES.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
      ANSWER THIS QUESTION
      ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

  BLANK NEEDS MORE AFFECTION,
  AND BLANK NEEDS MORE SPACE.
             KELLY.

 - TERRY NEEDS MORE AFFECTION,
    AND, UM...I USUALLY LIKE
      A LITTLE MORE SPACE.
            - OKAY.
    CHIARA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - HE NEEDS MORE AFFECTION,
     AND I NEED MORE SPACE.
            - OKAY.
    RACHEL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - I WOULD SAY--
 I'M GONNA DO A REVERSAL HERE.
      I THINK I'M THE ONE
    WHO NEEDS MORE AFFECTION
          AND HE NEEDS
    A LITTLE BIT MORE SPACE.

           - UH-HUH.
  - AND I'M GOING TO SAY THAT
       BECAUSE MY HUSBAND
          REALLY LOVES
 TO PLAY A LOT OF VIDEO GAMES.
             - YES.

       - I'M ALWAYS LIKE,
         OH, YOU KNOW,
       TRYING TO PULL HIM
        OFF THE COMPUTER
     AND GET MORE AFFECTION
            AT TIME.

      - ALL RIGHT, GREAT.
       THANK YOU SO MUCH,
            LADIES.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
        WE'RE GONNA SEE

       IF THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
         STAY WITH US.
  - AND FOR MORE <i>NEWLYWED GAME,</i>

        GO TO GSNTV.COM.
       AND NOW YOUR HOST,
        SHERRI SHEPHERD.
       - THANK YOU, GARY.

           ALL RIGHT,
       THE GUYS ARE BACK.
          SO LET'S SEE
      IF THE MEN CAN MATCH
     WHAT THE LADIES SAID.

        HERE'S THE FIRST
  OF OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
      GENTLEMEN, WE ASKED
     YOUR WIFE TO SPILL IT.
        WHAT DID SHE SAY
IS THE HOTTEST THING ABOUT YOU--

     YOUR MIND, YOUR BODY,
         OR YOUR SMILE?
            - TERRY.

      - I'LL GO WITH MIND.
     I THINK SHE SAID MIND.
            - MIND.
     AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?

            - WHOO!
          NICE, BABY.

      - ALL RIGHT, CARLOS,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE
       TO GO WITH SMILE.
   SHE'S ALWAYS COMPLIMENTED
  MY SMILE SINCE I WAS YOUNG.

       SO I'M GONNA HAVE
        TO GO WITH THAT.
            - LOOK.
           HIS SMILE.
     [cheers and applause]

          - ALL RIGHT.
       THAT'S ONE WE GOT.
       - AS YOU FLASH IT
            FOR HER.
             OKAY.

    RUSSELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
            MY MIND.
 - AND WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

    - WE MET IN PERSON, BUT
 THE ROMANCE BLOSSOMED ONLINE,
   GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER
           REMOTELY.
 SO WE REALLY GOT TO KNOW EACH
OTHER ON AN INTELLECTUAL LEVEL.

    - AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        both: HIS MIND.
             - AWW.
     [cheers and applause]

          - ALL RIGHT,
     HERE WE GO, GENTLEMEN.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
    IF YOU ASKED OUR FRIENDS
WHAT IS THE MOST ANNOYING THING

     ABOUT US AS A COUPLE,
   THEY WOULD DEFINITELY SAY
          IT IS BLANK.
  WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, CARLOS?

    - OUR CUTENESS TOGETHER?
     YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALWAYS
   KIND OF KISSING EACH OTHER
    AND LOOKING EACH OTHERS
    IN THE EYE AND WHATNOT,

SO PERHAPS THAT MAY BE PATHETIC
            TO SOME.
     - NOT PATHETIC AT ALL.
       I THINK IT'S CUTE.
      - ALL RIGHT, WELL...

      - ALL RIGHT, CHIARA,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     WE'RE ALWAYS LAUGHING.
     NO, WE CAN'T TAKE IT.
        - THE CUTENESS,

      LAUGHING, GIGGLING,
     IT'S KIND OF THE SAME.
        - NO. HE SAID--
  NO, HE DIDN'T SAY LAUGHING.
            - SORRY.
            - OKAY.

    WHAT ABOUT YOU, RUSSELL?
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
    WITH HIS ANSWER AS WELL.
SORT OF OUR NAUSEATING CUTENESS
     THAT WE'RE JUST ALWAYS

     LIKE, "OOH-LOOH-LOOH."
 KIND OF LIKE A LITTLE ANNOYING
    AND NAUSEATING AT TIMES.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  RACHEL, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

  - I WAS A BIT MORE SPECIFIC.
    - WE POSTED KISSY PHOTOS
            ONLINE.
             - OHH.

     - AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - I'M GONNA GO WITH NOTHING.
          - ALL RIGHT.
  - I DON'T THINK OUR FRIENDS

       FIND US ANNOYING.
- OKAY. KELLY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - THAT WAS WHAT I SAID,
       BUT THEN I THOUGHT
 I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER, WHICH
WAS THAT WE'RE SO HAPPY IN LOVE.

WHAT THE OTHER TWO GUYS GUESSED.
             - UGH!
           [laughter]
            - OKAY.

   GENTLEMEN, SINCE YOU SAID,
            "I DO,"
 HOW MUCH WEIGHT DID YOUR WIVES
      SAY YOU'VE PUT ON--
 ENOUGH TO FIT IN A FANNY PACK,

          A KNAPSACK,
        OR A DUFFEL BAG?
   WHAT DO YOU SAY, RUSSELL?
        - I'D HAVE TO GO
      WITH THE FANNY PACK,

       'CAUSE WE ACTUALLY
 KIND OF LOST EVEN SOME WEIGHT
       SINCE THE WEDDING,
              SO--
 AND NOT BECAUSE OF THE COOKING
THAT I WAS JOKING ABOUT EARLIER,

            BUT JUST
   WE'VE BEEN STAYING ACTIVE.
        WE GOT A PUPPY.
  THE PUPPY KEEPS YOU RUNNING
        AROUND THE CITY
         ALL THE TIME,

       SO I'D HAVE TO GO
   WITH THE SMALLEST AMOUNT,
        THE FANNY PACK.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   RACHEL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     - I SAID A FANNY PACK.
        - A FANNY PACK.
             - AW.
      - AND, MISS RACHEL,
   IT'S NOT FROM THE COOKING.

           ALL RIGHT.
   WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, TERRY?
     - I'VE ACTUALLY GOTTEN
        IN BETTER SHAPE,
       TRYING TO GIVE HER
        THE BEST OF ME.

            - YEAH?
     OH, THAT'S INCRE--OH!
    KELLY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      both: A FANNY PACK.
           [applause]

      - ALL RIGHT, CARLOS,
   WITH THE BEAUTIFUL SMILE.
    - I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE
             TO SAY
         WE'RE ALL FANS
       OF THE FANNY PACK.

      - AND WHY DO YOU SAY
          FANNY PACK?
   - WELL, WE'VE BEEN MARRIED
       ABOUT TWO MONTHS,
     AND WE MOVED UP HERE,
      AND I'VE BEEN DOING

A LOT OF WALKING AND DON'T THINK
       MUCH HAS CHANGED.
            - OKAY.
            CHIARA.
          FANNY PACK.

           [applause]

           GENTLEMEN,
      ARE YOU READY TO GO?
            - READY.
    - ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

      WHEN YOU FIRST SKIED
        DOWN THE SLOPES
       OF LOVE TOGETHER,
         WAS YOUR WIFE
     A BUNNY HILL BEGINNER,

      A SEASONED SKI BUM,
         OR BODE MILLER
           IN A BRA?
             JAKE?

     BODE MILLER IN A BRA.
         - OH, REALLY?
         - ABSOLUTELY.
       SHE--SHE HAD BEEN
       THROUGH THE RINGER

       A COUPLE OF TIMES,
           AND, UH--
            - YEAH?
            GOTCHA.
      - WE CAME OUT BETTER
       ON THE OTHER SIDE.

   - AND SHE CAME OUT BETTER
           ALL RIGHT.
    ROBERT, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - I'M GONNA SAY
     A SEASONED, UH, SKIER.
      - A SEASONED SKIER?
           - MM-HMM.
  - YEAH, WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

         - UH, SHE'S--
       I KNOW SHE--WHO--
       SHE'S BEEN AROUND,
   SO, UH, YOU KNOW, SHE'S--
            I KNOW.

          - SHE KNOWS
       WHAT SHE'S DOING.
      - AND YOU LIKE THAT.
        - MM-HMM, A LOT.

    - KEVIN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
      A SEASONED SKI BUM.
SHE DEFINITELY, DEFINITELY KNOWS
       WHAT SHE'S DOING.

            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.
  - THAT'S WHY YOU GOT A SMILE
         ON YOUR FACE?
         - YOU KNOW IT.
          - ALL RIGHT.

   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
    IF YOU WERE A SUPERHERO,
       WHAT SPECIAL POWER
     WOULD YOU WANT TO HAVE

   TO MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER?
            ROBERT?
            - UH...

        STAMINA, MAYBE?
     - YOU DON'T HAVE THAT?
    - I DON'T HAVE THAT, NO.

     I COME HOME FROM WORK,
     I'M READY TO PASS OUT.
   I CAN'T DO ANYTHING THERE
          AFTER WORK.
      - SO STAMINA WOULD--
       - SO TIRED, YEAH.

       - STAMINA WOULD BE
        THE THING, OKAY.
             KEVIN?
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
          SUPER SPEED.

            - WHAT--
    WHAT ABOUT SUPER SPEED?
       - I'VE ALWAYS GOT
      LOTS OF CHORES TO DO
        AROUND THE HOUSE
AND RUNNING HERE, RUNNING THERE.

        AND TO DO IT ALL
        NICE AND QUICK.
  - BUT NOT ABOUT LOVEMAKING?
       - OH, NO, NO, NO.
  - OKAY, JUST YOUR REGULAR--

    - I'D TURN IT OFF THEN.
        - OKAY, SO JUST
       THE REGULAR STUFF.
             JAKE?

         - UH, GOTTA GO
       WITH X-RAY VISION.

         $1 PER MINUTE,
    HOW MUCH WOULD THAT RIDE
           COST YOU?

             KEVIN?
          - ABOUT $15.
      - ABOUT $15, OR $50?

           - [laughs]
              $15.
             - $15.
            - YEAH.

YOU THAN YOU CAN BEAR, YOU KNOW.

             - $15.
           - GOT YOU.
             JAKE?

      WITH ABOUT 60 BUCKS.
       - 60 BUCKS, YEAH?
            - YEAH.
        YEAH, YOU KNOW,
   YOU GOTTA DRAW THINGS OUT.

            ENJOY IT
     WHILE YOU'RE DOING IT.
      - YEAH, I HEAR YOU.
 - OTHERWISE, WHAT'S THE POINT?
        - 60 BUCKS, WOW.

            ROBERT?
       - I WOULD SAY $5.

             - $5?
             - $5.
        THAT'S JUST WHEN
   THEY PULL THE METER DOWN.

        IT ISN'T EVEN--
             - HEY.
  - YOU HAVEN'T EVEN LEFT YET.
     - WE GET THE JOB DONE,
   AND HEY, WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

          - ALL RIGHT.
      I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
   WHEN YOUR WIFE COMES BACK.
  FELLAS, YOU DID A GREAT JOB.

    AND WHILE WE'RE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,
       GARY, TELL US ALL
  ABOUT THAT SECOND HONEYMOON
      THEY'RE PLAYING FOR.

         - HOW MUCH FUN
      DOES ANTIGUA SOUND?
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS.

     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
        TO TRY AND MATCH
         THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
       EARNS FIVE POINTS.

          HERE WE GO.
  LADIES, WHEN YOU FIRST SKIED
        DOWN THE SLOPES
       OF LOVE TOGETHER,

        DID YOUR HUSBAND
          SAY YOU WERE
     A BUNNY HILL BEGINNER,
      A SEASONED SKI BUM,

         OR BODE MILLER
           IN A BRA?
            REBECCA?
      - I WAS BODE MILLER
           IN A BRA.

            - GIRL!
          - I MET HIM,
     AND I KNEW IMMEDIATELY
  I WAS READY FOR EVERYTHING.

       NOTHING SCARED ME.
     I WAS THE ONE SAYING,
        "LET'S DO THIS."
            - YEAH.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

     BODE MILLER IN A BRA.
         THAT IS GREAT.
       ALL RIGHT, TIANA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

         - I'M GONNA GO
       WITH THE SEASONED,
          JUST 'CAUSE
    BEFORE WE GOT TOGETHER,
           YOU KNOW,
   I WAS SEEING SOME PEOPLE.

   HE WAS SEEING SOME PEOPLE.
    SO I HAD SOME EXPERIENCE
       WHEN WE FIRST MET,
        SO I'M GONNA GO
         WITH SEASONED.

      - SEASONED SKI BUM.
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, ROBERT?
      A SEASONED SKI BUM.
            - WHOO.

            - YEAH.
             OKAY.
   JENNIFER, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - I THINK I TOOK
    MY HUSBAND'S BREATH AWAY
      FROM THE BEGINNING.
        SO I'M GONNA GO
   WITH BODE MILLER IN A BRA.

    - BODE MILLER IN A BRA.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       SEASONED SKI BUM.
         NEXT QUESTION.

    LADIES, IF YOUR HUSBAND
        WAS A SUPERHERO,
       WHAT SPECIAL POWER
         WOULD HE WANT
    TO MAKE HIS LIFE EASIER?

             TIANA?
       - UM, I'D SAY FLY,
   BECAUSE HE HATES DRIVING,
  AND HE CAN GO FROM ONE PLACE
   TO ANOTHER REALLY QUICKLY.

        - OKAY, ROBERT,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - I SAID STAMINA.
           - STAMINA.
            - I'M--
  - I'M NOT GONNA GUESS THAT.

        - I DON'T KNOW.
       I'M ALWAYS TIRED.
      - WHO PICKS STAMINA?
  - I DON'T KNOW, I COULDN'T--
 - WHAT SUPERHERO HAS STAMINA?

      - IT'S TRUE, NO ONE.
     - AND WHAT'D YOU SAY,
           JENNIFER?
   - WELL, I THINK MY HUSBAND
      IS A VERY BUSY MAN,

      AND HE HAS A HISTORY
    OF TROUBLE WITH DRIVING,
   SO I'M GONNA GO WITH FLY.
          - WITH FLY?

     OKAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
          SUPER SPEED.
     - WELL, IT'S SIMILAR.
            - OKAY.

    REBECCA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         - AT THE RISK
      OF BEING UNORIGINAL,
   HE IS SUCH A MULTITASKER,

    AND I THINK HE'D BE ABLE
      TO BE IN MORE PLACES
         DURING THE DAY
        IF HE COULD FLY.
       - IF HE COULD FLY?
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?

         X-RAY VISION.
     I WANT YOU TO EXPLAIN
     WHY YOUR HUSBAND SAID

            - UM...
         I THINK MAYBE
       INSTEAD OF EASIER,
       HE WAS JUST TRYING
    TO MAKE HIS LIFE BETTER.

          - ALL RIGHT.
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION,
            COUPLES.
   IF YOUR LAST ROMANTIC ROMP
           TOOK PLACE

     IN THE BACK OF A TAXI,
          AND THE FARE
    WAS $1 PER EACH MINUTE,
 HOW MUCH DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
   THAT RIDE WOULD COST YOU?

           JENNIFER?
        - I'LL SAY $30.
          - $30, YEAH?
             - $30.

    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, HUBBY?
              $15.
        SHE'S GOT A LOT
        OF FAITH IN YOU.

     - MAYBE I'M GIVING HIM
   A LITTLE TOO MUCH CREDIT.
      I GUESS I HAVE TO BE
A LITTLE MORE HONEST NEXT TIME.
           - NO, NO.

         [audience ohs]
          NO, NO, NO.
    KEEP IT AT THE $30 MARK.

      HE'LL GET UP TO IT.
YOU JUST GOTTA PUT IT OUT THERE.
      - YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.
        - OKAY, REBECCA,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

    - I'M GONNA GO WITH $60.
          - WITH $60?
    - IT'S A HAPPY MARRIAGE.
            - WHOO!
              $60!

         THAT'S, LIKE,
     A LONG WAYS AND BACK.
       - I KNOW, I KNOW.
    I'M TRYING TO BE HONEST.

    - WHOO, ALL RIGHT, JAKE,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?
              $60!
     [cheers and applause]

             WHOO!
      TIANA, NO PRESSURE.
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - I'M GONNA SAY $10.
             - $10?
  NOW, WHY WOULD YOU SAY $10?
    - 'CAUSE WHEN WE DO IT,
      WE GET RIGHT TO IT.

 - WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, ROBERT?
          - IT WAS $5.
             - $5.
             WHAT--
    YOU GUYS ARE NEWLYWEDS.

           WHAT IS IT
    WITH THE $5 AND THE $10?
      - WE'VE BEEN DATING
FOR A LONG TIME BEFORE, SO IT--
 - OKAY, ALL RIGHT, SO MAYBE--
          - VERY TRUE.

       - OKAY, I GOT YOU.
           ALL RIGHT.
   AT THE END OF THIS ROUND,
        CONGRATULATIONS
      TO JAKE AND REBECCA.

       YOU'RE IN THE LEAD

 ALL RIGHT, LADIES, IT IS TIME

       FOR YOU TO ANSWER
        SOME QUESTIONS.
        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
          HERE WE GO.

   LADIES, WE KNOW YOU THINK
          HE'S A GEM.
         BUT WHAT PART
     OF YOUR HUSBAND'S BODY
   DO YOU WISH HE WOULD SPEND
   JUST A BIT MORE TIME ON--

           HIS HAIR,
           HIS FEET,
          OR SOMETHING
      IN BETWEEN THE TWO?

            REBECCA?
          - HIS FEET.
          - HIS FEET?
 - YEAH, HE HAS ADORABLE FEET,
       BUT HE WILL NOT--

       HE THINKS SOMEHOW
THAT PEDICURES ARE EMASCULATING.
   HE WON'T--HE WON'T DO IT.
          - DO YOU TRY
   AND DO SOMETHING YOURSELF?

  - HE WON'T LET ME NEAR THEM.
       - HE WON'T LET YOU
         NEAR HIS FEET?
        - HE'S TICKLISH.
       - GOT YOU. TIANA?

         - I'M GONNA GO
       WITH HIS FEET TOO.
           - MM-HMM?
 - UM, HE SPENDS A LOT OF TIME
          ON HIS HAIR.

          HE WORKS OUT
         ALL THE TIME.
   HIS FEET, INSTEAD OF USING
       TOENAIL CLIPPERS,
        HE'LL SIT THERE
    AND, LIKE, RIP THEM OFF.

        AND I HATE THAT.
    - HE JUST RIPS 'EM OFF.
            - YEAH.
    - WOW, THERE'S SOMETHING

      A LITTLE CREEPY SEXY
          ABOUT THAT.
          I LIKE THAT.
   JENNIFER, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - I'M DEFINITELY
  GONNA HAVE TO GO WITH FEET,
    BECAUSE MY HUSBAND LIKES
    HIS FEET TAKEN CARE OF.
       HE LIKES PEDICURES
         AND ALL THAT,

      BUT ONLY IF I DO IT
            FOR HIM.
    SO I WISH HE WOULD SPEND
 A LITTLE MORE TIME DOING THAT.
I OFTEN WONDER WHAT IT WAS LIKE
     BEFORE I CAME AROUND.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
      IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
 WE'LL BE RUNNING OUT OF BLANK

         ANYTIME SOON,
            BECAUSE
    FOR SOME STRANGE REASON,
WE HAVE AN OBSCENE AMOUNT OF IT
         IN OUR HOUSE.

             TIANA?
   - I'LL GO WITH CAT TREATS.
            - YEAH?
     YOU GOT A LOT OF CATS?

    - WE HAVE BAGS AND BAGS
         OF CAT TREATS
        FROM HIS MOTHER
   AND, LIKE, WHEN WE GO OUT,
    AND THEY'RE JUST SITTING
     IN OUR LAUNDRY ROOM--

     BAGS AND BAGS OF THEM.
     - ALL RIGHT, JENNIFER?
 - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY MILK,
    AS FUNNY AS THAT SOUNDS,

       BECAUSE I'M A BIG
         MILK DRINKER,
    AND IT'S AN ONGOING JOKE
          IN OUR HOUSE
        THAT EVERY DAY,
    MY HUSBAND IS GOING OUT

       TO GET ME A GALLON
            OF MILK.
       SO IT'S VERY RARE
 THAT WE WOULD RUN OUT OF MILK
         IN OUR HOUSE.

         - OKAY, MILK.
            REBECCA?
        - PEANUT BUTTER.
            - YEAH?
     - WE--EVERY TIME WE'RE
     AT THE GROCERY STORE,

          "ARE WE OUT
       OF PEANUT BUTTER?"
       AT ANY GIVEN TIME,
      WE'VE GOT FOUR JARS
   SOMEWHERE IN OUR KITCHEN.

    - NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
     WHAT IS THE ONE THING
  YOUR HUSBAND DOES CONSTANTLY
THAT MAKES YOU JUST LOOK AT HIM
      AND SAY, "WHATEVER"?

           JENNIFER?
      - MY HUSBAND WATCHES
        WAY TOO MUCH TV.
    SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
       WITH TOO MUCH TV.

   EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND,
       THERE'S A NEW SHOW
        HE HAS TO WATCH.
           - REBECCA?

- HE'S CONSTANTLY REDECORATING.
        HE GETS AN IDEA
      IN HIS HOUSE THAT--
  OR IN HIS HEAD, THAT WE HAVE
    TO REDECORATE THE HOUSE.

   WE HAVE TO MOVE THE COUCH.
   WE HAVE TO MOVE THE DESK.
      BUT HE HAS TO START
          IMMEDIATELY.
 YOU KNOW, SO IF YOU'RE SITTING
 ON THE COUCH, YOU BETTER MOVE.

         - FORGET IT--
      HE'S PICKING YOU UP
    WHETHER YOU'RE ON THERE
            OR NOT.
      - IT'S AN OBSESSION.
            - TIANA?

       - ROB IS OBSESSED
      WITH FANTASY SPORTS.
  HE'LL PLAY FANTASY FOOTBALL,
         FANTASY GOLF.
   HE DOESN'T EVEN PLAY GOLF.

        HE WATCHES NAS--
        FANTASY NASCAR.
  HE PLAYS EVERY FANTASY SPORT
           THERE IS.
SO I WOULD DEFINITELY SAY THAT.
          - OKEYDOKE.

        ALL RIGHT, NOW,
   HERE'S OUR BONUS QUESTION.
      THIS HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

            LADIES,
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
     THE MOST MODERN THING
       ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE
      IS DEFINITELY BLANK,

WHILE THE MOST TRADITIONAL THING
           IS BLANK.
            REBECCA?
         - I WOULD SAY
     THE MOST MODERN THING

     IS HOW SENSITIVE HE IS
          AND HOW MUCH
 OF AN EQUAL PARTNERSHIP IT IS.
  WE'RE OLD-FASHIONED, THOUGH,
  ABOUT HOW MUCH HE SPOILS ME.

   - HE DOES SPOIL YOU A LOT?
  - HE SPOILS ME. YOU KNOW, HE
BUYS ME JUST FUNNY LITTLE THINGS
    THAT HE THINKS I'D LIKE.
            - YEAH?

          - YOU KNOW,
  HE COMES UP WITH SURPRISES.
    HE MAKES ME DINNER WHEN
I'M TIRED COMING HOME FROM WORK.
          I'M SPOILED.

            - OKAY.
        THAT'S SO SWEET.
             TIANA?
         - I WOULD SAY
     THE MOST MODERN THING

     IS THAT I'M IN CHARGE
         OF THE MONEY.
       USUALLY, YOU KNOW,
       MEN ARE IN CHARGE.
          I TAKE CARE
       OF ALL THE BILLS.

         I'M IN CHARGE
       OF ALL THE MONEY.
 AND THE MOST TRADITIONAL THING
     WOULD BE THAT I COOK.
            - OKAY.
           JENNIFER?

         - I WOULD SAY
     THE MOST MODERN THING
        ABOUT OUR FAMILY
    IS ALSO THAT I TAKE CARE
       OF ALL THE BILLS.

         I KIND OF MAKE
    THE FINANCIAL DECISIONS
    AND KIND OF FILL HIM IN
 WHEN HE NEEDS TO BE FILLED IN.
     BUT ON THE SAME TOKEN,
  I'M YOUR TYPICAL HOUSEWIFE,

       COOKING, CLEANING,
    AND TAKING CARE OF HIM,
        LIKE THE TYPICAL
       1950s WIFE WOULD.
          - I LOVE IT.
   THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES.

        WHEN WE RETURN,
        WE'RE GONNA SEE
        IF THE HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
         DON'T GO AWAY.

    ROBERT, YOU'RE THINKING,
      THINKING, THINKING.
        - I AM THINKING.
        BUT I WOULD SAY
         MY FEET ALSO,

      BECAUSE THEY SMELL,
           OF COURSE.
    GUYS' FEET ALWAYS SMELL.
            COME ON.
       - YEAH, THAT IS--
            THEY DO.

       - AND I ALWAYS SIT
          ON THE COUCH
      AND PICK MY TOENAILS
         ALL THE TIME,
       AND SHE HATES IT.
        OH, SHE HATES--

      AND I--'CAUSE I JUST
     LEAVE 'EM THERE, TOO,
     WHEN I PICK, AND IT--
           - NOT ONLY
    YOU PICK YOUR TOENAILS,

      YOU LEAVE 'EM THERE?
      - I LEAVE 'EM THERE,
           TOO, YEAH.
 - SO IF YOUR WIFE SITS ON 'EM,
     THEY POKE HER IN THE--

        - YEAH, UH-HUH.
   - WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY?
           YOUR FEET.
          - WHOO-HOO.
     [cheers and applause]

         - OKAY, KEVIN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - GONNA HAVE TO GO
     WITH THE FEET AS WELL.
             - WHY?

  - UH, SOMETIMES MY TOENAILS
        GET A LITTLE BIT
         OUT OF CONTROL
       AND SLICE HER LEGS
  IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

        - THIS IS TRUE.
         - SO IT'S LIKE
  SHE'S SLEEPING WITH A BEAR?
         - PRETTY MUCH.

       - WHAT DO YOU SAY?
          - HIS FEET.
          - YOUR FEET.
            - YEAH.
    THAT'S RIGHT, BABY GIRL.

           - UH-HUH.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?

      IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
 WE'LL BE RUNNING OUT OF BLANK
         ANYTIME SOON,
BECAUSE FOR SOME STRANGE REASON,

WE HAVE AN OBSCENE AMOUNT OF IT
          IN OUR HOME.
            ROBERT?
        - CLEAN CLOTHES.

        SHE DOES LAUNDRY
         ALL THE TIME.
            - YEAH?
       - SO I WOULD SAY--
    - SO IT'S CLEAN CLOTHES?
             - YES.

    - TIANA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
          CAT TREATS.
             - AH.
        - HOW MANY BAGS
       OF HOMER'S TREATS

           DO WE HAVE
      IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM?
    - KEVIN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - WELL, I'VE GOT
        A DVD COLLECTION

    THAT'S ABOUT 600 MOVIES,
         GOING STRONG.
  AND, UH, SHE'S NOT TOO HAPPY
            WITH IT.
     SO I THINK SHE THINKS
    IT'S AN OBSCENE AMOUNT.

    SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
            MOVIES.
          - ALL RIGHT,
      AND WHAT'D YOU SAY?
            - MILK.

       - SHE DRINKS A TON
            OF MILK.
    - I THINK WE PRACTICALLY
OWN STOCK IN THE MILK INDUSTRY,
        SO I DON'T KNOW
      WHAT HE'S THINKING.

      I THOUGHT TO MYSELF,
    "IF HE DOESN'T GET MILK,
         HE'S SLEEPING
    SOMEWHERE ELSE TONIGHT,"
 SO YOU BETTER REDEEM YOURSELF.
             - OH.

         - OH, MY GOSH.
      HE DID--BUT HE'S GOT
   OTHER ANSWERS HE CAN GET.
    WILL HE REDEEM HIMSELF?

- EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW MUCH MILK
     WE HAVE IN OUR HOUSE.
           OBVIOUSLY,
    MY HUSBAND DOESN'T KNOW.
- EVERYBODY KNOWS HOW MANY DVDs
   WE HAVE IN THE HOUSE TOO.

         - YEAH, OKAY.
    - JAKE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - THIS IS A GIMME.

  IT'S GOTTA BE PEANUT BUTTER.
          - ALL RIGHT,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
    - I SAID PEANUT BUTTER.
        - PEANUT BUTTER.

          - YEAH, SEE?
      OKAY, NEXT QUESTION.

GENTLEMEN, WHAT IS THE ONE THING
       YOU DO CONSTANTLY
 THAT MAKES YOUR WIFE JUST LOOK
  AT YOU AND SAY, "WHATEVER"?
             KEVIN?

         - UH, GOTTA GO
   WITH I WATCH TOO MUCH TV.
    - YOU WATCH TOO MUCH TV?
   - YEAH, SHE GETS ANNOYED.
       - WHAT DO YOU SAY?

       - WAY TOO MUCH TV.
             - OH.
       - THAT'S MY GIRL.

    - BUT I BRING YOU MILK.
 - HE'S BACK ON THE PORCH NOW.
  WE'LL SEE IF HE CAN GET IN.

      - HE'S ON THE PORCH?
      - HE'S ON THE PORCH.
  - GIRL, YOU ARE A HARD ONE.
    JUST ON THE PORCH, OKAY.

        WE GOTTA GET YOU
         OFF THE PORCH.
        ALL RIGHT, JAKE,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
        - I GET NEUROTIC
ABOUT REARRANGING THE FURNITURE

         IN THE HOUSE.
           - REALLY?
       - AND I'LL, LIKE--
   I'LL START TO GET EXCITED
         ABOUT DOING IT

   AT, LIKE, 11:30 AT NIGHT,
     AND THEN I'LL BE LIKE,
   "OH, I'M GONNA, YOU KNOW,
         "WE COULD MOVE
        THE COUCH THERE,

 AND WE'LL MOVE THAT BOOKSHELF
          OVER THERE."
 AND THEN I'LL START DOING IT.
          SHE'S LIKE--
   - WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY?

    CONSTANTLY REDECORATES!
        - ALL THE TIME!
         ALL THE TIME!
        - HEY, HEY, HEY!

        - ALL THE TIME.
      WHAT DID I TELL YOU?
       - GIVE ME A KISS.
             MWAH!
       - GIVE HIM A KISS.

     ROBERT, HOW ABOUT YOU?
         - I'M OBSESSED
      WITH FANTASY SPORTS.
   LIKE, I PLAY EVERYTHING--
   BASEBALL, FOOTBALL, GOLF.

   - TIANA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     PLAYS FANTASY SPORTS.
         THERE YOU GO.
           ALL RIGHT.

   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
       COUPLE NUMBER ONE,
      YOU ARE IN THE LEAD
        WITH 40 POINTS.

       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
  SECOND PLACE WITH 25 POINTS.
      COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
 YOU'RE ALMOST OFF THAT PORCH--
           20 POINTS.

         KEEP IT HERE.
    OUR FINAL BONUS QUESTION
         IS COMING UP,
   AND IT IS WORTH 30 POINTS,

       SO ANYONE CAN WIN.
         DON'T GO AWAY.
       COUPLE NUMBER ONE,
    YOU GUYS ARE IN THE LEAD

        WITH 40 POINTS.
 COUPLE NUMBER TWO, 25 POINTS--
    YOU'RE IN SECOND PLACE.
      COUPLE NUMBER THREE,

        WE GOTTA GET YOU
        OFF THIS PORCH.
      YOU HAVE 20 POINTS.
       BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
           IT IS TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION,

         WHICH IS WORTH
        UP TO 30 POINTS.
  THIS CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,

       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
     THE MOST MODERN THING
       ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE
      IS DEFINITELY BLANK,

WHILE THE MOST TRADITIONAL THING
           IS BLANK.
             KEVIN?
     - MOST MODERN THING...

      WE GOT A NEW PLASMA.
     NEW PLASMA-SCREEN TV.
      - GOT A NEW PLASMA.

         - AND THE MOST
      TRADITIONAL THING...
             IS...
       GOTTA BE OUR LOVE.

           [laughter]
          - LET'S SEE
    WHAT YOU SAID, JENNIFER.
 - I SAID THE MOST MODERN THING
       ABOUT OUR MARRIAGE

      WAS THAT I TAKE CARE
         OF THE BILLS.
    AND THE MOST TRADITIONAL
 IS I'M YOUR TYPICAL HOUSEWIFE.
       I MAKE YOUR LUNCH,
    AND I TAKE CARE OF YOU.

        - THAT IS TRUE.
            - YEAH.
        - I'M SO SORRY.
      - THAT--THAT <i>WAS</i> TRUE.
          - I'M SORRY.

    [laughter and applause]
         - THE PLASMA?
- WE HAVE AN EXTRA COUCH AROUND
THE CORNER, KEVIN, IF YOU WANT.

           - OH, NO.
      - ALL RIGHT, ROBERT,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     - HOPEFULLY, SHE SAYS
     THE SAME THING AS HER.

         I CAN ONLY SAY
         PAY THE BILLS
          AND UH, UH,
    TAKES CARE OF THE HOUSE.
            - OKAY,
   WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, TIANA?

         PAYS THE BILL.
            I COOK.
        IT'S HALF RIGHT.
     YOU GOT IT HALF RIGHT.

             OKAY.
  SO YOU ARE TIED FOR THE LEAD
    WITH COUPLE NUMBER ONE.
        ALL RIGHT, JAKE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

            - WHEW.
           ALL RIGHT,
       MOST MODERN THING,
 UH, SHE WORKS A 9:00-TO-5:00,
          WHILE I'M--

       I'VE GOT A COUPLE
  OF VARIOUS THINGS THAT I DO.
         SO I DO A LOT
       OF THE HOUSEWORK.
        I THINK THE MOST
       TRADITIONAL THING

       HAS GOTTA BE, UH,
    THE WAY WE COMMUNICATE.
          - ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        HE'S SENSITIVE,
       AND HE SPOILS ME.

         WE HAVE A TIE
   BETWEEN COUPLE NUMBER ONE
     AND COUPLE NUMBER TWO.
    THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO GO
       TO A TIE-BREAKER.

        OH, MY GOODNESS.
    SO WE ASKED EACH COUPLE
 TO PREDICT THEIR FINAL SCORES.
  THE COUPLE WHOSE PREDICTION
          CAME CLOSEST

     TO THEIR ACTUAL SCORE
      WILL BE THE WINNER.
       COUPLE NUMBER ONE,
     WHAT DID YOU PREDICT?

           45 POINTS.
       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,
           40 POINTS!
        CONGRATULATIONS!

   Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.
       Welcome, welcome,
            welcome.

       Now take-take note
       of this trio here.
         The day before
        the 4th of July,
the Red, White and Blue,
a little craziness there.

 She's got her outfit on.
Nipsey has his little
blue and red on over there.
        Indeed, indeed.
The ladies are all in blue.

           And white.
We have red flowers
on Cindy.
What are you gonna do
on the 4th of July, Jo Anne?
               I-- We're having,
           I think-- ♪ A party

A little gathering
of the clan.
  Yes, but just before I leave
   for Pittsburgh as we said,
            to go do
     "Hello, Dolly!" there.

You just so happen
to mention that.
       Yes, and Roger doesn't do
              that show with me.
     Well, you know, we do
  a lot of-- Roger, my Roger.

    Oh, we do a lot of shows
           together,
       but he doesn't do
    with that show with me.
     So I'm off by myself.
Well, we wish you
much good luck

       in that endeavor.
        Yes. Are you going back
  to New York for the big gala?
        I will be here.
                        Uh-huh.
            Originally,
            on this day tonight,

        I was suppose to be
        at the Yankee Stadium
        but the day got changed,
      and I thought,
      "Well, I'll be in New York
           for the 4th of July,"
           didn't happen.

Cindy Crane,
what are you doing here?
                I'm here playing
                      this game.
You brought this one person
who's out there saying,

"Cindy Crane."
            Well, I don't know,
                  I thought so.
      [audience cheering]
That's your fan club.
           That's my fans. Yes.

    Uh, it says here
    you're a cheerleading coach.
                     I sure am.
That doesn't bode well.
          No, they're not here.
             They're in school.
Oh.

                           Yes.
If that's what they sound like,
you're in deep trouble.
                        I know.
      That was rather pathetic.
Good luck to you, my dear.
                     Thank you.
Nipsey, hang on
for a second,

I'll look for a word
from you in a moment.
Lyn, I hate to tell you,
this is your last day.
You've been here
for eons.

         It seems like forever.
You've won $4,450,
a trip to Hawaii,
the little video system,
   I think it was yesterday.
                        Uh-huh.

You will win today?
                     Absolutely.
                     Positively.
I will keep my fingers
crossed for you.
                     Thank you.

And on this day before
the 4th of July, Nipsey,
anything occur to you?
              Yes.
   We are a nation of lovers
   that's easily understood.

   From the little May flower
    to the number one power,
  you know we had to be good.
      [audience cheering]

     [audience applauding]
         You know what?
    You know what's so nice
        about the '80s?

                          What?
        It's nice to be
   so proud of your country.
   A few years ago, everybody's
   saying, [gibberish]
   And they were hiding
   the flag away and all.

  And it just feels so good.
                       (Nipsey)
                           Yes.
     When you look around.
                      (Jo Anne)
      It makes everybody smile.
      Yeah, enough philosophy.
      To the game!

      The Winner's Circle...
      And the things
      we have up here.
      What do they call

 A mine--
To locate mines,
you need a mine...

                        Radia--
No.
                 Geiger counter.
No, go ahead.
A mine--

What's a policeman--
A house--

       7-5 is the score.
            Cindy?
                    Be Careful.

             You are to describe
             these things
               associated
               with ice skating.
Things associated
with ice-skating.
                      Oh. Okay.

 Ready, go.
         Okay, every four years,
                  we have the...

we're trying for $10,000 now.

Your partner is hanging on
to the straps for dear life,
for fear that she'll flail
her arms around.
She's been known
to do that.

But other than that,
you're in pretty good shape.
If you can,
I know it is not easy, relax.
Get a sort
of nice calmness
to come over you

with a little edge on it,
just so that you're receiving
all of that information.
