Oh! Things that foam.

Hurry!
        [buzzer sounds]
            A fish. A raw fish.
       Things that swim!
Time ran out.

     [audience applauding]
                     Oh, well...
You want to--
You really want
to break her heart?

Let me say that--
               Break her heart.
 You got 10 more seconds.
I can't give you the money,
but just for the heck of it.

                          Okay.
Let's see.
Ready and go!
                  A caught fish.
              A found boyfriend.

                  A new husband.
See, it wouldn't have made
any difference.
                 Oh, thank God!
              Oh.

             That wouldn't help.
You know
what threw me off?
                          What?
        A caught fish.
 It's, uh...

It's things that
are hooked, by the way.
              Oh.
   When you said shaving lotion.
   Shaving cream.
                         Lotion.
                      Oh, I see.

               Oh. I was just--
Lotion just splatters on.
              Oh. That's right.
Foam.
I know you don't do this
every day.

              Well, I see Roger
                        and I--
   You see, mad dog is good.
   He foams at the mouth?
   Roger?
      [audience laughing]

 You got $750 more.
We'll add it all up
and be right back.
      [audience cheering]

      [indistinct chatter]
Cindy, you leave us
with $1,700.
                 It's been fun.
Happy 4th.
Thank you so very much.

                     Thank you.
Nipsey, enjoy the mountains
on the 4th.
        Indeed, indeed.
We'll see you again soon.
Lyn, you're the most
patriotic of all,

with the hair, red,
the blouse, white,
 then the jacket, blue.
You have $5,200,
a computer,

trip to Hawaii,
and the video system.
Thank you so much.
             Thank you so much.
            I had a great time.
                It's wonderful.
Thank you, ma'am.

Jo Anne, we'll see you
in Pittsburgh next week
with "Hello, Dolly!"
Have a great 4th of July.
         Great holiday.
 We won't be with you tomorrow.

      Special programming.
     We'll see you Monday.
    For now, I'm Dick Clark.

           Hi there!
   Thank you very, very much.
   Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.
      [audience cheering]

      Hey, I hope you had
    a great holiday weekend.
         We welcome you
    to the $25,000 Pyramid.
  Now, that you have ingested
     all of those hotdogs,

     hamburgers and relish
 and pickles and all of that--
Did you have a pleasant
holiday weekend?
         Oh, marvelous.

Sure you did.
        Just marvelous.
Ilene, this is
your first visit here.
I wanna caution you
about one thing.

Earl Holliman
is the single best player
we've ever had
in this game.
There is no one superior
to this man.

He is probably
the best Pyramid--
      [audience laughing]
No, Earl,
you and I know the truth.

No, in all seriousness,
he is very fine
  and he's a lovely gentleman.

 And he's here to help and he's
  here to beat you brains at.
         Yeah, well...
Don't let
this intimidate you.
Nothing can intimidate me.
Not much.

You will definitely
have fun.
It's a very, very big change
from "Mr. Belvedere."
We welcome you aboard.

We have a new player,
Barbara Steibel,
who is retired.
And before you retired,
Barbara, what were you up to?
      I was a medical secretary.

A medical secretary?
                   Uh-hmm. Yeah.
 We welcome you here.
Earl, tell them
how good you are.

      Listen, we practiced
    while we were together,
          so she knows
        that ain't true.
Alright.
You're a fine player.

You also have a new player,
Becky Hessemer,
who is a hotel
convention manager.
Where do you do
all that stuff?

               In Newport Beach.
We welcome you here,
good folks.
      The Winner's Circle
   is over there on a Monday.

  And I hope you get in there,
      win a ton of money.
    These are the subjects:
      We have Hanky Panky,
     Dick Clark's Favorite,
        Before The Fall,

        The Tool Chest,
        Leapin' Lizards,
         Law And Order.
    The 7-11 is in the game.

       And that's the way
        it's played out.
I'll tell you about that, Ilene,
when we get there.
 What would you like?

 Well, wouldn't you've guessed
       that we would pick
     Dick Clark's Favorite.
 Well, you probably don't know
         what this is.

      You would assume...
                      I haven't
                the faintest...
      You would assume
      this might be things to do
         with American Bandstand
         or whatever.

           No. It's things
           associated with math.
   And for your education...
                           Math?
      I don't do math very well.

I am the butt
of constant jokes here
      because I can't add
        dweebley squeet.
   And I wish you good luck.
                         Well...

         These are...
           That makes two of us.
    Things associated with math.
 Ready, go.

Uh, the directions

 to get some place.

One half is one.
                   Oh, fraction.

This is a...
                           Zero.
No.
                     Oh, circle.

Um, when you're
in the first grade,
you're in a...
             Uh, primary school.
No.

A category
of people is a...
A category of anything.
        [buzzer sounds]

A class is the thing
we're looking for, Barbara.
                             Oh.
     [audience applauding]

    Earl, you're up on deck.
Which one are you gonna
start the game with?
        Leaping Lizards.

Leaping Lizards, alright.
I would have said it was things
    to do with Orphan Annie.
 Wasn't she the one who always
    said, "Leaping Lizards?"

                   Sure she was.
       These are things
       that hop or jump.
Things that hop or jump.
             Okay.
 Ready, go.

 Uh, the Calaveras...
It's a toad.

Uh-hmm.

Uh, a lady on point
on her toes.
                 Ballet dancer.
What is she called?
                     Ballerina.
Uh-hmm. Okay.

And this animal with a pouch
in Australia.
                   Uh, kangaroo.
Uh-hmm.
Uh, and a jock is an...

                       Athlete.
And the blanks are right.
The blank is Right, the show.
                         Price.
Yeah, plural, yeah.

Um, at the end
of the torch is the...
                         Flame.
Uh-hmm.
And, uh...
        [buzzer sounds]

 Alrighty, 6-4.
     [audience applauding]
    Barbara, you're trailing
     by a couple of points.

7-11 is in there somewhere.
What would you like?
               Before The Fall.
Before The Fall.
        Oh, it's the one
        with the 7-11 .

     [audience applauding]
I'll make you a deal.
   You take that score Ilene
  up there along with Barbara

 and get it to 11 and we'll lay
    $1,100 on your partner.
         Fair enough?
                           Fine.
      11 for 11, alright?
                     We'll try.

  These are things that are part
  of the summer season.
Things that are part
of the summer season.
 Ready, go.

                           Okay.
                  Oh, it's so...
Hot.
                         Right.
          Uh, it's June, July...

August.
             And I'm gonna go...
Swimming.
                          Right.

              And I'm gonna wear
                  little shorts.
Shorts.
                 Uh-hmm. Sorry.
(Dick)
 Next.
           And I'm gonna get...

Perspiration.
               From the weather.
Humid.
                     Thank you.

Okay, that's good enough.
You didn't get the bonus but
added considerable points there.
     [audience applauding]

           It's 10-6.
We got Hanky Panky,
The Tool Chest,
 Law And Order.

Becky, which one?
         We'll take Hanky Panky.
          Hanky Panky.
            Alright.

    These are words that end
       with the letter Y.
These are words end
with the letter Y.
 Ready, go.

               Uh, this is where
 the babies are in the hospital?
Uh, maternity.
                             No.
  This is the room in your house
  where the baby is...

Oh, the nursery.
                         Uh-hmm.
     Uh, this is a type of novel
          where there's a murder
          committed, it's a...

Mystery.
                         Uh-hmm.
         Uh, this is when you're
         just tired and...
  You're very--
  You don't want to do anything.

                  You're a...
                  You're very...
Lazy.
                         Right.
          Uh, this is, oh you're
          in pain, you're in...

Agony.
               And, uh, this is,
               you take notes
  of all the stock that you have
  in your store, you take an...

Inventory.
                         Right.
                 Uh, this is...
        [buzzer sounds]
Alright, now this game
is close.

     [audience applauding]
 11-10.
Barbara, they've lost
a little of their momentum.

That works
to your advantage.
You have the choice
of the last two.
What would you prefer?

         We're gonna go
       for Law And Order.
 Okay, and who'll give?
                     I'll give.
            Ilene.

     Describe these things
   associated with a sheriff.

                           Mac.
Uh, his child was...
                       Marshall.
Yes.

Marshall it is.
     [audience applauding]
        The score stands
        6 points apart.

  Last subject is Tool Chest.
Earl and Becky,
who will give and receive?
       I'll give, Dick.
Earl you need
them all to win.

   If you get stuck you might
 want to go for a tie breaker.
   These are things you need
     to help build a house.
 Things you help need--

You need to help
build a house.
I beg your pardon.
You need 18 points.

Let's go to the Winners Circle
and try for $10,000.
      [audience cheering]

There you go.
            Thanks.
Just slip in there.
     [audience applauding]

Alrighty.
Becky, Earl, we've talked
a lot about winning the money.
We're gonna go for $10,000
right now in just about, hmm,

20 seconds or so.
I have to remind Earl, he has
a short retention span here.
How many times
have you played this game?

         Uh, I'm not sure, Dick.
     Not long ago, it seems like
       I was a virgin on this...
               I mean a newcomer
         to this show, you know?

                       So, uh...
      [audience laughing]
Easy, easy big fellow.
Choose your words
carefully here.

The fact of the matter is,
we can repeat the rules.
There are people who come
aboard that have seen the show.
That's the reason
you have arm straps,

you can't use your hands.
We ask you to please
give us just the list.
Use very few adjectives

because if you say certain
things, you'll get in trouble.
The more you talk the more
trouble you're in,
and I'm in trouble
for talking so much.

I'm going out of here.
For 10,000,
here is your first subject.
Go.

         Uh, cigarettes, cigars.
Things you smoke.
                           Yes.
      [audience cheering]

     Uh, well, I live in the sea
          and I have eight arms.

           Uh, hurting your foot
        or smashing your finger.

Things you stub.

                 Uh, sad movies.
Things that make you cry.
                           Yes.
      [audience cheering]

Things that are flaky.

 Um, deep sea fish.
Sludge, oil sludge.

      Things that are...
Shells.
       Things on a beach.
 Um...the first rung.

Rung, the first rung.
       Things you climb.
The ladder's first rung.
       The ladder's first rung.
       Things you step.

Where is the first rung?
     Things on the bottom.
                           Yes.
Yeah.
                 Very good clue.
     [audience applauding]

     That's a dandy score.
You can't hardly
beat $750,
except to maybe move to the top
and lose one in the meantime.

So that's gonna
hold you pretty good.
We'll be back to play
the second round in a moment.
 Don't go away.

     [audience applauding]
          On a Monday
    with the $25,000 Pyramid
    rolls into Part Number 2
      with Becky Hessimer

 having picked up $750.
You're partnered with
Ilene Graff who play--
Is it Marsha Owens?
                     That's it.

      On "Mr. Belvedere."
                         Uh-hmm.
                Where do we see
                "Mr. Belvedere?"
    On ABC on Friday nights
            at 8:30.

That's all
the information we need.
And you are invited to join in.
    That's "Mr. Belvedere."
        Welcome ladies.

     Earl, you and Barbara
     are partnered up here
   and these are the subjects
         we'll ask you
        to pick one from
          in a moment:

    We have What's His Name,
       Don't Fence Me In,
       The Lion's Denim,
      The Top Of The Heap,
   Look For The Onion Label,
        and Numero Uno.

       None of those make
     any sense whatsoever.
      There's a Mystery 7
           in there.
        And you're gonna
       want to get that.

   If you can get 7 out of 7,
   you'll win a trip for two
         to Australia.
                             Oh.
Nice thought.

Where...where
do we go, Earl?

The second time into

 you try for $25,000.

And, Ilene,
I should caution you
not to use your hands
since this is your first trip
in that chair.

As opposed to the other game
where you can say and do
and gesticulate
to your heart's content.
You're a little
confined here.

So try to keep
a tidy list going, alright?
            Uh-hmm.
Concentrate.
If she's on the right track,
give her a head nod.

That's good or a no-no
or one of those.
But if she's in the area,
give her a little encouragement,
then she can shoot
for words, okay?
                           Okay.

      Here we go for $25,000,
