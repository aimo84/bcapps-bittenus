              Hey!
   Thank you very, very much.
           That's it.

           Thank you.
        Johnny Gilbert,
     you're in good voice,
   and I hope you stay there
    for the next half hour.

         We welcome you
    to The $25,000 Pyramid.
Audrey Landers,
as Johnny mentioned,
is from ""Chorus Line,"

but that's not
the current activity.
That's old news.
        That's old news.
     How long ago
     did you shoot that picture?

      Well, I'll tell you,
  it took 7 months to film it
       and it took about
     another almost a year
    before they release it.

Wow, so that was
a long time ago for you.
             Yeah.
 Now, she's off on another
 project about which we'll talk.
             Anna Heltman
             is your partner.

And, Anna,
what is it you do?
                 Uh, two things,
        I work at the Mercantile
             Exchange in Chicago

         and you're on the phone
             and you're flashing
                 buy-sell orders
                with your hands.
I know that stuff.
                          Yeah.

         That's crazy.
          It's extremely crazy.
Is that the two things,
both at the--
      Well, you buy and you face
       towards you and you sell,

       and then you flash prices
            and bids and offers.
How do you learn
this stuff?
                     Like that.
   You don't have time to learn,
   you just set--

Just do it.
                  Got to do it.
   This is sort of like that.
      You don't have time
   to think here, just do it,

   as any one of these people
         will tell you.
 Brian, did you learn this game
 or did it just happen to you?
      Uh, you just do it.

         You just do it
       and you learn it.
And whether
you're right or wrong.
      You'll never know.
                  That's right.

   This man has right more times
   than wrong.
               Margaret Smith
               is with us today.
We have two new players

because one of our players
left us yesterday
after five games.
And, Margaret,
what's your regular job?

     for a psychiatric hospital.
We're happy
to have you here.

     I'd like Cash Only, please.
      Cash Only is the one
         with the 7-11.

             Yeah!
           [audience applauding]
            It's a double reason
            to get 7 out of 7.

             If you get to 14,
             you'll win $1,100.

Audrey and Anna
in the Winner's Circle.
The rules of the game,
as you come in to the Circle

for the first time,
you try for $10,000,
and that's where you are.
Uh, can you relax
or is that impossible?

      Totally impossible,
     but I'll give it a go.
Alright, we'll do
the rub down here.
           Thank you.
That will get you here,
nice and slow, alright.

The main thing,
though, is not to get
your excitement level
so high
that you get too panicky
and blow it, alright?
             Okay.

 There we go.
Uh, sir, can we, uh,
do that one more time, please?
Thank you very much.
Here we go.

There's a monitor over there.
It need to be covered.
 Are you ready?
 For $10,000,

here is your first subject.
Go!
                Okay, the beach.

                   An hourglass.
Things that tell time.

                 Okay, Sukiyaki.

Things that are--
        [buzzer sounds]
                             Oh.

A motorless airplane.
           A motorless airplane.
          A motorless?
            Things--

What does
a motorless airplane do?
         A motorless--
           A glider.
Other than crash. Yes.

                       A glider!
                      It glides.
It glides.
          Is that it?
Yeah.

                           Yes.
You were so close.
I don't know.
When you started,
maybe it was 25 seconds.
            I know.
That's a tough break.

        That's alright.
          That's okay.
What else glides?
Birds, I guess, glide.
                         Glide.
Soaring birds.

Alright, that's $750.
     Thank you. Thank you.

 We'll be back to play
 the second round of the Pyramid
right after this.
              We were so close,
I didn't know what was thinking.
           A motorless airplane.

               I was afraid that
                I would describe
             a glider, you know?
It's fair enough to say that
a motorless airplane glides.

              Yes.
That word
would have been glider.
Then you could have said
motorless airplane.
             Okay.

        You know, Anna,
        you've won $750.
     You and Brian will be
    partnered in this round.
  They're already checking out
     the board over there.

 If you would add up the money
         at the moment,
         Anna has $750
    and Margaret has $1,100.
   You'd think Ann was ahead.

    Well, in a way, you are.
      You got more money,
   but you don't have score.
      So you've got to win
   this round to get up there
         on the board.

          When you get
    to the Winner's Circle,
   you'll want to match $750
          or beat it.
            Ladies,

have in common after you play.

           And Zurich came late.
   That's not a good sign, Anna.
  The only thing you can hang on
  to is that $750 you won

        because it would appear,
          unless Margaret runs
          into awful difficulty.
    She's gonna head over there
    and beat, uh, beat you here,

            but she got to do it
            over there, too.
Who will give?

That's alright,

              Oh.
Oh.

  I thought I was gonna knock
         the chair off.
Right before
this game started,
Margaret was over here
talking to herself.

We have discussed
if you win it.
You were giving yourself
a lecture.
           Pep talk.
What were you saying?
         I was saying
   I'm an intelligent woman,

       and I can do this
  and it's not that difficult.
You're right.
       And Aubrey gives
          good clues.
          And not to psych
          yourself out.

 It was terrific.
Because you said, your pants,
your husband's pants,
you got it.
                         Right.

  The male, female, where would
  that be logical, and so forth.
It was good clue giving,
good receiving.
        Wonderful clues.
                            Yay!

You have won $10,000.
That's not the end of it.
You can come back tomorrow
and win some more.
You can go well over $50,000.

        But I'm looking
     for a trip to Tahiti.
Why not?
Maybe tomorrow.
We'll talk about it in a second
right after this.

      Thank you very much.
              You were terrific.
                 You didn't miss
             anything, you know?

Thank you, ma'am.

Brian, we'll see you tomorrow
on the Pyramid.
Margaret, you're up
