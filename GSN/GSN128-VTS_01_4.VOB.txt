We're gonna have some fun,
that's for sure.

Mary, how are you?
          I'm great.
 What is the outfit called?
             Red.
      [audience laughing]

Stand up,
let's take a look at it.
Oh, yes, yes.
      [audience cheering]

We have a matching set
of celebrities today.
     I know we planned it.
      We called each other
           last night

      and said Wednesday
       will be red day.
Danny, you get equal time now.
Let's see what you--
Let's see.
Is that a vision
of loveliness or not?

      [audience cheering]
Danny, sit down will you?
     Robyn Jones, it isn't
     always this mad here.

How are you?
               Fine, thank you.
You are the mother
of a child.
A boy or a girl?
                         A boy.

How old is he?
                 One and a half.
And his name?
                           Kyle.
   Nice to have you aboard.
   Things are gonna simmer down.

   We're gonna drive through
         to this game.
     Danny, uh, let's see,
Danny Weaver has won
a trip to Australia,
is all I can remember.

Did you win some money, too?
               Uh, yes, $1,600.
 Yeah, not a bad start.
Uh, you are
in the animation business

     is that fair to say?
                         Right.
                  That's right.
       I think you'll be
      reasonably animated
    when you get over there
       and win the money.

      You try for $10,000
          or $25,000.
   And these are the subjects
     at hand, good people.
       We've got Mr "T",
      A Place Of Worship,

           Mug Shots,
        Thin And Dandy,
        It's Your Move,

Not Greek but...
                       Italian.
No the other one.
The formal.
                         Latin.
Right.

And a priest says
a high...
                           Mass.
And, um, Romeo-

Uh, Juliet spoke to Romeo
from the...
                 Uh, a balcony.

                  We're gonna go
                   with Mr. "T".
Mr. "T".
Alright.

                          Sleep.
                           Rest.
 Smelling salts when you...
                         Relax.

        [buzzer sounds]
        Holly molly.
        Isn't that...

     [audience applauding]
      That's not a first.
But I can count on the fingers
on one hand how many times

        it has happened
         in 14 years.
                 Yeah, it hurts.
   That really smarts, Danny.
Uh, I know
you're better than that.

And, David, you had
an extraordinary record here.
The first one was a rabbit.
       The smelling salts
        when you faint.

Faint.
        I was about to.
And, uh...
      [audience laughing]
      What's the other one?
      Oh, experiment.

      Experiment.
      I'll tell you what,
      clear it from your mind.
      It ain't gonna help,
      you're gonna lose.

There's no way to pull out
of this mess
unless these ladies
go home.
Uh, the thing to do though
I think is really...

    You obviously were both
       off kilter there.
       Get back in form.
   Try to get your spirits up

      and then pick it up
       in the next round.

No, both of you.
Oh, a lot of people have been
trying to figure that out.
No, you're just--
You're just--

The two of you aren't connecting

It's just-- It's just
not working for you.
These ladies are indeed
going to win.

 They need only one answer.
But in the next round,

if you win twice,
you go to 25,000.
We'll keep

As long as you get the answer.
                   I don't care.

             Yes, if it'll work,

        Oh, I'm sorry.
                See, obviously,
               I don't do that.
You don't clip your coupons,
you just live on your interest
and all those other things.

Oh, coupons, they get
the soap at reduced prices.
                           Yeah.
           Perfect.
         In the old days,
         in the financial world,

  people use to clip the coupons
  off of their bonds.
  And they would send them
  and then they get their money.
         I don't do that either.
I don't know if they still
do that or not.

                  Paper clips...
  Important documents, coupons,
    that's the definitive clue.
    Oh, clip, yeah, right.
        Those are good.
Alright, my dear,
you got $750.

It will be
a tough score to beat.
And we'll be back

Obviously, its...
             I thought I try to
             sneak it in there.

Yeah, instruction
and direction would not...
        [buzzer sounds]
         Oh, come on.
Would not be acceptable,
they're synonymous.
But you could say
an operating manual,

that wouldn't have
the problem.
