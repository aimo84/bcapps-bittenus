EN I'M NOT SURE
       IF IT'S HURON THAT'S NEXT

                OR IF IT'S --
             WELL, I KNOW
      THAT SUPERIOR IS NOT THERE
      AND MICHIGAN IS NOT THERE,

    SO THAT LEAVES ME WITH HURON
          AND A FIFTH LAKE
    WHOSE NAME I CAN'T REMEMBER.
          UM, BUT I'VE RULED OUT
              THREE OF THEM,

       SO I THINK I WANT TO PEEK
            AT KYLE'S PAPER.
        OKAY.
                  AND THAT'S
              WHAT I'M GONNA DO.

         YOU ARE BURNING
       THROUGH THESE CHEATS
      QUICKER THAN A ROCKET
  IN ITS FIRST 30 SECONDS HERE.
           [ LAUGHTER ]

        YOU WANT TO PEEK.
         THE QUESTION IS,
    "THE U.S. STATE OF INDIANA
    BORDERS WHICH GREAT LAKE?"

   YOUR CLASSMATE KYLE SAID...
                  LAKE ERIE.
            LAKE ERIE.

        I THINK I MISSPELLED IT.
     AT LEAST IT'S NOT SPELLING.
          YEAH, IT'S NOT
       A SPELLING QUESTION.

                    YEAH.
      WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?
WELL, I'VE GOT A MENTAL IMAGE
OF THAT CORNER OF THE WORLD.

I KNOW THAT LAKE ERIE
IS WHERE NEW YORK HAS A VERY
SMALL PART THAT TOUCHES IT.
THERE'S A MUCH BIGGER PART
NEXT TO NEW YORK THAT TOUCHES.

AND I THINK THAT'S INDIANA.
OH, BOY, THIS IS TOUGH.
KYLE DIDN'T LET ME DOWN
   THE FIRST TIME,

SO I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
WITH KYLE'S ANSWER AGAIN.
 AND SO I'M GONNA SAY
     "LAKE ERIE."
           "LAKE ERIE"?

  BEFORE I SHOW YOU THE ANSWER,
  I HAVE A LITTLE PIECE OF VIDEO
        I WANT YOU TO SEE.

     TO USE THEIR ANSWER OR NOT.
  COPY MEANS YOU HAVE TO TAKE
THE ANSWER THEY'VE WRITTEN DOWN.

        YEAH!
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

            HI, BOYS.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

     NOW, MOM, HAVE YOU EVER HAD
     TROUBLE TELLING THEM APART?
               NO.
WHEN WE WERE BABIES, NOBODY
COULD TELL THE DIFFERENCE.

                         REALLY?
              YEAH.
    THEY WERE REAL IDENTICAL.
         I THINK WE HAVE A PHO--
            OH, LOOK AT THAT.

         AWW.
               WHICH IS WHICH?
  FLIP A COIN, JEFF.
 I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

                   REALLY?
               MOM, DO YOU KNOW
              WHICH ONE'S WHICH?
 CORY'S ON THE LEFT IN THE BLUE,
    AND CHAD'S IN THE YELLOW.

              THAT'S AS CLOSE
            TO LOOKING IDENTICAL
   AS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.
         MY SISTER AND I --
    THEY COULDN'T TELL US APART,

             BUT MY MUSTACHE
          GOT THICKER THAN HERS.
           [ LAUGHTER ]
               THAT IS SO COOL.

      ALL RIGHT. WE'RE DOWN
 TO SEVEN SUBJECTS ON THE BOARD.
              PICK ONE OF THEM.
LET'S GO 2nd GRADE ANIMAL
SCIENCE AND WORK OUR WAY UP.

         ANIMAL SCIENCE?
       WE'LL TAKE 2nd GRADE
         ANIMAL SCIENCE.
       2nd GRADE ANIMAL SCIENCE.

         LET'S PLAY FOR $10,000.
           HERE IS THE QUESTION.
 "COWS EXIST IN HERDS WHILE ANTS
   LIVE IN GROUPS CALLED WHAT?

          COLONIES, COMMUNITIES,
              OR CLUSTERS."
            ALANA HAS LOCKED IN.
      I'M THINKING COLONIES.

YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M AGREEING
WITH YOU FOR THE FIRST TIME.
         SO, YOU KNOW --
Foxworthy: NOW, YOU HAVE
BOTH YOUR CHEATS LEFT.

         WE DON'T AGREE OFTEN,
        SO WE GOT TO GO WITH IT.
     I'M GONNA GO WITH COLONIES.
         WOW.

YOU GUYS AGREED ON THIS
    VERY QUICKLY.
YOU'RE HUGGING EACH OTHER
       TIGHTLY.
YOU FEELING CONFIDENT?
 NO, YOU'RE NERVOUS?

      I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.
                         REALLY?
           WELL, GOT TO BE SMART
           AS A 5th GRADER HERE.
          GUESS WHAT -- YOU ARE.

              YOU HAVE $10,000.
       ANTS DO LIVE IN COLONIES.
                   GUYS --

       OH, MAN!
              THIS NEXT QUESTION
                IS A BIG ONE.
        YEAH.

     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
  BECAUSE IF YOU HAD FLUNKED OUT
  OF SCHOOL UP UNTIL THIS POINT,
          YOU WOULD HAVE LEFT US
              WITH NOTHING.

    YOU GET THIS QUESTION RIGHT,
              THE WORST THING
           THAT CAN HAPPEN TODAY
         IS THE TWO OF YOU WALK
       OUT OF HERE WITH $25,000.

I'M OKAY WITH THAT, JEFF.
WE'RE ALL RIGHT WITH THAT.
     ALL RIGHT, ALANA HAS GOT TO
       RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM.
  THANK YOU, ALANA.

                 TIME TO PICK
              ANOTHER CLASSMATE.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
    I SAY SPENCE.

       WE'LL TAKE SPENCER.

     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

   COME ON, SPENCE.

          COME ON, BOYS.

       TWIN UP.
               PICK A SUBJECT.
              LET'S WIN $25,000.
  3rd GRADE MATH...
  OR LIFE SCIENCE.

         3rd GRADE MATH?
  WE'LL GO WITH 3rd GRADE MATH.
               3rd GRADE MATH.
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

      THE $25,000 QUESTION IS...
        "AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE
      HAS HOW MANY EQUAL SIDES?"
      SPENCER LOCKED IN BEFORE
    I COULD REPEAT THE QUESTION.

 YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.
           YEAH, 'CAUSE
      I'M A LITTLE CLUELESS.
  I AM, TOO, BUDDY.

            NOW, DO YOU REMEMBER
                 TRIANGLES?
      OH, I DO.
    I WANT TO SAY
IT'S THREE EQUAL SIDES, BUT --

          I WOULD THINK
         TWO EQUAL SIDES.
YOU WANT TO DO A CHEAT?
YOU WANT TO DO A PEEK?
   OR DO YOU KNOW?

        YEAH. YEAH, I DO.
              YOU GOT THE CHEATS
                FOR A REASON.
     I MEAN, IF IT CAN HELP YOU,
         WE WANT TO HELP YOU.

        "AN ISOSCELES TRIANGLE
      HAS HOW MANY EQUAL SIDES?"
     WHAT DO YOU THINK, CHAD?
     I'D SAY TWO.

           YOU SAY TWO?
      BUT YOU GUYS CAN WALK AWAY
       RIGHT NOW WITH $10,000.
  NO. WE NEED TO GET
TO THAT 25 GRAND MARK.

                    WELL,
             BUT IF YOU MISS IT,
    YOU'RE LEAVING WITH NOTHING,
               OKAY?
  GO AHEAD AND PEEK.

     WANT TO GO FOR A PEEK?
 YEP.
 YOU'RE LOCKED IN
 ONCE WE GET THIS RIGHT.
 WE'RE AT 25 GRAND. THAT'S
 THE MINIMUM WE LEAVE WITH.

     SO WE'LL TAKE OUR PEEK.
     YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR PEEK?
     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]

                 LET'S RECAP.
                YOU SAID TWO.
               CHAD SAID THREE.
                  LET'S SEE
              WHAT SPENCER SAID.

               SPENCER SAID...
                     ONE.
               SO, HE SAYS ONE,
                 YOU SAY TWO,

                YOU SAY THREE.
        YEAH.
        WHAT DO YOU THINK?

          WELL, IT SAYS HOW MANY
           EQUAL SIDES, AND...
 THAT'S PLURAL, SO I WOULD THINK
         IT WOULD BE TWO,
                AND YOU THINK
              IT'S THREE, SO...

                    GOSH.
      Foxworthy:
NOW, HERE'S ANOTHER OPTION.
    YOU COULD PICK
 ONE OF YOUR ANSWERS

             THAT YOU'RE
      THE MOST COMFORTABLE WITH,
   AND IF YOU'RE WRONG AND HE'S
 RIGHT, HE COULD STILL SAVE YOU.
     I STILL THINK IT'S TWO.

       DO YOU?
I'LL TRUST YOU, BUDDY.
I MEAN, IF HE DID GET IT RIGHT
 WITH ONE, WE'RE IN,

BUT IF NOT, WE'RE TAKING
  A LONG WALK HOME.
          YEAH, WE ARE.
      I SAY WE GO WITH TWO.
        WHAT DO YOU THINK?

I TRUST YOU.
          YOU TRUST ME?
  YEAH, I TRUST YOU.
       OH, THAT'S TROUBLE.

       I'M GONNA GO WITH --
      <i>WE</i> ARE GONNA GO WITH TWO.

    I'M FEELING GOOD ABOUT THAT.
             THERE'S TWO OF YOU.
              AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

 I GOT TO TELL YOU, IT'S AMAZING
  THAT YOU TRUST HIM THAT MUCH.
               YOU WENT AGAINST
              YOUR OWN INSTINCT.
  YOU WENT AGAINST WHAT THIS KID
    IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SAID

          BECAUSE YOU TRUST HIM.
         I WILL TELL YOU THIS --
               SPENCER'S WRONG.

        [ AUDIENCE OOHs ]
     THE REST OF THEM ARE RIGHT.
          DO YOU WANT TO SEE
     WHAT THEY SAID FOR $25,000?

     YEAH, WE DO.
                 THEY SAID...
                     TWO!

     [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
        YEAH!
             COME ON!

            HIGH FIVE!

    HAS EXACTLY TWO EQUAL SIDES.

            Announcer:
      FIND OUT HOW FAR THEIR
  TWIN-TUITION TAKES THEM NEXT.

      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,
  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.

 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,

BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)

    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,
      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.

 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.
   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING

AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK

     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,
    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,

OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.
    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,

     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,
    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.

  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.
  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.

HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.
 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.

THERE'S 352 FEET IN A YARD!
           [ LAUGHTER ]

     SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
UM...
YOU COULD GO
WITH MARKI'S ANSWER.
YOU CAN GO WITH YOUR ANSWER.

HOW MANY FEET IS THAT?

         IS HOW MANY FEET
       ARE IN 2 1/2 YARDS?

       ANY KIND OF A BELL?

        YEAH.
        350 --
   YOU HAD 352, WHICH IS CLOSE
      TO THE DAYS IN A YEAR.

           [ LAUGHTER ]
         AND YOU HAD 52,
   WHICH WERE WEEKS IN A YEAR.
            AND I KNOW
    IT'S A CHEMISTRY PROBLEM.

           [ LAUGHTER ]
           2 1/2 YARDS.
   IF THERE'S 3 FEET IN A YARD,

        2 YARDS IS 6 FEET,
    HALF A YARD IS 1 1/2 FEET,
     WHICH MAKES 7 1/2 FEET.
      I AM SORRY, JENNIFER.

   7 1/2 IS THE CORRECT ANSWER.

         TO GO HOME YET.
   I DON'T, EITHER.

           FOR $25,000,
        DID SHE SAY TRUE?
         YES!
    YOU SAVED ME.
      [ LAUGHS ]

                    WHOO!
     OH, HO, HO.
         AAH!

              WHOO!
         WOW.
                     YES!

          "ACCORDING TO
   THE ANCIENT ROMAN CALENDAR,
     THE IDES OF MARCH FALLS
     ON WHICH DAY IN MARCH?"
       ALANA HAS LOCKED IN
           HER ANSWER.

     I, FOR ONE, AM VERY GLAD
    THEY GIVE ME THE ANSWERS.
           [ LAUGHTER ]
         I HAVE NO IDEA.

YOU STILL HAVE YOUR COPY
    AND YOUR PEEK.
     SO, LOOKING AT HER PAPER
   IS NOT GONNA HELP ME AT ALL.
       I WOULD JUST HAVE TO
             COPY IT.

          YOU KNOW WHAT?
        SHE SAVED ME ONCE.
        I'M GONNA GO AHEAD
       AND COPY HER PAPER,

      LET HER SAVE ME AGAIN.
