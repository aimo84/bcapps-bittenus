   - HI, I'M SHERRI SHEPHERD.
    NOW YOU KNOW IN SOMALIA
     A GIRL CAN BE ENGAGED

    EVEN BEFORE SHE'S BORN.
    THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE
          FOR A BABY.
YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO LOOK
  CUTE IN A SONOGRAM PICTURE?

           [laughter]
- HERE ARE TONIGHT'S NEWLYWEDS.
   HE HAD A HUGE CRUSH ON HER
        IN HIGH SCHOOL,
BUT SHE ALWAYS HAD A BOYFRIEND.

        14 YEARS LATER,
     IT'S FINALLY HIS TURN.
     PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE.

SHE'S A TOUGH ROLLER DERBY GIRL

            - HELLO.

      - HELLO AND WELCOME
     TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
WE HAVE SENT THE WIVES BACKSTAGE
       SO WE CAN ASK YOU,
 THE HUSBANDS, SOME QUESTIONS.

          HERE WE GO.
    WHEN YOUR WIFE'S DEFENSE
   STOPS YOUR SEXUAL OFFENSE,

     DO YOU TEND TO GIVE UP
           AND PUNT,
 CALL A NEW PLAY AND PRESS ON,
 OR JUST SCORE ONE ON YOUR OWN?

           [laughter]
           - KI-KIEA?
    - I HAVE TO SAY I'D CALL
    A NEW PLAY AND PRESS ON.

   I DON'T GIVE UP THAT EASY.
         - OH, REALLY?
           - I CAN'T.
           - [laughs]
  OKAY. WHAT ABOUT YOU, PAUL?

    - I'M ALSO GONNA GO WITH
 CALL A NEW PLAY AND PRESS ON.
     I DON'T--I'M NOT GOOD
    WITH FOOTBALL ANALOGIES,
      BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW
   ANYTHING ABOUT FOOTBALL...

           - [laughs]
   - BUT I'M GONNA SAY THAT,
 IF I HAVE MY EYES ON AN GOAL,
  I'M GONNA GO FOR THAT GOAL,
      AND I'M GONNA GET IT
  NO MATTER WHAT'S IN MY WAY.

      - OKAY. NO OBSTACLE
   CAN BE IN YOUR WAY. PHIL?
    - WELL, I'D HAVE TO SAY
           I'D PUNT.
   I'M NOT TOO PROUD TO ADMIT

    THAT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
    TO PICK YOUR BATTLES...
             - YES.
  - SO I'LL PUNT AND HOPE SHE
  FUMBLES IT AT THE GOAL LINE.

     - [laughs] ALL RIGHT,
  NEXT A QUESTION, HUSBANDS--
   IF YOUR WIFE HAD THE TIME
         AND THE MONEY
    TO TAKE PRIVATE LESSONS
        WITH AN EXPERT,

 WHAT NEW SKILL WOULD YOU HOPE
         SHE DEVELOPS?
             PAUL?
    - WELL, I HAVE A SAYING
     WITH MY WIFE, UM, THAT

 WHEN IT COMES TO HER COOKING,
 SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO COOK.
  SHE KNOWS HOW TO BOIL THINGS
        AND POUR CHEESE
    ON THE STUFF SHE BOILED.

          - WHOA. OH.
    - AND SHE'S BEEN TRYING.
       SHE'S BEEN TRYING.
      - SHE'S BEEN TRYING.
  - SO I'M GONNA SAY COOKING.

       I'M GONNA SAY THAT
 SHE WOULD BETTER HER COOKING.
            - PHIL?
      - I ALSO AM GONNA GO
         WITH COOKING.

           - KI-KIEA?
 - COOKING, BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T
     COOK AS GOOD AS I DO.
- OH. WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE THING
            TO COOK?

   - UM, LET'S SEE, WE CAN GO
OXTAILS AND SOME RICE AND GRAVY
         AND SOME--SOME
       KIND OF VEGETABLE.
  - OOH, THAT SOUNDS SO GOOD.

       GENTLEMEN, THIS IS
      THE FINAL QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
       TORTURE IS ILLEGAL
        IN THIS COUNTRY,

    AND YET THE AUTHORITIES
           DO NOTHING
WHEN MY WIFE FORCES ME TO SPEND
  TIME WITH HER FRIEND BLANK.
           [laughter]
            - PHIL?

   SHE'S--SHE'S A NICE GIRL.
      SHE'S A GREAT GIRL.
BUT SHE'S JUST GOT WAY TOO MUCH
 ENERGY AND WAY TOO MANY IDEAS.
           [laughter]

      - WHAT KIND OF IDEAS
         DOES SHE HAVE?
        - I DON'T KNOW,
     BUT THEY USUALLY START
  WITH ALCOHOL AND END BADLY.

         - OH. SO A LOT
  OF ENERGY AND ALCOHOL. HMM.
         - PRETTY MUCH.
- OKAY. KI-KIEA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - IF I WOULD HAVE
       TO PICK SOMEBODY,

  IT WOULD HAVE TO BE KARINE.
           - KARINE?
     - UM, SHE'S GOT THREE
  OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL KIDS,
    BUT THEY DRIVE ME CRAZY.

     - [laughs] OKAY. PAUL?
    - KRISTEN HAS ONE FRIEND
   THAT IS UNABLE TO HAVE FUN
  WHO IS JUST WAY TOO SERIOUS
         ALL THE TIME,

AND SHE IS CONSTANTLY FORCING ME
TO SPEND TIME WITH THIS PERSON,
    AND HER NAME IS OLIVIA,
  SO I'M GONNA GO WITH OLIVIA.
       - OLIVIA WHO IS--
      HOW ARE YOU UNABLE--

        - I'M NOT SORRY.
      - YOU'RE NOT SORRY?
           [laughter]
 - HE IS NOT SORRY. I LOVE IT.
       NICE JOB, FELLAS.

       I HOPE YOUR WIVES
     CAN MATCH YOUR ANSWERS
BECAUSE THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST
 POINTS AT THE END OF THE GAME
  WILL WIN A FANTASTIC SECOND
    HONEYMOON TO COSTA RICA.

         CHECK IT OUT.

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES.
 YOU'RE BACK. WOW, WE LOVE IT.

NOW WHILE YOU WERE GONE I ASKED
 YOUR HUSBANDS THREE QUESTIONS,
  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
       IS WORTH 5 POINTS.

     SO HERE WE GO, LADIES.
    WHEN YOUR DEFENSE STOPS
 YOUR HUSBAND'S SEXUAL OFFENSE,
    DOES HE TEND TO GIVE UP
           AND PUNT,

 CALL A NEW PLAY AND PRESS ON,
 OR JUST SCORE ONE OF HIS OWN?
            NICOLE?

        - MY, GOD. UM...
    I'M GONNA SAY HE SCORES
        ONE OF HIS OWN.
I THINK WHEN I LEAVE THE HOUSE,
   THAT'S WHEN HE'S SCORING,

    SO I-I--SO I'M GONNA SAY
   HE SCORES ONE OF HIS OWN.
- WHEN YOU LEAVE THE HOUSE, HE'S
 LIKE, "OH, SHE'S GONE!" OKAY.
      - YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
         I'M GONNA SAY.

- AND WHAT DID YOU SAY, KI-KIEA?
    YOU SAID CALL A NEW PLAY
         AND PRESS ON.
     - WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
 - HOW OFTEN DO I JUST GIVE UP?

    - YEAH, BUT WHAT--CALL--
      THAT MAKES ME THINK
YOU'RE CALLING SOME OTHER WOMAN
        OR SOMETHING...
         I MEAN, WHAT--
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT--OKAY.

   - KRISTEN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
      - I'M GONNA GO WITH

     JUST 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
     HE'LL KIND OF BE LIKE,

"OKAY, YOU KNOW," AND THEN MAYBE
  GO DOWNSTAIRS, GET A DRINK,
     COME BACK, AND, LIKE,
     START AGAIN, YOU KNOW.
       - ALL RIGHT, PAUL?

 CALL A NEW PLAY AND PRESS ON.
- CALL A NEW PLAY AND PRESS ON.
             - YES!
   - BECAUSE I AM RELENTLESS
        IN MY ENDEAVORS.

          - THANK YOU.
      - SO, KRISTEN, NOW--
       SO THIS IS GREAT.
        YOU ARE--YOU ARE
      A ROLLER DERBY GIRL.

             - YES.
       - YOU ARE SKATING
      IN THE ROLLER DERBY?
   - YEAH, I'M GINGER VITIS.

        - GINGER VITIS.
       THAT'S YOUR NAME?
  OKAY. AND, JENN, WE'LL GO...
- I THINK HE DOES THE FIRST ONE.

    - HE DOES THE FIRST ONE.
     HE GIVES UP AND PUNTS.
  - I THINK SO, YES. HE DOES.
    - OKAY. WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      GIVES UP AND PUNTS.
            - YEAH.

          - ALL RIGHT.
   WIVES, OUR NEXT QUESTION.
 IF YOU HAD THE TIME AND MONEY

    TO TAKE PRIVATE LESSONS
        WITH AN EXPERT,
WHAT NEW SKILL DID YOUR HUSBAND
      HOPE YOU'D DEVELOP?
            KRISTEN?
           - COOKING?

    - YEAH, YOU DON'T COOK?
        - HE ALWAYS SAYS
    THAT I ONLY MAKE THINGS
 THAT YOU CAN POUR CHEESE OVER,
         WHICH IS TRUE.

    SO I WOULD SAY COOKING.
       - ALL RIGHT, PAUL,
    WHAT'D YOU SAY? COOKING.
       - I SAID COOKING.
         - YES! REALLY?

   - YEAH. I TOLD THAT STORY.
     - YOU TOLD THE STORY?
   - I SAID THE THING, YEAH.
    - JENN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
        COOKING AS WELL.

      I-I ATTEMPT TO COOK,
    BUT I DON'T DO IT OFTEN,
  BUT I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO,
   SO I'M GONNA SAY COOKING.
- PHIL, WHAT'D YOU SAY? COOKING.
            - YEAH!

     [cheers and applause]
           - NICOLE?
         - A STRIPPER,
   I'M GONNA SAY A STRIPPER.

           [laughter]
         - OKAY. WELL.
    KI-KIEA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
           - WELL...
           - COOKING.

         - OH, MY GOD.
      I KNOW HOW TO COOK.
 - BUT, KI-KIEA, ARE YOU SAYING
         YOU'D LIKE HER
    TO COOK BETTER THAN YOU,

  OR YOU'D LIKE HER TO GO GET
EXPERT LESSONS FROM A STRIPPER?
     - WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT,
NOW THAT SHE PUT THAT OUT THERE,
SHE CAN GO DO THE STRIPPER ONE.
           - [laughs]

    - THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
 - I GOT NO PROBLEM WITH THAT.
     I'LL CONTINUE COOKING
 IF SHE'D DO THAT, NO PROBLEM.
        - OKAY, GOT IT.

        LADIES, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       TORTURE IS ILLEGAL
        IN THIS COUNTRY,

    AND YET THE AUTHORITIES
           DO NOTHING
WHEN MY WIFE FORCES ME TO SPEND
  TIME WITH HER FRIEND BLANK.
             JENN?
      - MY FRIEND BRITNEY?

     - YOUR FRIEND BRITNEY.
 WHO'S--TELL ME ABOUT BRITNEY?
  - SHE'S GONNA GET MAD AT ME
         FOR SAYING IT.
   SHE'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT.
  SHE LIKES TO HAVE SOME FUN.

    - PHIL, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
       - BRIT, ALL RIGHT.
        - OKAY. NICOLE?
           - KARINE?
           - KARINE.
   NOW TELL ME ABOUT KARINE.

       - SHE TALKS A LOT,
    AND HE CAN'T STAND THAT.
 SHE'S TALK, TALK, TALK, TALK,
AND THAT'S ALL SHE DOES IS TALK.
   - KI-KIEA, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
           - KARINE.

       - [screams] YEAH!
    - AND ACTUALLY, NICOLE,
  IT WASN'T KARINE'S TALKING.
        IT WAS THE KIDS.
    - OH. THAT'S TRUE, TOO.

 LORD, THESE KIDS, THESE KIDS.
       YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
     - ALL RIGHT, KRISTEN.
      - MY SISTER JESSICA?
           - [sighs]

  - NOW TELL ME ABOUT JESSICA.
    - NOW YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
     TO EXPLAIN THAT, TOO.
    - EXPLAIN ABOUT JESSICA.

 - I JUST SAY HE COMPLAINS MORE
    ABOUT SPENDING TIME WITH
  MY FAMILY THAN ANYONE ELSE.
        - THAN ANYBODY?
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, PAUL?

        HE SAID OLIVIA.
         - OH. REALLY?
    - 'CAUSE SHE'S SO LAME.
           [laughter]
           - REALLY?

  - LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
   ALL RIGHT, PHIL AND JENN,

        WITH 15 POINTS.

        HERE'S THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.
  GENTLEMEN, DID YOUR WIFE SAY
      YOUR ELEVATOR SHAFT
           IS FIT FOR
     AN APARTMENT BUILDING,

      AN OFFICE BUILDING,
 OR THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING?
            KI-KIEA?
    - EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

           [laughter]
     - YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
       TO THINK ABOUT IT.
            - NOPE.
   - NICOLE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

    - EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.
     [cheers and applause]
           - [laughs]
         - OKAY, PAUL,
   YOU LOOK DEEP IN THOUGHT.

           - SHE SAID
     AN APARTMENT BUILDING,
       BECAUSE I'M GIFTED
       IN A LOT OF WAYS,
  BUT THAT'S NOT ONE OF THEM.
           - [laughs]

   WHAT DID YOU SAY, KRISTEN?
     AN APARTMENT BUILDING.
     [cheers and applause]
    - PHIL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
- I'M GONNA SAY OFFICE BUILDING.

       - OFFICE BUILDING.
   - NO MATTER WHAT I THINK,
      SHE DOESN'T WANT ME
     GETTING A BIGGER HEAD
      THAN I ALREADY HAVE,

        SO I M GONNA SAY
        OFFICE BUILDING.
       - YOU'RE GONNA SAY
    JENN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

      ALL RIGHT. HUSBANDS,
   HERE'S OUR NEXT QUESTION.
        HOW DID YOU WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
I WISH MY HUSBAND WOULD GIVE UP
 AND ADMIT HE JUST CAN'T BLANK.

             PAUL?
    - UM, GET ANYTHING DONE
       AROUND THE HOUSE?
        - OKAY. KRISTEN.

             SING.
             - OH.
          - I'M SORRY.
           - [laughs]
    - HE JUST DOES IT OFTEN.
 - YOU JUST DO IT OFTEN, OKAY.

      - RIGHT, JUST 'CAUSE
     YOU DO SOMETHING A LOT
DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE GOOD AT IT,
     HENCE ELEVATOR SHAFT.
           - [laughs]

             PHIL.
   - I ALSO WOULD PROBABLY GO
 WITH WORKING AROUND THE HOUSE.
     I DON'T LIKE DOING IT.
     I DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

THE ONLY THING I DO WHEN I DO IT
           IS CURSE.
      - WHAT KIND OF STUFF
     DON'T YOU LIKE DOING?
- ANYTHING THAT INVOLVES A TOOL.

      WELL, NOT EVERYTHING
     THAT INVOLVES A TOOL.
           - [laughs]
       I LOVE THE SMILE.
     - THE TOOLS YOU GO BUY
       AT A STORE, YEAH.

            - OKAY.
   AND WHAT'D YOU SAY, JENN?
      CLEANING. I'M SORRY.
         - THAT'S OKAY.
       WE CAN'T TAKE IT.

I DON'T WANT TO DO THAT EITHER.
  - HE DOESN'T DO THAT EITHER.
  - OKAY. ALL RIGHT, KI-KIEA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - STOP DRINKING.
     - OKAY, STOP DRINKING.

            - YEAH.
  - ALL RIGHT. WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        - I SAID DANCE.
            - DANCE.
        - OH, GOODNESS.

         WAIT A MINUTE.
  - YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T DANCE.
        - I CAN'T DANCE?
            - NOPE.
           [laughter]

     - OKAY, THEN--NO, NO.
   I-I CAN'T. I CAN'T DANCE.
       - YOU CAN'T DANCE.
        - I CAN'T DANCE.

  I-I-I-I HAVE TWO LEFT FEET.
           - MM-HMM.
     ONCE HE HITS THAT DIP
   OR THAT SLIDE, THAT'S IT.
           - [laughs]
            - NOPE.

     - ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
   THIS IS OUR NEXT QUESTION.
       I'M SURE YOUR WIFE
       LOVES YOUR FAMILY,
 AND THEY'RE SO NICE AND BLAH,
    BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

        BUT I ASKED HER
  WHAT'S THE ONE THING THEY DO
  THAT MAKES HER WISH IN-LAWS
         WERE OUTLAWED.
       WHAT DO YOU THINK
    SHE SAID, FELLAS? PHIL?

     - I DON'T KNOW. SMOKE?
        I HAVE NO IDEA.
            - OKAY.
      - MY MOM'S A SAINT.
   - JENN, IS YOUR MOM-IN-LAW
            A SAINT?

SHE BRINGS OVER SO MANY SWEETS.
           - SHE IS.
    SHE BRINGS OVER SWEETS.
   WE'RE TRYING TO GET THIN.
   - OH, SHE SPOILS ME. YEAH.

    - ALL RIGHT, WHAT WOULD
       YOU SAY, KI-KIEA?
       - THEY TALK, TALK,
    TALK, TALK, TALK, TALK.
   - NICOLE, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
   - I SAID THEY ARGUE A LOT.

    - THEY ARGUE. AND, PAUL?
   - I'M GONNA SAY THAT IT IS
      THEIR PHONE MANNER,
THE WAY THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES
         ON THE PHONE.

- HOW DO THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES
         ON THE PHONE?
- MY ENTIRE FAMILY HAS A PROBLEM
   WITH BREVITY ON THE PHONE
 WHERE THEY WILL CALL AND THEN
BEFORE THE CONVERSATION IS OVER

  THE WAY HUMANS THINK IT IS,
    THEY'VE ALREADY HUNG UP
           THE PHONE.
     - ALL RIGHT. KRISTEN?
       YOUR FLIGHTY MOM.

             - AH!
           - [laughs]
           [laughter]
           [cheering]

           - PAUL...
   - [speaking indistinctly]
   - I JUST GOT TO ASK YOU--
   PAUL, I JUST WANT TO KNOW.

    HOW'D YOU LIKE THAT PLAY
        YOUR MOM WAS IN?
       - IT WAS TERRIBLE.
           - [laughs]
  - IT WAS THE WORST ANYTHING
   I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

    - SO WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
          SOME WATER.
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
  PHIL AND JENN, YOU'RE STILL
  IN THE LEAD WITH 25 POINTS.

    STICK AROUND. OUR FINAL

ARE IN THE LEAD WITH 25 POINTS.
         NOW IT IS TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.
  IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
  THIS CAN CHANGE EVERYTHING.

  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
  USING A SCALE FROM 1 TO 10,
    WITH 10 BEING THE BEST,
   I WOULD SAY MY FIRST DATE
  WITH MY HUSBAND WAS A BLANK,

       AND THE FIRST TIME
WE CONSUMMATED OUR RELATIONSHIP
          WAS A BLANK.
            KI-KIEA?

     - OKAY, I'M GONNA SAY
         OUR FIRST DATE
            WAS A 6,
       AND THE FIRST TIME

WE CONSUMMATED OUR RELATIONSHIP
           WAS A 10.
          - ALL RIGHT.
   NICOLE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       - I SAID 5 AND 9.
        - I'M SO SORRY.

- WOW. IT WASN'T THAT MUCH FUN?
        IT WASN'T GOOD?
       - YOU FELL--YOU--
     WE WAS AT THE MOVIES.
  I HAD MY HEAD ON YOUR CHEST,
  AND THEN YOU SAID "MY TURN,"

     LIFTED ME UP, AND PUT
     YOUR HEAD ON MY CHEST.
           - [laughs]
 - NO, IT WAS NOT--IT WAS A 5.
          IT WAS A 5.

        - I'M SO SORRY,
      KI-KIEA AND NICOLE.
             PAUL?
       - OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
     SO DESPITE ALL OF MY,
  UH, TALKING ABOUT MYSELF...

           - UH-HUH.
   - THAT'S NOT SO POSITIVE,
   UH, EVERY MILESTONE IN OUR
  RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN GREAT,
   SO I'M GONNA GO FOR BROKE
        WITH 10 AND 10.

       - WITH 10 AND 10.
   KRISTEN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
           10 AND 3.
             - OH!
           [laughter]

- IT WASN'T CONSUMMATE MARRIAGE,
       IT WAS CONSUMMATE
       THE RELATIONSHIP.
          - IT'S OKAY.
 - WOULDN'T YOU AGREE AT LEAST?

   MAYBE IT WAS A 10 FOR HIM.
    - YOU WOULDN'T REMEMBER.
             - OH.
            [oohing]
     - WHO'S NEXT, SHERRI?
           - [laughs]

  BUT LOOK, PAUL AND KRISTEN,
    YOU GUYS GOT HALF RIGHT.
      YOU'RE IN THE LEAD.
YOU ARE IN THE LEAD. ALL RIGHT.
     [cheers and applause]

  - PAUL, STOP LOOKING AT HER.
            [laughs]
ALL RIGHT, PHIL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - UH, I WOULD SAY
    THE FIRST DATE WAS A 10,

  AND THE FIRST CONSUMMATION,
             UH...
        I'M AM REALIST.
       IT WAS ABOUT A 5.
    - ABOUT A 5. ALL RIGHT.
     JENN, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

  IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT...
      - YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,

  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
 WHEN YOU TWO ARE GETTIN' DIRTY
   IN THE LAUNDROMAT OF LOVE,

   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY
  IS THE ONE THING YOU'VE DONE
    THAT'S TAKEN THE STARCH
   RIGHT OUT OF HIS TROUSERS?
             KATE.

          - IF I BURP.
         - IF YOU BURP?
  - I'M A REALLY GOOD BURPER.
  HE DOESN'T LIKE IT, THOUGH.
         - OH, MY GOSH.

 OKAY. JED, WOULD THAT BURPIN'
      TAKE THE STARCH OUT
       OF YOUR TROUSERS?
     - IT ABSOLUTELY WOULD,
  BUT, UH, I REMEMBER THE TIME

     YOU ANSWERED THE PHONE
    AND TALKED TO YOUR MOM.
           - OH, MAN.
    - I DON'T REMEMBER THAT.
     - WELL, WHY WOULD YOU?

 I REMEMBER. IT TOOK THE STARCH
        OUT OF <i>MY</i> SAILS.
          - I'M SORRY.
          - I LOVE IT.
    KATE'S LIKE, "I'M SORRY,
       I DON'T REMEMBER."

            TAUSHA.
- GET UP TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.
       - YOU GOT UP TO GO
        TO THE BATHROOM?

           - MM-HMM.
         - OKAY, YOU--
     - 'CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE
          ENOUGH TIME.
 - YOU DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME?
- IT WAS AN UNEXPECTED PROPOSAL

     AND I WASN'T PREPARED,
         SO I HAD TO GO
     TO THE BATHROOM FIRST.
          - ALL RIGHT.
      RON, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

 RON SAID WHEN YOU BROKE WIND.
 - I SAID WHEN YOU BROKE WIND.
            - TINA.
   - LIKE, CHECKING MY PHONE,
   A TEXT MESSAGE OR E-MAIL.

       - DO YOU DO THAT--
     DO YOU DO THAT A LOT?
  - IF IT--MAYBE IT WENT OFF,
    OR SOMETHING BUSY WAS--
     IF I HAD--MY MIND WAS
 SOMEWHERE ELSE. I DON'T KNOW.

    - YOUR MIND WOULDN'T BE
          WITH KEVIN?
            - YEAH.
        - I DON'T KNOW.
 - IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WITH ME.

    - I MEAN, I WOULD THINK
    IT WOULD BE WITH KEVIN,
        THAT IF YOU'RE--
     - IT--IT NORMALLY IS.
        - [mouths word]

  - HE SAID DISTRACTED BY TV.
   - I SAID DISTRACTED BY TV.
     - THAT'S YOU. YOU GET
     DISTRACTED BY THE TV.
     - I'M ALWAYS FOCUSED.

       - WHY'S THE TV ON?
        - I DON'T KNOW,
       AND IT'S SOMETIMES
       LIKE <i>SportsCenter,</i>
         AND I'M LIKE--
- THAT'S THE BEST WAY TO DO IT.

     - ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE
        WHERE WE STAND.
    RON AND TAUSHA, YOU GUYS
     ARE TIED FOR THE LEAD
      WITH KEVIN AND TINA.
    YOU BOTH HAVE 5 POINTS.

       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT'S THE LADIES' TURN
      TO ANSWER QUESTIONS,
  AND THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED,
         SO STAY TUNED.

  I'LL GO EAST COAST FOR THE
  PHILLY CHEESESTEAK OMELETTE.
 NO, LET'S GO TO THE HEARTLAND
    FOR THE MIDWESTERN MEAT
    & POTATOES SANDWICH.

        WAIT UMM, YEAH.
    TRY THE SEVEN REGIONALLY
    INSPIRED DISHES
  OF THE TOUR OF AMERICA MENU.

         Only at Sears.
      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT
   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,

  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.
      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.

     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD
TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.

IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.
      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,

      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.
   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.

   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE
FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.

      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,
   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,

    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,
     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.

    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,
AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,

    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE
   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.

  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM
 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.

 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.
 ALL RIGHT, LADIES, IT IS YOUR
TURN TO ANSWER A FEW QUESTIONS.
     THESE NEXT 3 ARE WORTH
        10 POINTS EACH.

      ARE YOU READY TO GO?
             - YEP.
            - OKAY.
IF YOUR HUSBAND AND YOUR FRIENDS
  WERE PLAYING A NUDE VERSION

     OF DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE,
      WHO WOULD HE LIKELY
   KEEP PICKING AS THE GOOSE
   JUST SO HE COULD HAVE HER
    CHASE HIM AROUND NAKED?

            TAUSHA.
- I WOULD SAY MY FRIEND DIONNE.
    - TELL ME ABOUT DIONNE.
     - SHE HAS BIG BREASTS.
             - AHH.

        ALL RIGHT. TINA.
- UH, MY SISTER'S FRIEND LEINNA,
      BECAUSE SHE'S, LIKE,
        A HOT NUMBER...

            - YEAH.
 - AND SHE'S GOT THE--YOU KNOW.
   - I LOVE TINA. SHE'S LIKE,
    "'CAUSE SHE'S GOT THE--
 YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW, WHATEVER."
             - NO.

         - OKAY. KATE.
   - MY FRIEND AMANDA, FOR--
APPARENTLY WE ALL HAVE BOOB MEN,
    BECAUSE THE SAME THING.

          - ALL RIGHT.
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
     I ALWAYS FEEL AWKWARD
    WHEN WE'RE OUT IN PUBLIC

AND MY HUSBAND STARTS TO BLANK.
             TINA.
       - HE JUST MAKES UP
       RANDOM CHARACTERS

   AND JUST TRIES TO BE FUNNY
         ALL THE TIME,
        AND HE WILL JUST
      MAKE UP A CHARACTER
    AND ACT LIKE THAT PERSON
        WHILE WE'RE OUT,

    AND TRY TO EMBARRASS ME
           IN PUBLIC.
- REALLY? IS THERE ONE FAVORITE
       CHARACTER HE DOES?
    - HE DOES THIS CHARACTER
   OF THIS SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN

       WITH NO UPPER LIP.
       - ALL RIGHT. KATE.
      - CHECK HIS E-MAILS.

  LIKE, IF WE'RE OUT TO DINNER
    WITH FRIENDS OR ANYONE,
   AND SUDDENLY HE PULLS OUT
          THAT THING.
      THAT MAKES ME CRAZY.

  - ALL RIGHT, WHEN HE CHECKS
      THE E-MAILS. TAUSHA.
    - I WANT TO SAY HE ACTS
        VERY NONCHALANT.
- REALLY? SO HE'S KIND OF ALOOF?
       - YEAH, HE JUST--

HE JUST BE LIKE, "WELL, I DON'T
     HAVE NOTHIN' TO SAY."
           YOU KNOW.
            - OKAY.
     LADIES, NEXT QUESTION.

         PUNCTUALITY IS
   AN UNDERAPPRECIATED TRAIT,
      SO LET'S THINK BACK
  TO YOUR FIRST DATE TOGETHER.
     WHO SHOWED UP FIRST--

       YOU, YOUR HUSBAND,
      OR YOU BOTH ARRIVED
       AT THE SAME TIME?
             KATE.

     - I THINK MY HUSBAND.
        - YOUR HUSBAND?
            - YEAH.
           - TAUSHA.
- I MADE HIM--LIKE, KIND OF TOLD
   HIM TO COME AHEAD OF TIME,

      SO HE WOULD BE THERE
       WHEN I GET THERE,
      'CAUSE AT THAT TIME,
  I DIDN'T KNOW HOW HOW HIS--
 YOU KNOW, HOW ON TIME HE WAS,
       BUT HE ACTUALLY--

     - AND YOU WERE THE ONE
         THAT WAS LATE.
       - AND I WAS LATE,
       BUT HE WAS FIRST.
       - ALL RIGHT. TINA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - OUR FIRST DATE WAS WE WERE
  OUT WITH A BUNCH OF PEOPLE,
       AND THEN EVERYONE
     KIND OF TRICKLED OFF,
     AND THEN IT WAS, LIKE,
          JUST US TWO,

  AND THEN WE ENDED UP, LIKE,
    WALKING AROUND THE CITY
   TILL 6:00 IN THE MORNING,
     AND JUST, LIKE, HAVING
   THIS, LIKE, CRAZY ROMANTIC
       SPONTANEOUS DATE,

     SO WE WERE BOTH THERE
    AT REALLY THE SAME TIME.
       - OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
        LADIES, HERE IS
       A BONUS QUESTION.

        IT HAS 2 PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.
          IF YOU WERE
   TO COME UP WITH A NICKNAME

   FOR YOUR HUSBAND'S MANHOOD
     BY COMBINING THE CITY
         HE WAS BORN IN
    AND YOUR BIGGEST PHOBIA,
       WHAT WOULD IT BE?

            TAUSHA.
            - BRICK.
 - OKAY, SO HE'S FROM BRICK...
- HE'S FROM NEWARK, NEW JERSEY,

     BUT HE'S ALWAYS KNOWN
    IT AS, LIKE, BRICK CITY.
- SO WE HAVE TO GO WITH NEWARK,
    BECAUSE IT'S IN NEWARK.
             - YES.
            - OKAY.

      - I WOULD SAY NEWARK
          AND STARING,
     PEOPLE STARING AT ME.
   - SO HIS MANHOOD WOULD BE
        NEWARK STARING.

    - HIS MANHOOD IS BRICK.
 - SO PUT THAT IN PARENTHESES.
            - RIGHT.
            - TINA.

 - HIS MANHOOD WOULD BE CALLED
     THE BUFFALO COCKROACH.
    - THE BUFFALO COCKROACH.
            - YEAH.

       - THAT SOUNDS LIKE
    IT COULD DO SOME DAMAGE.
     KATE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - UM, HE WAS BORN IN A SUBURB
      OF DETROIT, I GUESS,

        AND I DON'T LIKE
       TO FLY IN PLANES.
      UM, AND NOW HE SAYS,
 "OH, YOU'RE AFRAID OF FLYING."
            I SAID,
 "NO, I'M AFRAID OF CRASHING."

           - MM-HMM.
  - SO MAYBE IT WOULD BE LIKE,
      UM, DETROIT FLYING.
  - DETROIT FLYING. ALL RIGHT.
            - YEAH.

  - LADIES, THANK YOU SO MUCH.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
    WE'LL SEE JUST HOW WELL
         THEIR HUSBANDS
    CAN MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

    TO SEE IF THEY CAN MATCH

 THE ANSWERS THEIR WIVES GAVE.
       ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
       HERE IS THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.

 IF YOU AND YOUR WIFE'S FRIENDS
  WERE PLAYING A NUDE VERSION
     OF DUCK, DUCK, GOOSE,
     WHO DID YOUR WIFE SAY

        YOU WOULD LIKELY
   KEEP PICKING AS THE GOOSE
   JUST SO YOU COULD HAVE HER
    CHASE YOU AROUND NAKED?
              RON.

           - DIONNE.
  - TAUSHA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
            DIONNE.

    WHO'S VERY WELL-ENDOWED.
          - ALL RIGHT.

         - WITH ROBIN.
OKAY, YOUR HANDS GOT FURTHER OUT
   AS YOU TALKED ABOUT ROBIN.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

      - I DON'T KNOW HER.
      I'VE SEEN HER ONCE.
         BUT SHE WAS...
  - ROBIN'S LIKE YOUR SISTER.

        - NO, SHE'S NOT.
  - NO, SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT.
     SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT.
- OKAY, NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU, JED?
      - HER FRIEND AMANDA.
           - AMANDA.

            - YEAH.
     AMANDA FITS THE MOLD.
     - SO AMANDA ABSOLUTELY
         FITS THE MOLD.
     - YES, EXACTLY RIGHT.

    I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
   - I AM HERE FOR YOU, JED.
          - THANK YOU.
- I FEEL YOU. I'M HERE FOR YOU.
           - [laughs]

        - I SAID AMANDA.
           - AMANDA.
        - OH, THANK YOU.
   THANK YOU FOR KNOWING ME.

 - SO, HUSBANDS, NEXT QUESTION.
       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
     I ALWAYS FEEL AWKWARD
    WHEN WE'RE OUT IN PUBLIC

AND MY HUSBAND STARTS TO BLANK.
             KEVIN.
  - I'LL DO A FUNNY CHARACTER
         OR SOMETHING.

 - WHAT'S A CHARACTER YOU LIKE?
          - ONE NIGHT,
     WE WERE OUT AT DINNER,
  AND I THOUGHT IT'D BE FUNNY
  TO PRETEND I HAD ROBOT ARMS.

        AND I JUST KEPT
     KNOCKING THINGS OVER.
   "THIS IS A WONDERFUL DAY."
        - SO WHEN YOU GO
     INTO YOUR CHARACTERS.

         - YEAH, YEAH.
- OKAY, TINA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
            - I SAID
    WHEN HE DOES CHARACTERS.
       - BUT NOW, KEVIN,
      THERE'S A CHARACTER

   THAT TINA TELLS US ABOUT--
      A SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN
        WITH NO TOP LIP?
 - [Southern accent] I'M A FINE
       SOUTHERN GENTLEMAN

    WITH NO UPPER LIP, OKAY.
    SO WHEN--WHEN IT RAINS,
 I KIND OF DROWN A LITTLE BIT.
 [normal voice] SO THAT'S ONE.
     I GOT A BUNCH OF 'EM.

     - THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
     OH, MY GOSH. LOVE IT.
              JED.
     - I-I THINK THE THING
     THAT--THAT KATE HATES

       FOR ME TO DO MOST
      IS--IS YELL AT HER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    KATE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - I DO HATE THAT, BUT YOU
 HAVEN'T DONE THAT IN SO LONG.

 BUT I CAN'T STAND THE E-MAILS,
       WHEN YOU'RE ALWAYS
CHECKING YOUR E-MAIL WHEN WE'RE
  OUT TO DINNER WITH FRIENDS.
 - OH, YEAH, ON MY BlackBerry.
      - YEAH, I HATE THAT.

     - RON, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
           - I CUSS,
   AND I CUSS LIKE A SAILOR.
            - OKAY.
   TAUSHA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    WHEN YOU ACT NONCHALANT.

         - NONCHALANT.
             - OH.
  - YOU KNOW, LIKE HOW YOU'RE
     ACTING RIGHT NOW, RON.
    - RIGHT, RIGHT, EXACTLY.

     - ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
         NEXT QUESTION.
          PUNCTUALITY
 IS AN UNDERAPPRECIATED TRAIT.
      SO LET'S THINK BACK
  TO YOUR FIRST DATE TOGETHER.

    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,
     WHO SHOWED UP FIRST--
           YOU, HER,
      OR YOU BOTH ARRIVED
       AT THE SAME TIME?

              JED.
     - I'M REALLY NOT SURE,
 BUT I THINK SHE ARRIVED FIRST.
             KATE.
  - NO, YOU WERE THERE FIRST.

- WHAT WAS OUR FIRST DATE, THEN?
   - WE'LL GO OVER IT LATER.
             - RON.
    - TAUSHA ARRIVED FIRST.

            - OKAY.
 - SHE'S THIS ORGANIZED PERSON.
     EVERYTHING IS INTACT.

     SHE WILL DOT EVERY "I"
      AND CROSS EVERY "T."
            TAUSHA.
       YOU ARRIVED FIRST.
      - YOU ARRIVED FIRST.
   - NO, YOU GOT THERE FIRST.

       - NO, BECAUSE WHEN
   I CAME DOWN THE ESCALATOR,
    YOU WERE STANDING THERE
       WITH YOUR FRIEND.
   - BUT YOU WERE THERE. NO.
- WHEN YOU MET ME AT THE TRAIN.

      OH, ARE YOU SERIOUS?
 - NO, I WASN'T. GET IT RIGHT.
       - OH, MY GOODNESS.
     - WHO GOT THERE FIRST?
           - HE DID.
           - SHE DID.

          IT WAS YOU.
        - NO, IT WASN'T.
         NO, IT WASN'T.
      - ALL RIGHT, KEVIN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - SHE WAS OUT WITH SOME
  WORK FRIENDS GETTING DRINKS,
    AND THEN I MET HER OUT,
        SO I'M GONNA SAY
    THAT SHE ARRIVED FIRST.

   - THAT SHE ARRIVED FIRST.
            - YEAH.
- OKAY, TINA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - I SAID WE WERE BOTH
  AT THE SAME TIME, BECAUSE IT

WASN'T REALLY TECHNICALLY A DATE
     UNTIL EVERYBODY LEFT.
      - UNTIL IT STARTED.
            - YEAH.
   - YOU WERE TECHNICALLY IN
THE BUILDING BEFORE I GOT THERE,

  SO I'M RIGHT, AND I'M JUST--
    I MEAN, IT'S NOT ABOUT--
    AND IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT.
  - LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.

RON AND TAUSHA, YOU'RE STILL IN
 THE LEAD WITH KEVIN AND TINA.
    YOU BOTH HAVE 15 POINTS.
         STICK AROUND.
    OUR FINAL BONUS QUESTION
         IS COMING UP,

AND IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS,
      SO ANYBODY CAN WIN.
         DON'T GO AWAY.
So anyway, I've been to a lot of
            places.

 You know, I've helped a lot of
  people save a lot of money.
But today...( <i>SFX: Loud noise of</i>
<i>large metal object hitting the</i>
             <i>ground)</i>
   things have been a little
            strange.

  <i>(SFX: Sound of piano smashing)</i>
     Roadrunner: Meep meep.
           Meep meep?

      <i>(SFX: Loud thud sound)</i>
     What a strange place.
 GEICO®. Fifteen minutes could
save you fifteen percent or more
       on car insurance.

  RON AND TAUSHA, YOU ARE TIED
      WITH KEVIN AND TINA
        FOR FIRST PLACE.
    YOU BOTH HAVE 15 POINTS.
     THIS IS A TIGHT GAME.

   ALL RIGHT, NOW IT IS TIME
    FOR OUR FINAL QUESTION.
  IT IS WORTH UP TO 30 POINTS.
      ARE YOU GUYS READY?
          all: READY.

         - HERE WE GO.
           ALL RIGHT.
  GENTLEMEN, I ASKED YOUR WIFE
   TO COME UP WITH A NICKNAME
        FOR YOUR MANHOOD

     BY COMBINING THE CITY
        YOU WERE BORN IN
    AND HER BIGGEST PHOBIA.
  WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE SAID?

    JED, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
         - UH, UH, BOY.
         SO I WAS BORN
    IN ANN ARBOR, MICHIGAN.

    AND HER BIGGEST PHOBIA,
          NOT FLYING,
         BUT CRASHING.
            - OKAY.

      - SO SHE DEFINITELY
      IS AN ANXIOUS FLYER,
BUT SHE'S NOT SCARED OF FLYING,
       IT'S THE CRASHING.
      - IT'S THE CRASHING.
            - YEAH.

    - SO ANN ARBOR CRASHING.
   - KATE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
- WELL, I THOUGHT YOU WERE BORN

         RIGHT INTO IT.
  THIS IS OUR FIRST QUESTION,
           HUSBANDS.

    ON THE DAY YOU PROPOSED
         TO YOUR WIFE,
       WHAT WAS BIGGER--
    HER RING, HER REACTION,

 OR HER READINESS TO PLEASE YOU
       LATER THAT NIGHT?
              BEN?
   - UM, I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
         HER REACTION.

        - HER REACTION.
  - SHE WAS WAITING FOR MONTHS
 AND MONTHS FOR ME TO PROPOSE,
   AND SHE JUST FREAKED OUT,

 AND THEN HER PARENTS CAME IN,
     AND THEY FREAKED OUT.
            - YEAH.
 - SO DEFINITELY HER REACTION.
         - OKAY. CHRIS?

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
       REACTION AS WELL.
    - HER REACTION AS WELL?
  - YEAH, SHE BROKE DOWN INTO
 TEARS, AND, UH, IT WAS GREAT.

        - OKAY. ZACHARY?
   - HER READINESS TO PLEASE.
             - OH!

            REALLY?
             - YES.
    IT WAS SEVEN LONG YEARS
   BEFORE IT HAPPENED, SO...
          - OH, OKAY.
       SO SHE WAS READY.

           - MM-HMM.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       GENTLEMEN, THIS IS
       OUR NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--

I WOULDN'T SAY MY WIFE IS A NAG,
BUT SHE IS CONSTANTLY BUGGING ME
          ABOUT BLANK.
             CHRIS?

   - MAKING SURE THE KITCHEN
           IS CLEAN.
         - MAKING SURE
      THE KITCHEN'S CLEAN?
      - YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

      - YOU STRUGGLE WITH
     CLEANING THE KITCHEN?
            - YEAH.
  - OH, IT'S SUCH AN EMOTIONAL
         DEAL FOR YOU?

         - ABSOLUTELY.
     - ALL RIGHT. ZACHARY?
    - SHE COMPLAINS ABOUT ME
   NOT TALKING ENOUGH TO HER
         ABOUT HER DAY
       AT WORK AND STUFF.

          - OKAY. BEN?
         - SHE NAGS ME
     ABOUT SO MANY THINGS.
      I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
       GETTING A HAIRCUT.

SHE'S ALWAYS, ALWAYS TELLING ME
       TO GET A HAIRCUT.
    - YEAH, YOU JUST GROW IT
           TOO LONG?
      - I DON'T THINK SO.
          - OH, OKAY.

          - SHE DOES.
 - THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION,
           GENTLEMEN.

        WHEN SHE REDUCED
     THE SIZE OF HER LIPS.
 WHICH PART OF YOUR WIFE'S BODY
  WOULD SHE WANT TO DOWNSIZE?
            ZACHARY?

       - WELL, RIGHT NOW,
     SINCE SHE'S PREGNANT,
          HER BREASTS.
         - HER BREASTS
    SHE'D WANT TO DOWNSIZE?

       - YEAH, THEY KINDA
           BLEW UP...
  - YEAH, THEY'RE PRETTY HUGE?
       - SINCE THE--YEAH.
          - OKAY. BEN?

      - I THINK HER MOUTH.
 SHE'S--SHE'S GOT A BIG MOUTH.
- WOULD THAT BE HER DESCRIPTION
           OR YOURS?

      - NO, I THINK SHE--
    I THINK SHE REALIZES IT.
     SHE'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
        THAT GOES ALONG
       WITH THE NAGGING.

   - OKAY, SO SHE WOULD WANT
     TO DOWNSIZE HER MOUTH?
     - THAT'LL BE A PROBLEM
         FOR ME LATER.
- YOU CAN HEAR FROM THE CROWD'S
 REACTION, YOU ARE IN TROUBLE.

     - I TRY--THEY TOLD US
        TO BE TRUTHFUL.
        - OH, ALL RIGHT.
             CHRIS?
 - I'M GONNA GO WITH HER ARMS.

        - WITH HER ARMS?
            - YEAH.
        - WHY HER ARMS?
   - THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION,
            AND, UH,

      IT WAS JUST A SAFE--
     SAFEST ANSWER FOR ME.
   - IT'S THE SAFEST ANSWER.
             OKAY.
    WELL, FELLAS, THANK YOU.

    BACK THERE FOR A WHILE,
        JUST THINKING--
   HAD A LOT OF TIME TO THINK

             ABOUT,
    WHAT DID MY HUSBAND SAY?
        ALL RIGHT, WELL,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,

  AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB TO TRY
    AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
  EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS WORTH
 5 POINTS. HERE WE GO, LADIES.
    ON THE DAY YOUR HUSBAND
        PROPOSED TO YOU,

  WHAT DID HE SAY WAS BIGGER--
   YOUR RING, YOUR REACTION,
       OR YOUR READINESS
TO PLEASE HIM LATER THAT NIGHT?

            BROOKE?
   - I WOULD SAY MY REACTION.
   - WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?

- I WAS SHOCKED, BUT HE MADE ME
 DANCE WITH HIM IN THE KITCHEN,
     AND HE WAS JUST BEING
         REALLY WEIRD--
      'CAUSE HE'S WEIRD--

          UH, AND, UM,
    I WOULD SAY MY REACTION.
  - YOUR REACTION, ALL RIGHT.
             - YEP.
    - BEN, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

         YOUR REACTION.
         AND STEPHANIE?
          - OH, JEEZ.

       I WOULD SAY MAYBE
            MY RING?
          - YOUR RING?
    OH, LET'S SEE YOUR RING.
      OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL,

    SO YOUR RING WAS BIGGER.
           ALL RIGHT.
    CHRIS, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
         YOUR REACTION.

     WAS THAT THE REACTION?
            - YEAH.
  I AM DOING HER REACTION NOW,
      AS SHE DID THAT DAY.

  - I WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED.
     - ALL RIGHT. PATRICIA?
           - I'LL SAY

  MY READINESS TO PLEASE HIM.
   IT'S KIND OF COMPLICATED,
             BUT...
   - WHY IS THAT COMPLICATED?

        - WELL, HE, UM,
            GAVE ME
     A PROMISE RING FIRST,
         AND THEN I GOT
    MY REAL ENGAGEMENT RING

   THAT I PICKED OUT LATER...
          - ALL RIGHT.
   - SO THE INITIAL PROPOSAL
     WAS MORE MY REACTION--
       LIKE, MY READINESS
    TO PLEASE HIM, I'D SAY.

   - OKAY, SO YOU WERE HAPPY,
       TOO, HUH, ZACHARY?
            [laughs]
           ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, ZACHARY?

   YOUR READINESS TO PLEASE.
  SO I HEAR YOU'RE EXPECTING,
           PATRICIA?
   - YES, HENCE MY READINESS
           TO PLEASE.

           [laughter]
    - WELL, CONGRATULATIONS
  ON THIS BLESSING RIGHT HERE
     THAT YOU'RE CARRYING.

         YOU LOOK LIKE
      YOU'RE ABOUT READY.
             - YES.
   - YOU'RE READY TO GO HOME
         AND LAY DOWN.

      - ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
   OUR NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
 HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND COMPLETE
        THIS SENTENCE--

     I WOULDN'T SAY MY WIFE
           IS A NAG,
BUT SHE IS CONSTANTLY BUGGING ME
          ABOUT BLANK?
           STEPHANIE?

     - MAYBE WHEN OUR NEXT
       TRIP IS GONNA BE,
 'CAUSE WE'RE ALWAYS TRAVELING.
     - WHEN YOUR NEXT TRIP
      IS GONNA BE. CHRIS?

        HE SAID CLEANING
          THE KITCHEN.
     - 0-FOR-2. IT'S GOING
    EXACTLY HOW WE THOUGHT.
           [laughter]

    - OKAY. WHAT ABOUT YOU,
           PATRICIA?
      - GET ME ICE CREAM,
         AT THIS POINT.
    - TO GET YOU ICE CREAM.

    ZACHARY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
    - THAT'S JUST RECENTLY.
  - NOT TALKING TO YOU ENOUGH.

       - OH, THAT'S TRUE.
 - AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, BROOKE?
        - STOP HUMMING.
        - STOP HUMMING?

     - HE'S ALWAYS HUMMING,
         ALL THE TIME.
HE NEVER SHUTS HIS MOUTH, EVER.
   - DOES--WHAT DOES HE HUM?
 - BROADWAY SHOWS OR SOMETHING,
         I DON'T KNOW.

         - SHOW TUNES?
   - YEAH, I LIKE SHOW TUNES.
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT.
 - SHOW MY SOME HUMMING YOU DO.
          - OH, MAN--

          - [humming]
      - YEAH, YOU KNOW...
  - REALLY LOUD ALL THE TIME.
     - MAKES YOU SO HAPPY.

            - YEAH.
       I'M A MUSICAL MAN.
        - OKAY. SO WHAT
       DID YOU PUT, BEN?
       - THE OTHER THING
    THAT SHE BUGS ME ABOUT.

      - GETTING A HAIRCUT.
           - MM-HMM.
        - SHE KNOWS IT.
       - YEAH, I KNOW IT.
- DID YOU JUST HUM THAT MM-HMM?

           [laughter]
       - I CAN'T HELP IT.
    - OKAY, LADIES, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.

    REALITY STAR LISA RINNA
        CAUSED A FRENZY
        WHEN SHE REDUCED
     THE SIZE OF HER LIPS.
    WHICH PART OF YOUR BODY
      DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY

  YOU WOULD WANT TO DOWNSIZE?
           PATRICIA?
          - MY THIGHS.
   - YOUR THIGHS. ALL RIGHT.
    ZACHARY, WHAT'D YOU SAY?

         YOUR BREASTS.
            - WHAT?
  - NOW THAT YOU'RE PREGNANT.

- THEY HAVEN'T GROWN THAT MUCH.
       - YEAH, THEY HAVE.
           - BROOKE?
           - MY BUTT.
          - YOUR BUTT?

            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.
      - IT'S A LITTLE BIG.
 - AND WHAT'D YOUR HUSBAND SAY?
      HE SAID YOUR MOUTH.

           - REALLY?
   - I'M GONNA HEAR ABOUT IT
             LATER.
          - I TOLD YOU
 YOU WERE GONNA HEAR ABOUT IT.

     HE KIND OF WENT ALONG
   WITH THE NAGGING QUESTION.
    - YEAH, OKAY. ALL RIGHT.
      ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.
   - IT'S LIKE A DUAL THING.

- SHE'S LIKE, "WHATEVER, OKAY."
           STEPHANIE?
    - I WOULD SAY MY THIGHS,
        BECAUSE HE LOVES
     MY BUTT AND MY BOOBS.

  - OKAY, SO YOUR THIGHS. ALL
 RIGHT, CHRIS, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
     - I TOLD YOU THERE WAS
    NO RIGHT ANSWER TO THIS.
      - HE SAID YOUR ARMS.
            - WHAT?

            MY ARMS?
   - THERE'S NO RIGHT ANSWER.
       - NO RIGHT ANSWER.
   LET'S SEE WHERE WE STAND.
     OKAY, BEN AND BROOKE,
 YOU GUYS ARE TIED FOR THE LEAD

     THESE NEXT 3 QUESTIONS
   ARE WORTH 10 POINTS EACH.
         ARE YOU READY?
             - YES.

   - OKAY. WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
         IS LEFT ALONE
     TO BAKE HIS OWN CAKE,
        WHAT DOES HE USE
       FOR INSPIRATION--

    A PAST BAKING EXPERIENCE
           WITH YOU,
    A COMPUTER BASED RECIPE,
          OR HE CLAIMS
     HE DOESN'T BAKE ALONE?

            BROOKE?
      - A COMPUTER BASED--
  I'VE SEEN IT. IT'S NOT GOOD.
        YEAH, IT'S BIG.

   - A COMPUTER BASED RECIPE.
     ALL RIGHT. STEPHANIE?
 - I'D SAY A BAKING EXPERIENCE
            WITH ME,
 EVEN THOUGH IT DIDN'T TURN OUT
    VERY GOOD THE LAST TIME,

    'CAUSE WE HELPED HIS MOM
      BAKE A 3-LAYER CAKE.
             YEAH.
     - SO YOU'RE SAYING...

           [laughter]
   - HIS MOM HAS TO HELP HIM
          BAKE A CAKE?

      - NO, NO, NO. I DO.
- OKAY, 'CAUSE THAT SOUNDS LIKE
 YEARS OF THERAPY RIGHT THERE.

      ALL RIGHT, PATRICIA?
      - UM, I'D SAY A PAST
   BAKING EXPERIENCE WITH ME.
   - A PAST BAKING EXPERIENCE
           WITH YOU.

            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.
        LADIES, THIS IS
       OUR NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--

      I HOPE THERE'S NEVER
   AN EMERGENCY IN OUR HOUSE
 WHERE MY HUSBAND HAS TO CHOOSE
      BETWEEN RESCUING ME
         OR HIS BLANK,

      BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
      WHICH ONE HE'D PICK.
           STEPHANIE?
  - RESCUING ME OR HIS PHONE.

        - OR HIS PHONE?
   - HE'S ALWAYS ON HIS PHONE
     DOING FANTASY SOCCER.
          - OH, OKAY.
     - SO YEAH, HIS PHONE.

          - PATRICIA.
     - UH, I'D SAY THE DOG.
   EVEN THOUGH IT'S OUR DOG,
      IT'S REALLY HIS DOG.

   - WHAT KIND OF DOG IS IT?
     - IT'S A RAT TERRIER.
          - OH, ONE OF
     THE LITTLE ONES, HUH?
            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.

            BROOKE?
 - I'D SAY HIS COMPUTER, 'CAUSE
  REMEMBER WHAT I SAID BEFORE?
 - YEAH, IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP
THOSE RECIPES OUT OF HARM'S WAY.

     - THAT'S RIGHT, YEAH.
           - I KNOW.
   ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION,
            LADIES.
    WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND DO
          TO CELEBRATE

   YOUR FIRST VALENTINE'S DAY
      TOGETHER? PATRICIA?
    - THAT'S WHEN HE GAVE ME
    THE PROMISE RING AND...
           - UH-HUH.
      - KIND OF PROPOSED.

 - SO THAT WAS THE PROMISE RING
      THAT HE GAVE TO YOU,
  YOUR FIRST VALENTINE'S DAY.
         - YEAH. YEAH.
        - OKAY. BROOKE?

     - HE COOKED ME DINNER
          AT MY HOUSE.
 HE COOKED ME RAW CORNISH HEN.
  IT WASN'T DONE ALL THE WAY.
 - IT SOUNDS LIKE HE WAS TRYING
          TO KILL YOU.

            - YEAH.
 - BUT, I MEAN, THAT'S JUST ME.
           STEPHANIE?
   - HE GOT CHOCOLATE COVERED
  STRAWBERRIES AND CHAMPAGNE,

      AND WE ENJOYED THAT
       AT HIS APARTMENT.
   - SOUNDS GOOD. HIS MOTHER
  DIDN'T SUPPLY THAT, DID SHE,
         FOR YOU GUYS?
             - NO.

          - NO, OKAY.
LADIES, HERE'S A BONUS QUESTION.
   IT HAS 2 PARTS. EACH PART
IS WORTH 15 POINTS. HERE WE GO.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--

 WE THOUGHT WE KNEW EACH OTHER
          PRETTY WELL,
      BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL
      WE MOVED IN TOGETHER
 THAT I DISCOVERED MY HUSBAND'S
        KNACK FOR BLANK,

 AND HE LEARNED ABOUT MY TALENT
           FOR BLANK.
            BROOKE?
    - HIS KNACK FOR COOKING.

             - YEP.
      - I THOUGHT HE MADE
       RAW CORNISH HENS?
  - I MEAN, THAT WAS ONE TIME.
       USUALLY HE'S GOOD.

   - OH, OKAY, AND HE LEARNED
  ABOUT YOUR TALENT FOR BLANK?
       - LAYING IN MY BED
         ALL THE TIME.
  - LIKE, NOT DOING ANYTHING.
   - LIKE, NOT EVEN WITH HIM.

   - JUST LAYING IN THE BED.
       - OKAY. STEPHANIE?
 - HOW MUCH HE WATCHES SOCCER.
HE'S JUST OBSESSED WITH SOCCER.

  - HE'S OBSESSED WITH SOCCER,
           ALL RIGHT,
      AND HE LEARNED ABOUT
     YOUR TALENT FOR BLANK?
          - MAYBE, UM,

       DOING THE DISHES,
  BECAUSE HE NEVER DOES THEM.
       - SO HE FOUND OUT
 YOU'RE A TALENTED DISHWASHER?
     - YEAH. I GUESS, YEAH.
       - OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

         AND PATRICIA?
- UM, I LEARNED ABOUT HIS KNACK
 FOR BEING ABLE TO FIX THINGS,
     'CAUSE WE GOT A HOUSE,
AND IT NEEDED A LOT OF REPAIRS,

   AND HE DID MOST OF THAT...
          - ALL RIGHT.
- AND HE LEARNED ABOUT MY TALENT
   FOR BEING MESSY, I'LL SAY.

       - FOR BEING MESSY.
            - YEAH.
      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

   LET'S CHECK ON THE SCORE.
      SO, BEN AND BROOKE,
  YOU ARE TIED FOR FIRST PLACE

   WITH ZACHARY AND PATRICIA.
    YOU BOTH HAVE 5 POINTS.
      CHRIS AND STEPHANIE,
 YOU DON'T HAVE ANY POINTS YET,
    BUT WE'RE NOT EVEN DONE,

       SO, NO, DON'T CRY.
    WIPE THOSE TEARS, CHRIS.
     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
       HERE IS THE FIRST
   OF OUR 10-POINT QUESTIONS.

     WHEN YOU'RE LEFT ALONE
     TO BAKE YOUR OWN CAKE,
 WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY YOU USE
       FOR INSPIRATION--

    A PAST BAKING EXPERIENCE
           WITH HER,
    A COMPUTER BASED RECIPE,
          OR YOU CLAIM
     YOU DON'T BAKE ALONE?

              BEN?
     - UM, I'M ONLY HUMAN.
      I WOULD SAY PROBABLY
       A COMPUTER RECIPE.

- A COMPUTER RECIPE, ALL RIGHT.
 - THEY HAVE THE BEST RECIPES.
           - GOTCHA.
   BROOKE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  SOME COMPUTER BASED RECIPES.

             CHRIS?
     - I DON'T BAKE ALONE.
    - YOU DON'T BAKE ALONE.
  WHAT DID YOU SAY, STEPHANIE?

   STEPHANIE SAID PAST BAKING
      EXPERIENCE WITH HER.
    - ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
 - THERE WAS ONE POINT IN THERE
    I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED,

     'CAUSE STEPHANIE SAID
     YOUR MOTHER HELPED YOU
BAKE SOME STUFF, AND I COULDN'T
       FIGURE OUT WHAT...
           [laughter]

    - THIS IS GOING EXACTLY
   HOW I THOUGHT IT WOULD GO.
- IN ALL YOUR FANTASIES OF BEING
     ON <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>
          THIS IS IT.
           - OH, BOY.

       - [clears throat]
     - ALL RIGHT, ZACHARY?
    - PAST BAKING EXPERIENCE
           WITH HER.

          - ALL RIGHT.
  PATRICIA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     PAST BAKING EXPERIENCE
      ALL RIGHT, HUSBANDS,
         NEXT QUESTION.

       HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
      I HOPE THERE'S NEVER
   AN EMERGENCY IN OUR HOUSE
 WHERE MY HUSBAND HAS TO CHOOSE

      BETWEEN RESCUING ME
         OR HIS BLANK,
      BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE
      WHICH ONE HE'D PICK.
             CHRIS?

       - I'D HAVE TO SAY
         MY CELL PHONE.
          - YOU SAID--
      ARE YOU ON IT A LOT?

           - FINALLY.
     - ALL RIGHT, ZACHARY?
  - THIS ONE'S EASY--THE DOG.
          - YOUR DOG.

             - YES.
   THAT'S YOUR BABY, THE DOG?
            - OKAY.
  PATRICIA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

         SAID THE DOG.
    AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, BEN?
   - UH, THIS KIND OF TIES IN
    WITH THE LAST QUESTION.

     I WOULD SAY COMPUTER.
        - YOUR COMPUTER.
      WOW, YOU REALLY WANT
           TO BE ABLE
TO HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE RECIPES.
   - NOT FOR THE SAME REASON.

          I, YOU KNOW,
     I HAVE WORK ON THERE.
