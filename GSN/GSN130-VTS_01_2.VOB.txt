      YOUR WIVES BACKSTAGE

       SO WE CAN ASK YOU
        SOME QUESTIONS.
          WE WILL GET
     RIGHT INTO IT, FELLAS.
   IS THE MOST PRIVATE THING
    YOU HAVE IN YOUR BEDROOM

 HIDDEN IN ONE OF YOUR DRAWERS,
  ONE OF YOUR WIFE'S DRAWERS,
OR SOMEWHERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT?
           - [laughs]

     - YOU LAUGHED, THOMAS.
              WHY?
      - UH, NO, IT--IT'S--
     IT'S DEFINITELY HIDDEN
     IN ONE OF MY DRAWERS.

            - OKAY.
  - IT'S ON MY SIDE OF THE BED
       WHERE I CAN GET IT
        WHEN I NEED IT.
    - FOR EASY ACCESS, HUH?
    - FOR EASY ACCESS, YEAH.

         - OKAY. JOHN.
 - I'D SAY IT'S ON MY WIFE'S--
  IN ONE OF MY WIFE'S DRAWERS.
   - OKAY. SO DOES THAT MEAN
      SHE WOULD INITIATE?

         - UH, PERHAPS.
            - OKAY.
     WHAT ABOUT YOU, ERIC?
  - UM, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
SOMEWHERE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT,

    UM, BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY
      HAVEN'T PUT IT AWAY.
             - OH!
           [laughter]
          - [laughing]
          - ALL RIGHT.

         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE--
     IF A BUMP ON THE HEAD
        GAVE ME AMNESIA
         AND I COULDN'T
       RECOGNIZE MY WIFE,

       IT WOULD ALL COME
      FLOODING BACK TO ME
     AS SOON AS I HEARD HER
           SAY BLANK.
             JOHN.

            - "RAT."
  - AS SOON AS SHE SAID "RAT."
      - KIND OF A PET NAME
    WE HAVE FOR EACH OTHER,
        SO, UM, I'D SAY

   IF SHE SAID "RAT," I WOULD
   DEFINITELY RECOGNIZE HER.
            - ERIC.
    - I'M GONNA SAY "AVERY."
            - AVERY?
  - HE'S OUR 11-MONTH-OLD SON.

             - OH.
            all: AW.
     - AND I'M SURE AS SOON
     AS SHE SAID HIS NAME,
        EVERYTHING WOULD
        COME RIGHT BACK.

        - OKAY. THOMAS.
      - UM, ODDLY ENOUGH,
      I THINK IT WOULD BE
          IF SHE SAID,
     "DON'T YOU REMEMBER?"

           - [laughs]
   - UM, I DON'T WANT TO SAY
     I HAVE MEMORY ISSUES.
            - YEAH.
     - BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
        A LOT OF STUFF.

 - YEAH. "DON'T YOU REMEMBER?"
       HUSBANDS, THIS IS
      OUR FINAL QUESTION.
   WHEN YOU AND YOUR WIFE ARE
 HAVING TEATIME IN THE BEDROOM,

      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
         YOUR WIFE DOES
       THAT LETS YOU KNOW
  HER KETTLE IS ABOUT TO BOIL?
             ERIC.

     - SHE RUBS HER FINGERS
          UP MY BACK.
            - OKAY.
           - [laughs]
       - AND EVERYTHING'S
  RIGHT OUT THERE IN THE OPEN,

   SO NO WAITING, ALL RIGHT.
         - ABSOLUTELY.
           - THOMAS.
    - UM, SHE LOVES MY HAIR,
     SO SHE'LL GRAB MY HAIR
       REAL TIGHT, YEAH.

 - SO YOU COULD JUST BE SITTING
       THERE WATCHING TV,
 AND ONCE SHE YANKS YOUR HAIR,
            IT'S ON.
           - IT'S ON.
            - OKAY.

           [laughter]
      ALL RIGHT. [laughs]
             JOHN.

      SHE'LL JUST TELL ME.

  - SHE'LL JUST LET YOU KNOW.

OR SOMEWHERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT?

            VALARIE.
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
    WITH ONE OF HIS DRAWERS.

    I THINK WE TRY AND KEEP
       EVERYTHING HIDDEN
    ON HIS SIDE OF THE BED,
        AND HIS DRAWERS
  ARE ON HIS SIDE OF THE BED.
 - WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS?

       - SOME LOVELY TOYS
    WE MAY HAVE BOUGHT OR...
 - WHAT'S SO LOVELY ABOUT 'EM?
           - [laughs]

  - AND REALLY PRETTY COLORS.
        - YEAH, MM-HMM.
   - THOMAS, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
        IN HIS DRAWERS.

          - [laughing]
        - NO, I'M NICE!

          - ALL RIGHT.
  AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, ALISON?
 - I'M GONNA SAY IN MY DRAWER,
  UM, BECAUSE I'M THE ONLY ONE
  WHO HAS A PROPER NIGHTSTAND.
  WE ONLY HAVE ONE NIGHTSTAND.

            - OKAY.
   - I GET IT. I'M THE GIRL.
- SO WHAT--WHAT TYPES OF THINGS
       ARE IN THE DRAWER?
         - UM, PINK...
             - OH.

      - A LITTLE SPARKLES.
   - A LOT OF PINK SPARKLIES
           OVER HERE.

        - I'M GONNA SAY
      ONE OF HIS DRAWERS.
   - ANYTHING IN PARTICULAR?
      - UH, BUNGEE CORDS.

        - BUNGEE CORDS.
           [laughter]
         WHAT DO YOU DO
      WITH A BUNGEE CORD?
- OH, WE GET A LITTLE CREATIVE.

        I GET CREATIVE.
   - A LITTLE CREATIVE, HUH?
           - [laughs]
          - HUH! WOW.
   ERIC, YOU'RE JUST SMILING.
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

  SOMEWHERE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.
            - WHAT?
     - THEY'RE NOT PUT AWAY
           RIGHT NOW.
- YEAH, BUT THEY ARE--NORMALLY,
    THEY'RE IN YOUR DRAWER.

- NO, 'CAUSE SHE SAID RIGHT NOW.
        - NEXT QUESTION,
      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
     IF A BUMP ON THE HEAD
        GAVE ME AMNESIA

         AND I COULDN'T
       RECOGNIZE MY WIFE,
       IT WOULD ALL COME
  FLOODING BACK TO ME AS SOON
   AS I HEARD HER SAY BLANK.
            ALISON.

     - I WOULD PROBABLY SAY
   "CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF,"
   BECAUSE HE LEAVES A TRAIL
   OF HIS THINGS EVERYWHERE,
   AND I'M KIND OF LIKE, "OH,
  PICK THAT UP, PICK THAT UP."

           SO I'D SAY
   "CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF."
    - WHAT'D YOU SAY, JOHN?
             "RAT."
           - [laughs]
      - YOUR NAME FOR HIM.

            - YEAH.
    - WE DO SAY "RAT" A LOT.
- IT'S VERY ENDEARING, ISN'T IT?

           - I KNOW.
            - YEAH.
  IT CERTAINLY GETS ME GOING.
     - [laughs] ALL RIGHT.
     LISA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

  - UM, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
        "ARE YOU PLAYING
       THE GAME TONIGHT?"
   "ARE YOU PLAYING THE GAME
           TONIGHT?"

            - YEAH.
   - SO WHAT'D YOU SAY, ERIC?
            "AVERY."
             - HUH?

- AND IT WOULD ALL COME FLOODING
          BACK TO HIM.
 - OH, THAT'S SWEET BUT WRONG.
    - [laughs] GOOD ANSWER.
           [laughter]

             - OHH.
        'CAUSE AVERY IS
   YOUR 11 MONTH OLD, RIGHT?
         - YES, HE IS.
            - OKAY.

           ALL RIGHT.
  NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU, VALARIE?
        - I'M GONNA SAY
  "THANKS FOR BEING ON TIME."
     IT WAS THE FIRST THING
      HE EVER SAID TO ME.

    UM, WE WERE MEETING, UM,
            FOR, UH,
   THIS AFTER-SCHOOL THING...
           - MM-HMM.
      - AND "AFTER-SCHOOL"

         BEING COLLEGE,
      AND HE--I WAS LATE,
    AND HE LOOKED UP AT ME--
  I'VE NEVER MET HIM BEFORE--
          AND HE SAID,
  "THANKS FOR BEING ON TIME."

           [laughter]
            - SO...
   - THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SAY.
 - [laughs] ALL RIGHT, THOMAS,
        WHAT'D YOU SAY?

       - DO YOU REMEMBER?
    - "DON'T YOU REMEMBER?"
        - OH. WHAT IS--
   - I ALWAYS FORGET THINGS.
             - OH.
- IT'S LIKE AMNESIA, FORGETTING.

   - OH, AMNESIA, FORGETTING.
 OH, OKAY, I GET IT. I GET IT.
   I GET WHERE YOUR MIND WAS.
    I MEAN, IT'S NOT RIGHT,
 BUT I GET WHERE YOUR MIND WAS.

           - [laughs]
       ALL RIGHT, THIS IS
  OUR FINAL QUESTION, LADIES.
 WHEN YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND ARE
 HAVING TEATIME IN THE BEDROOM,

      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
         HE SAID YOU DO
        TO LET HIM KNOW
 YOUR KETTLE IS ABOUT TO BOIL?
             LISA.

    - I GUESS I KIND OF GO,
           "OH! OH."
             - OH.
          - [cheering]
    [laughter and applause]

       - THAT NOISE, HUH?
            - YEAH.
        - AND HE KNOWS.
  ERIC, WHAT ABOUT THAT NOISE?

      YOU RUN YOUR FINGERS
          UP HIS BACK.
          - OH, OKAY.
           EH, OKAY.
           - [laughs]

   - ERIC, THAT'D BE SO COOL.
  CAN YOU MAKE THE SAME SOUND?
 - ACTUALLY, I'M PRETTY SILENT.
    - YOU'RE PRETTY SILENT?
        - UH, I'M JUST--
    I'M JUST GETTING IT ON.

           - [laughs]
   YOU'RE JUST GROOVIN', HUH?
     [cheers and applause]
     - ALL RIGHT, VALARIE.

  - [laughs] I'M USUALLY LIKE,
         "OH, MY GOD."
    I'LL SAY, "OH, MY GOD."
  - THAT'S THE WAY YOU SAY IT?
- YEAH, WELL, NO, I MEAN, THAT'S

   NOT--OKAY, I'LL BE LIKE...
[gasps] "OH, MY GOD," LIKE THAT.
             - OH.
           [laughter]
            - YEAH.
      - THAT'S VERY NICE.

             - YES.
     - WOW, LOOK AT THOMAS.
             YEAH.
    THOMAS, WHAT'D YOU SAY?
      - YOU GRAB MY HAIR.
     - OH! FAIL, YES, I DO

         DO THAT, TOO.
           - [laughs]
 - IT'S ALL IN THE SAME MOTION.
  IT'S AN, "OH, MY GOD," WITH
 THE GRABBING OF THE HAIR, YES.

        - ONE BIG--YEAH.
        - OKAY, CORRECT.
- [laughs] AND WHAT DO YOU SAY,
         THEN, THOMAS?
  "THANKS FOR BEING ON TIME"?
           - [laughs]

           [laughter]
             - YES.
          - [cheering]
          - [laughing]
             WHOO!

           ALL RIGHT.
            ALISON.

     So what I'm saying is,

      When you take GEICO,

 you can call them anytime you
    feel like saving money.

         day or night.
       Use your computer,
        your smartphone,
     your tablet, whatever.

         The point is,
       you have options.
      Oh, how convenient.
        Hey. Crab cakes,

  GEICO. Fifteen minutes could

    THAT CAME INTO OUR YARD.

           - [laughs]
      - IT JUST SAT THERE
    AND LOOKED AT US, SO...
          - ALL RIGHT,
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.

   THE LAST TIME YOUR HUSBAND
          SAID SORRY,
  WAS IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING
       HE DID IN PUBLIC,
        IN THE KITCHEN,
       OR IN THE BEDROOM?

            ALISON.
        - UM, IN PUBLIC.
        - WHAT'D HE DO?
 - HE GOT REALLY, REALLY DRUNK.
        - [chuckles] OH.

             LISA.
     - I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO
      WITH IN THE KITCHEN.
           - MM-HMM.
 - BECAUSE WE JUST HAD A FIGHT,

  AND HE HAS, LIKE, A BIG EGO.
           - UH-HUH.
      - SO HE CAN'T ADMIT
        THAT HE'S WRONG,
    SO HE, LIKE, GETS REALLY
  SILENT AND NASTY SOMETIMES,

    BUT I LOVE HIM ANYWAYS.
            - YEAH.
  - SO I'D SAY IN THE KITCHEN.
   - IN THE KITCHEN. VALARIE.

      A CUTE LITTLE BUTT.
        - OKAY. VALARIE.

        I LOVE HIS HAIR.

     IT'S SO CUTE AND CURLY
   AND JUST CUTE AS A BUTTON.
            - OKAY.
      - CUTE AS A BUTTON.
           - ALISON.
 - I'M GONNA GO WITH HIS EYES.

   I WOULD KILL FOR HIS EYES.
         THEY'RE BLUE.
  HE HAS LONG, GIRLIE LASHES.
           - LASHES.
   - SO THEY'RE PRETTY CUTE.

            - YEAH.

       - OCEAN IN BRAZIL.
            - JOHN.
   - I'LL SAY A SWIMMING HOLE
           IN HAWAII.

      - THAT SOUNDS GOOD.
- YEAH, IT WAS ON OUR HONEYMOON,
  AND WE HAD A LITTLE PRIVACY
   IN A VERY SECLUDED PLACE,
          AND IT WAS--

   THAT COYOTE IN YOUR YARD.
          - [cheering]
            - WHOO!
   ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION.

 THE LAST TIME YOU SAID SORRY,
    DID YOUR WIFE SAY IT WAS
  BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU DID
   IN PUBLIC, IN THE KITCHEN,
       OR IN THE BEDROOM?

             JOHN.
   - I'LL SAY IN THE KITCHEN.
        - WHAT HAPPENED?
  UM, IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
         TO DO WITH ME

 NOT CLEANING UP AFTER MYSELF.
            - OKAY.
       ALISON. IN PUBLIC.
             - OH.
         - YOU REMEMBER
      WHEN YOU GOT DRUNK?

   - I DO. UH, NOT THAT WELL,
   I DON'T REMEMBER IT, BUT--

     - HE DOESN'T REMEMBER.
 HE DOESN'T REMEMBER ANYTHING.
- I'M TOLD ABOUT THAT AFTERNOON
          MORE THAN--
        - WHAT HAPPENED?

   - YOU KNOW, IT WAS JUST--
 I DIDN'T EAT ANY FOOD ALL DAY,
       AND THEN I WENT...
  - ONE BEER TURNED INTO TEN.
            - YEAH.
    - NEXT THING YOU KNOW...

  - I MEAN, YOU KNOW, SHERRI,
    I MEAN, YOU KNOW HOW...

      TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

     - YEAH, YOU WERE JUST
      HAVING A GOOD TIME.
      - YEAH, YOU KNOW...
          - ALL RIGHT.
   NOW WHAT ABOUT YOU, ERIC?
  - I'M GONNA SAY THE KITCHEN,

BECAUSE SHE'S ALWAYS BUGGING ME
       TO DO THE DISHES.
IT'S DEFINITELY NOT THE BEDROOM,
      BECAUSE I NEVER HAVE
     TO BE SORRY FOR THAT.

       - YEAH, YOU'RE NOT
      SAYING YOU'RE SORRY.
       MNH-MNH, NOT YOU.
           - [laughs]
 - ALL RIGHT, SO THAT KITCHEN.
     WHAT'D YOU SAY, LISA?

        IN THE KITCHEN.
         - YEAH. MWAH!

   - THOMAS, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

- UM, IT'S DEFINITELY IN PUBLIC.
   - DOES THIS--THINGS HAPPEN
      IN PUBLIC FREQUENTLY
     WHERE YOU HAVE TO SAY
         YOU'RE SORRY?

     - THEY DON'T--IT'S NOT
  LIKE AN EVENT THAT HAPPENS,
   BUT THINGS SEEM TO UNFOLD
     WHILE WE'RE IN PUBLIC.
           - [laughs]
    WHILE YOU'RE IN PUBLIC.

            - YEAH.
        - OKAY, VALARIE.
  VALARIE SAID IN THE KITCHEN.
             - OH.
  WHAT DO YOU MEAN, IN PUBLIC?

       - IN THE KITCHEN?
  - YOU DON'T REMEMBER THINGS.
 SO WHAT IS THIS THAT HAPPENED
           IN PUBLIC?
     WE'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING
        IN THE KITCHEN.

    AND WE'RE FIGHTING NOW.
  - IT ENDS UP IN THE KITCHEN.
    FROM--FROM THE PUBLIC...
       - FROM THE PUBLIC.
  - IT MOVES INTO THE KITCHEN.

   - INTO THE KITCHEN, OKAY.

  - I'VE GOT MEMORY PROBLEMS.
          - [laughing]
        ALL RIGHT, JOHN,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

 - UM, SHE'S TOLD ME SHE LIKES
      MY EYES IN THE PAST,
 SO I'LL PROBABLY SAY MY EYES.
