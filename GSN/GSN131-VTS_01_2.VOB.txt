      Audrey, I apologize
      for your colleague.
It's nice to have you
back again.
         This is great.

Welcome aboard.
You got a new player,
Shannon Bryan
who is a student of something
over at UCLA.

What do you study?
               I study theater.
Theater?
                          Yeah.
How much longer
do you have to go?
  Well, this is my fourth year,

                     so probably
         like a year and a half.
Oh, yeah? You'll be out on
an unsuspecting world shortly.
                          Yeah.
    Dick, did you ever study
   for whatever it is you do?

       Oh, clearly, yes.
        I studied knots
        for a long time.
      [audience laughing]

     Yeah, that's about it.
You and I have the uniform
of the day on, I didn't realize.
                 Oh, yeah, yeah.
        We could go out
      and sing somewhere.

     I didn't get your note
  asking what am I gonna wear,
    what are you gonna wear.
Sue Staley's with us
from Indiana

and she did very well
yesterday.
How much money
did you win, Sue?
                   I won $10,500
         and a Caribbean cruise.

Very nice.
You know--
     [audience applauding]
 I noticed one thing yesterday.

     I said you're gonna go
 down there and spend six days
    and then Johnny Gilbert
        said seven days.
     Somewhere between six
         and seven days

you're gonna be going
to the Caribbean.
                         Right.
Do you-- Did we ever find out
who is right, John?
                       (Johnny)
                   No, not yet.
Hmm.

              Well, it's seven.
How many?
                         Seven.
Seven days?
           Terrific.

 Through your help, my friend.
       You said it right,
        I said it wrong.

[indistinct chattering]
      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT

   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,
  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.

      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD

TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.

      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,
      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.
   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE

FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,

   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,
    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,

     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.
    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,

AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,
    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE

   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.
  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM

 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.
 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.
   GUYS, I'VE FIGURED IT OUT!

   "THE LAW OF PIZZAPLICITY!"
                  GO ON...?
 YOU CAN GET TWO DIGIORNO PIZZAS

 FOR THE PRICE OF ONE DELIVERY!
              I THINK YOU JUST
               DOUBLED MY IQ.

This has got

I mean,

           Thank you.

        I know. And she's calm.
      That's the amazing thing.
That's the secret.
                          Yeah.
You were talking about it
yesterday, huh?
If you want to win so badly
that you make yourself nervous

whereas if you try to lose,
no you don't.
Try not to think
about it.
                          Yeah.
     I'll show you how to lose.
No. No, no.

Put your heads together.
Let's go for the $10,000.

All of those things--
     [audience applauding]

                         Sorry.

          It is indeed

in the upcoming feature film,
"The Waltz King."
              Yes.

     And that-- You're obviously
     not in the title role.
      No, Johann Strauss,
     I'm not playing that.
  I'm playing his wife, Lily.

Are you-- What kind of a wife
did he have?
    Oh, a very naughty wife.
Oh.
      [audience cheering]

It's alright.
Now why would they look at you
and give you roles like that?
Ho, ho, ho.
        I-I don't know.

 Anyway, when we'll we see it?
     Um, probably in March.
Okay.
We'll look forward
to "The Waltz King."

Dick Cavett, you'll see

        The Singles Bar,

     On A First Name Basis,
          Upsy Daisy.
  And before youick one out,
      I got to ask a woman
     who's going to college
          these days,

          do you know
    what the turkey trot is?
Did you ever hear
that phrase?
                            No.
   Uh, it's the old father time.

Yeah, yeah.
Mr. Cavett and I
know what it is.
          Do you know
    what a running board is?
      [audience laughing]

                    Yeah, yeah.
You don't know what a turkey
trot is either?
    I'm afraid it is a sign
         of the times.
                     Boy. Yeah.
     It was a very popular dance
     in the '20s, ain't it?

     Oh, I thought it was--
                       (Audrey)
            Before the foxtrot.
            I thought it was
         a barnyard stomachache.
        Will you stop?
Which one of these
would you like?

      [audience laughing]
Uh, would you pick a subject

    Describe these things--

     Oh, I didn't tell you
  about the bonus, I'm sorry.
        It's a Mystery 7
and it's a video camera recorder
       worth over $1,800.

   Uh, describe these things
     that give you a lift.
            A lift?
Things that give you a lift.
             Okay.
Ready, go.

Uh, I'm gonna tell a funny...
                           Joke.
                           Clap.

Or the whole audience.
                      Applause.
Uh, bounce
up and down on a...
                 Uh, trampoline.

I'm gonna pay you
a terrific...
                   Sum of money.
I'm gonna pay you a lovely...
             Check. Compliment.

Uh, a Spanish drink,
salt around the rim.
                     Margarita.
Yeah.
Uh, I'm gonna give you
a little...

                            Pat.
And I'm gonna give you
more money.

more than your salary.

                  A raise, uh--
Or more.
For just this week only.
                       A bonus.
(Dick)
That's it.
       Yeah. Is that it?

            Oh, geez.
7 out of 7.
        Seems like fun.
Audrey Landers, please,
your choice is?

         April Showers.
Describe these things
associated with rain.
 Things associated with rain.

 Ready, go.
Okay, you carry
a parasol or...
                   An umbrella.
Uh-hmm.

Okay. Noah had an...
                           Ark.
Okay. And this,
up in the sky--

                     A rainbow.
Uh, no, no.
                        Clouds.
Uh-hmm.
Okay. You step in a...

                        Puddle.
Okay. And one little...
                          Drop.
Uh-hmm.

Okay, and if it's not
soaking wet, it's just
kind of...
                          Damp.
Okay. And if it's not alkaline,
it's...

                     It's acid.
Uh-hmm.
(Dick)
Yes, indeed!
             Whoo!
     [audience applauding]

We got a good game coming.
              Oh.
    Shannon Bryan has the choice
    from the last four.
                The Fine Print.
I didn't hear you.

          Fine Print.
     That's the Mystery 7.
     [audience applauding]
     14 points, Shannon,
     will win you that bonus

     of the video camera
     recorder thing.
Uh, you don't know what it is
until afterwards.
Here's your 30 seconds.
Ready and go.

  Okay, this is what you look at
                   a restaurant.
Menu.
                         Right.
   Um, and this is what you take
   on an exam.

                          Test.
Right.
Um, and--
George Washington
is on the money.
Money, it's the dollar,
a bill.
                         Right.

    Um, and this is what you get
    when you graduate.
Diploma.
         And you sign your name,
         it's your...

Check. A signature.
Autograph.
                         Right.
     Um, this is what the doctor
     gives you for medicine.
Prescription.

               Um, and this is
               what you vote on.
A ballot.
                         Right.
(Dick)
That's it!
     [audience applauding]

                      Thank you.
Shannon just won herself
a portable video camera recorder
 worth over $1,800.

      You were describing
   through all those things,
     things found on paper.
           It's 14-7.

Sue, what would you like?
     We'll try the Turkey Trot.
Alright.
Describe these things
associated with a turkey.
                      Oh, okay.
Things associated
with a turkey.

 Ready, go.
                  The month of--
November.
                        Uh-hmm.

       And this is the meat man.
       The meat--
The butcher.
              And you put this
              inside the turkey.

Stuffing.
                         Right.
        And the noise he makes.
Gobble.
Right. And you put
the sauce on top of a--

Cranberry sauce.
              No, when cooking.
You baste it, baste.
                   Yes, uh-hmm.
      And this is the red sauce.

Cranberry sauce.
                        Uh-hmm.
           And when you cut him.
You slice it.
                            No.

You carve it.
                         Right.
That's it.
Perfect game going.
             Whoo!
21-21 as it gets there
and it's broken by a tie.

 They will have a $5,000 bonus
         for the person
  who breaks the tie at 21-21.
Uh, back we go over here, Dick.

Uh, avoiding the name problem,
         we go with--
Got to hang them with it, eh?
We're gonna take
The Shingles Bar.
Alright, we'll see what
you're giving them on return.

         You're giving.
     Describe these things
        that have bars.
              Oh.
Things that have bars.

 Ready, go.
Uh, not a window but...
                        A door.
Uh-hmm.

You go there to exercise.
                          A gym.
 A fortune...

                         Teller.
Animals in the...
                            Zoo.

Yeah, in the garden
you open the...
                       The gate.
Uh, where the convicts are.

                        Prison.
Or...
The big house.
                          Jail.
The longer word.
          The, um, penitentiary.

Yeah, next.
Yeah.
Uh, a second,
a rank in the army,
a second or a first...
                    Lieutenant.

                  (Dick)
                  That's got it.
     [audience applauding]
You're alright.

   I think they were debating
       about penitentiary
      for a minute or so.
       But you got that.
   This was a big penitentiary.
        You have indeed
      hung your opponents

         with the one
      that nobody wanted.
                          Yeah.
Audrey,
will you give or receive?
                   She'll give.
           I'll give.

 These are people or characters
 who are known by just one name.
             Okay.
People or characters
who are known by just one name.
You need all of them
for a tie.

Ready, go.
Okay. Sonny and...
                           Cher.

Okay. And the frog
of the "Muppet."
                        Kermit.
Uh-hmm.
Okay.
And Anthony and...

                     Cleopatra.
And not a king but, uh...
                         Queen.
Lower, lower.

                      A prince.
Uh-hmm.
Okay. And somebody's travels.
                    Gulliver's.

Okay.
And the one who--
Oh, I don't remember
who this was.
Pass.

You can't pass
'cause you'll lose.
          Okay. Okay.
         Um, not, uh--
        [buzzer sounds]
Oh, I'm so sorry.

Rumplestiltskin was the one
that caught her up.
Shannon and Dick, let's go
to the Winner's Circle

We're back and ready to go.
Uh, a couple of quick things
you should know.

Your opponent has won $800.
That is a high score.
I mean, that is,
that's not an easy one to beat,
so you want to try to barrel
through there and get them all,

end up with $10,000,
and there will be no worries
because you'll be back in here
to play tomorrow.

Concentrate very carefully
on his face.
 He uses his expressions a lot.
He'll give you
a little head nod

if you're
in the right direction.
I caution you, Dick,
'cause the last time
you were beginning
to begin to talk
to your partner.

                      In words?
Yeah, yeah.
Give her a head nod
but don't say right--
            How are you supposed
     to convey another word for?

I don't know.
You can't.
              Nodding, I guess.
'Cause you're strapped in.
                          Yeah.
You give them-- Encourage them
to go along the same line.

Alright.
We're going for $10,000.
Here is your first subject.
Go.

               Rumplestiltskin.
Fairy tale people.
     [audience applauding]

               and be on a ship.

      [audience cheering]
        Oh, my goodness.
    [indistinct chattering]

Help-Help me
with the hen clue
because there was a word
I was looking for
and I can't get it
out of my head.

                           Lay.
A hen that lays
a lot of eggs.
Not prolific,
what's that word?
                   A big layer,
        they say or laying hen.
Yeah, but there's
a word for it.

               No, no, they do.
The farmers call it,
they have another word
like it means
it lays a lot of--
                     A nesting?
         Setting hen.
 A brew-- Yes, there is a word.

I can't find the word.
          It means a good layer
                       of eggs.
      It's a setting hen.
                     A setting?
          This is a word
          my farmer friends use.

Anyway--
        Are there farmers here?
       My dad's a farmer.
We have-we have--
Is there a farmer in the house?
 My dad's a farmer, but I don't
know what you're talking about.

Now did he raise hens?
          Well, yeah.
        Thirty chickens.
                      Prolific.
I-- It was the word I had,
but that's not what they use.

But it means there's a hen
that lays a lot of eggs.
                        Uh-huh.
That'll do it.
Obviously would--
Hey, you won the $10,000.

 We'll be right back.
              Now we can relax.
          Oh, my God.
                You didn't know
               we were through.
       No, I had no idea.

                    You thought
               there were more?
I thought there were a lot more.
    [indistinct chattering]
That would've helped.

 Still working on that.
Yes, sir, you have a question
or a comment?
   I thought of the perfect clue
                   for lay eggs,

        most Broadway musicals.
       [audience laughing]
It wouldn't help.
              No.
                       Alright.
Audrey, we'll see you tomorrow.

We got to run along
on our way.
Sue, you're off to the Caribbean
for as Johnny said seven days
and with $11,300.
             Thank you so much.

             Thank you very much
             for joining.
Dick, we'll see you tomorrow.
Shannon, you'll be back.
             Okay.
You got $11,100
and the video cassette recorder.

 That's worth about $1,800.
And you have yourself
a good time.
       See you tomorrow.
    For now, I'm Dick Clark.
            So long.

             <i>(Johnny)</i>

             <i>this is</i>

             <i>And now,</i>
        <i>here is your host,</i>
           <i>Dick Clark.</i>

      [audience cheering]
      Thank you very much.
   Thank you, Johnny Gilbert.
             It is
      The $25,000 Pyramid

    rolling along once again
          here on CBS.
We're very, very happy as always
      to have you with us.
    I hope you can join in,
         have some fun.

  You'll know all the answers
        as I will, too,
   because it's so easy to--
       You know, when you
  watch you guys do all this,

             I say,
  "What did they say donuts."
        So now, you yell
         at the screen.
                       (Dick C.)
        We were just saying that
    even we've been on the show.

You watch it home and you think,
      "Why are they tense?
     Why are they nervous?"
Well, tell me why?
How does it happen?
It's because when you sit here,
it's really intense.

And then the fact that you
makes us nervous backstage
    by bugging us and you--
      [audience laughing]
      I mean, the fact
      that we get out here

with an electric cattle prod
has nothing to do with anything.
Yeah. When I came out, you said,
you're fly may be open.
      [audience laughing]

      Everybody knows
      it's not true.
      Shannon Brian
      is your partner, Dick.
      We might as well say hello
      while we're over there.

How much money have you won
so far, Shannon?
                        $11,100
   and a video camera recorder.
Yeah.
Camera recorder,
congratulations on that.

        Audrey Landers,
 we welcome you back, my dear.
           Thank you.
You're blazing
in your red outfit.
         Yes, we match.
I see some matching set here.

Did you compare notes
ahead of time, Kelly?
                No, she didn't.
What is your last name?
                        Burton.
What do you do, please?
          I'm a scope operator.

           I, um, receive orders
               from stockbrokers
   and I send them over the wire
           to the stock exchange
         to buy and sell stocks
                     and bonds.
Wow, wow.

          Wow, this is
     certainly a little bit
      of a different world
         for you here.
     I wish you good luck.

One thing
I will note ahead of time,
     You got to have a lot
           of voice.
  I got to be able to hear you
and I am stretching to hear you,

          so make sure
   we hear every note there.
      The Winner's Circle
   is over here, good people.
   We'll talk more about that
          in a while.

    These are the subjects.
   We have Letter Countdown,
        Watch It Weave,
          Tie One On,

           in there.
Audrey,

        A Baker's Dozen.

     Describe these things
        that are baked.
Things that are baked.

Ready, and go.
Okay, not a pie but...
                        A cake.
Uh-hmm.

Okay, and hen is a...
                       Chicken.
Okay, and a blank a day

                   Apple a day.
Uh-hmm.
Okay, and, uh,
blank Lorraine.
                        Quiche.

Okay, and you build
a house with these red...
                        Bricks.
Uh-hmm.
Okay, and they come in brown
or English...

                        Muffin.
Okay, and you've put
a whole lot of stuff--
You stick it in the oven
and you put--
                     Casserole.

            Uh-hmm.
Yes, indeed.
That's a seven-pointer.
              Thank you so much.
Casserole. Wow!

   How did you get that from
  when you put a lot of stuff
         and you stick
         in the oven?
     I make a lot of casserole.
     7 out of 7.
     Dick, what would like?

     We love Letter Countdown
     for some reason.
  Well, that's your problem.
                       Come on!
       You are to describe
       these seven-letter words.

Seven-letter words.
          Oh, my God.
  No, we don't want that then.
No, too late now.
You put your foot in it.
Ready and go!

It tells you the direction.

Are you okay?
Audrey and Kelly, the rules
of the game are so evident.

Everybody now I had said
to repeat them.
But every now and again,
somebody watches as well.
Well, how does it work?
They have 60 seconds.

There are six subjects
up behind your partner's head.
 You are to give only a list.
 Use very few adjectives.

One maybe you can get away
with it.
But if you get thrown
a lot of words,
they're gonna give you
a zap for sure.

 Please do not use your hands
and if you have difficulty
with one,
you can always leave it behind
and return to it,

provided the time
hasn't run out.

here is your
first subject.

            and he really wanted
                    to go there.

                         or a...

Gun. Revolver.
                         Right.
        This is a big armored...
Truck. Tank.

      This is what Goliath slew.
Slingshot.
Sling.
                          Yeah.
           Um, this is
           what you throw at a--

A javelin.
                            No.
A dart.
   It's what the natives throw.
A spear.
                         Right.

(David Clark)
That's it.
                     Thank you.
We're on a hot roll
over there, 14-11.
       Hey, it's alright.

  Shannon, with the situation
             14-11,
you want to come up with another
   so easy to breeze, do it,
you leave them
with a tough one.

I don't know which is which,
do you?
        Let's try Maid to Order.
Would you like to give
or receive?
                       Receive.

 Audrey, describe these things
   associated with the maid.
Things associated with the maid.
Ready, go!

Okay, she sweeps,
she does, she...
                    She cleans.
Uh-hmm.
Okay, and she wears
around her waist.

                         Apron.
Okay, and you give her
a gratuity, a...
                           Tip.
Uh-hmm.

Okay, and she does it
to the floor.
                           Mop.
Yeah.
Okay, and you go
to the supermarket, you go...

                      Shopping.
Uh-hmm.
Okay, and if you're very tidy,
you are very...
                          Neat.

Okay. And if you have
a big house--
Oh, you're dealing real--
                        Estate.
Uh-hmm.

(Dick Clark)
Okay.
     [audience applauding]
 18-14.

    Shannon, let me ask you
    why you picked that one
    versus Designing Women?
           'Cause it looked like
                a name category.
