      on the other side?
                       He will.
Dick?
       It doesn't matter.

Describe these women
in television.
       I don't know any.
          Oh, that's
     my weakest category.
Women in television.

  Yeah, we-we refuse to play.

                     That's it.
 I don't think you will-- No.

            Uh-huh.

 If you, uh, win the money,
we get Ryan up here

Concentrate on--
If we get something like things
           that are incidental,
        we're just gonna leave.
   We're just gonna walk out
            and go.
            Don't say that,
            it's live.

            For $25,000,

Um, things you dock.

Things you, um--
                    Temptation.
        [buzzer sounds]

        Temptation is the word.
      What is the one
      that goes with temptation?
        What do you try to do
        with temptation?

   You try to, um, avoid it.
There's a word
that goes with it.
          You try to--

There's a word that's tied
right to temptations.
A perfect clue he gave you.
They always say, no, no, no.

Oh, you must try
to, um, temptation.
               Oscar Wilde said,
           "I can blank anything
            except temptation."

Turn-turn around take a look.
      I don't want to look.
Turn--turn this way,
so we could see that wonderful
expression on your face.
              Oh!

Thank you very much.
Dick, we'll see you tomorrow.
        Yeah, I hope so.
Yeah, you know.
       I'm invited back?

Absolutely.
             Okay.
Kelly, you're at the $2,350,

              Hey.
You have a parting word?
       Can I make a card
  with a clue on it tomorrow

  and I shall show it to you,
 and I'll bet you can't get it.
This is like
"The Perils of Pauline."
       Tomorrow, tune in.

   And I personally will get
     the clue for that card

             Okay.

And, Audrey, are you ready
to go into battle?
        Oh, I'm ready.
        I don't know
        if I can take it but...
It's been a really good week,
tough games back and forth.

               It's been great.
Kevin Rose,
you've been watching and I'm--
We're happy to have you here.
                     Thank you.
        What do you do
        when you're not with us?

        Uh, well, I'm originally
          from Southern Illinois
          and I'm a travel agent
                      now in LA.
  Nice to have you here, sir.

    We hope you'll travel to
the Winner's Circle in a while.
     Now we have to settle
      a little something.
We left the viewers yesterday
with a bit of a challenge.

Apparently there was something
on yesterday's program
that irked, Mr Cavett.
           Oh, well.
   It's a category called
   "Things That Are Outrageous."

                           Yeah.
      For which there are
      innumerable clues.
   Any fool would know this.
            Yeah, it's a little
               abstract though.
No, it's tough
but not impossible.
             Okay.

    Now you alleged to have come
    up with a category
    for which I will not be able
    to come up with a clue.
          Right, yeah.
       I wanna get even.

     It's like the example from
    the one you got right here.
     Where are you going?
                  I'm just gonna
                 show it to you.
      Oh, you don't want
    the audience to see it?
I wanted to see your face.

Okay, there are
eight seconds to go,
we're at the top of the Pyramid
and you get this clue.
Go! Yeah!

              That's so obvious.
           [laughter]
                Now, turn around
 slowly and show them what you--

         What are you talking...
Give a try, come on.
You've only got six seconds!
Uh, I, the world.
Uh, God, air.
Things, uh...

                    Turn around.
      [audience cheering]
      [audience applause]

Do you rest your case?
Is that it?
        I rest my case.
          Yeah, that--
         Ooh, you said,
        it's so obvious.

               Did you see that?
                        (Kelly)
              Yeah, I saw that.
       He tried to read it loud.
         That's cute.
       My favorite is things
       that are not your troops.

    Try to figure that out.
      [audience laughing]
        That's alright.
Kelly Burton, how much money
have you won so far with us?
                          $2,350
        and a trip to Australia.

You're not even thinking
about the money,
you're going on that trip.
      [audience cheering]
  Continued good luck to you.
 Kevin, good luck to you, sir.
                     Thank you.

        Winner's Circle,
      I mentioned before.
    We'll get you over there
          before long.
 These are the subjects today.

Dick, which one

   we think it's the big one.

          No, it's not
      but these are things
 associated with an architect.

  of a better clue afterwards.
     [audience applauding]

     You got a better one?
    Yeah, when you're about
 to have a baby you go into...
                     Into labor.
Labor, yeah.

 Ready, go.
You go there, there are rides
and it's fancy place.
     Amusement park. A carnival.

Mickey Mouse is there.
       Disney World, Disneyland.
Oh, you drop a penny

 HOW MANY ROUNDS OF CONSTIPATION
 DO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH...

      BEFORE YOU DO
      SOMETHING DIFFERENT?
   WHEN YOU FEEL YOUR
   FIRST SIGNS, TRY MIRALAX.
  UNLIKE OTHER

 MIRALAX EMPOWERS

      WHEN I FOUND OUT MY
      IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT

   PUT ME AT 5 TIMES
   GREATER RISK OF A STROKE,
  MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE ABOUT
  MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY.
 I HAVE THE MOST COMMON TYPE OF
 ATRIAL FIBRILLATION, OR AFIB.

      IT'S NOT CAUSED BY A
      HEART VALVE PROBLEM.
     I WAS TAKING WARFARIN,
BUT MY DOCTOR
PUT ME ON PRADAXA
INSTEAD

TO REDUCE MY
RISK OF STROKE.
IN A CLINICAL TRIAL, PRADAXA®
(DABIGATRAN ETEXILATE MESYLATE)
    REDUCED STROKE RISK 35%
    BETTER THAN WARFARIN.

      AND UNLIKE WARFARIN,
      WITH PRADAXA,
      THERE'S NO NEED FOR
      REGULAR BLOOD TESTS.
 THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME.

   PRADAXA CAN CAUSE SERIOUS,
   SOMETIMES FATAL, BLEEDING.
   DON'T TAKE PRADAXA IF YOU
   HAVE ABNORMAL BLEEDING
AND SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE

FOR UNEXPECTED SIGNS OF
BLEEDING, LIKE UNUSUAL BRUISING.
      PRADAXA MAY INCREASE
      YOUR BLEEDING RISK
     IF YOU'RE 75 OR OLDER,

   HAVE A BLEEDING CONDITION
   LIKE STOMACH ULCERS,
    OR TAKE ASPIRIN, NSAIDS,
    OR BLOOD THINNERS,
OR IF YOU HAVE KIDNEY PROBLEMS,

     ESPECIALLY IF YOU TAKE
     CERTAIN MEDICINES.
    TELL YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT
    ALL MEDICINES YOU TAKE,
     ANY PLANNED MEDICAL
     OR DENTAL PROCEDURES,

AND DON'T STOP TAKING PRADAXA
WITHOUT YOUR DOCTOR'S APPROVAL,
    AS STOPPING MAY INCREASE
    YOUR STROKE RISK.
  OTHER SIDE EFFECTS INCLUDE

   INDIGESTION, STOMACH PAIN,
   UPSET, OR BURNING.
  PRADAXA IS
  PROGRESS.
HAVING AFIB NOT
CAUSED BY A HEART
VALVE PROBLEM

 INCREASES YOUR
 RISK OF STROKE.
 ASK YOUR DOCTOR IF YOU CAN
 REDUCE YOUR RISK WITH PRADAXA.

            Wagnerian costumes.
     [audience applauding]
I'm gonna break into your house
          and steal your stuff.
What a burglar would say.

[audience applauding]
                         A car.
Things you drive.
Things with
a steering wheel.
                 A summer house.

Things you stay--
Things you sit in.
                   Monthly car.
Things you make payments on.
Things you...
                       Pass it.
Next.

          The cannibal's victim.
Things that you've eat?
                   The chicken.
Things that have meat on them.
Things that have bones.
                       Chicken.

Things...
Porcelain.

        the stewing vegetables.
Things in a pot.
                     Yeah, yeah.

     [audience applauding]
                     Messy hair.
Things that are rough?
               Seaweed. Seaweed.

            Monthly apartments.
 Things you make payments on.
   Things you pay rents on.

                           Rent.
                   He said rent.
He did.
 I'm sorry I was overstretching
                   this on you.
Dick, what is it?
You're a very literate person.

What is it something that,
the web that's...
          Oh, what a tangled web
             we weave when first
        we practice to deceive.
Who wrote that?

It's not Shakespeare.
I think it might be Marlowe.
There'd be no way to get it
then if you couldn't say
it's Shakespeare's web
or somebody's web

'cause it wouldn't have
rung itself.
            Right.
                It might be from
   "The Jew of Malta" by Marlowe
                but it may not.
Whatever you say.

             Right.
Gentlemen,
you picked up $350.
That is not enough
to hang in there

but it's certainly
better than a total loss.
             True.
We'll be back
right after this.
            Where is that thing?

     [audience applauding]
           Someone asked me that
                      last week.

Kevin, you're gonna leave us
with a little more than that
which you received
in the Winner's Circle.
            Uh-hmm.
        You've got a bonus money
        worth $1,450.

Thank you, sir.
                     Thank you.
             Kevin, is torturing
             himself now.
 Yeah, I'm trying to think of a
double-stomper for you tomorrow.

Okay.
Tune in tomorrow and see.
Kelly, you're up to $12,350,
your trip to Australia.
Congratulations.
                     Thank you.

  We'll meet you again tomorrow.
And, Audrey,
you'll be back certainly.
             Yes.

PUT YOUR HUSBAND ON A PEDESTAL.
      BUT LET'S SAY HE WAS
    ACTUALLY STANDING ON ONE
           RIGHT NEXT

            STACEY?
    - I THINK I WOULD SAY...

          HIS MUSCLES.

   HE WAS A LITTLE BIGGER...
            AROUND.
       MY HUSBAND'S FEET
        ARE MUCH BIGGER.

          - OH, OKAY.
         THERE YOU GO.
     HOLLY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - UM, I WOULD DEFINITELY
         SAY HIS BELLY.

  - IS MUCH SMALLER COMPARED--
          - SIX-PACK.
         - AH, SIX-PACK
        ON YOUR HUSBAND.

             - YES.

  DID HE JUST HANG ALL OVER--
          - HE JUST...
       COLLEGE BEER GUT.

   OOH, GOOD YOU LET THAT GO.

          JUST BIGGER?
      - WELL, MY HUSBAND'S
         FEET AND BELLY

   ARE JUST BOTH QUITE LARGE.

  IF YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND ARE
 IN AN UNCOMFORTABLE SITUATION,
    WHO GETS MORE FLUSTERED?

             HOLLY.
             - HIM.
   - HE GETS MORE FLUSTERED?
         - DEFINITELY.
             - WHY?

    - LIKE, I'M A PERFORMER,
  SO I'M USED TO BEING ONSTAGE
       AND BEING AWKWARD
    AND IN FRONT OF PEOPLE.
       - AND IN DIFFERENT
        SITUATIONS, HUH?

        - AND HE'S JUST
     A LITTLE LIKE, "EEH!"
             BUT...
           [laughter]
    - MARNE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - MY HUSBAND IS.
    I'M MUCH MORE LAID-BACK.
   - HE GETS MORE FLUSTERED.
       - YES, ABSOLUTELY.
           - STACEY.

         - I THINK I...
         I THINK I GET
        MORE FLUSTERED.
   - YOU GET MORE FLUSTERED?

     - HE JUST SHUTS DOWN.
            - OKAY.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
  TYPICALLY, WHEN DO THE BILLS
    GET PAID IN YOUR HOUSE--

    AS SOON AS THEY ARRIVE,
   RIGHT BEFORE THEY'RE DUE,
   OR RIGHT BEFORE THE LIGHTS
         GET SHUT OFF?

           [laughter]
             MARNE.
            - UM...

   RIGHT BEFORE THEY'RE DUE.
  - RIGHT BEFORE THEY'RE DUE?
             - YES.
     - WHO PAYS THE BILLS?

         - MATT PAYS...
         MOST OF THEM.
          AND I PAY...

          ONE OF THEM.
           [laughter]
   - THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT
          RATIO TO ME.

        - IT IS PERFECT.
        - BUT IT'S RIGHT
      BEFORE THEY'RE DUE.
             - YES.
            - OKAY.

    STACEY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - I HAVE TO SAY
   RIGHT BEFORE THEY'RE DUE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             HOLLY.

  - RIGHT BEFORE THEY'RE DUE.
    - YEAH, MATT'S GOT HIS,
      LIKE, WHOLE BUDGET.
         AND EVERYTHING
       IS VERY ORGANIZED.

   - ALL RIGHT, NOW, LADIES,
  THIS IS OUR BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

         "IF MY HUSBAND
        WAS A MAGICIAN,
  "HE WOULD USE HIS MAGIC WAND
    TO MAKE MY BLANK SMALLER
     AND MY BLANK LARGER."

            STACEY.
       - MAYBE MY HEIGHT.
        CAN I SAY THAT?
    MY HEIGHT--HE'D LIKE ME
    A LITTLE SMALLER, MAYBE.

            - OKAY.
     - AND THEN DEFINITELY
        MY BOOBS BIGGER.
         - HE'D LIKE--
  IS YOUR HUSBAND A BOOB MAN?

       - HE IS DEFINITELY
          A BOOB MAN.
    - HOLLY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - MAYBE MY, LIKE,
 CONTROL "FREAKEDNESS" SMALLER.

     AND HE WOULD PROBABLY
        WANT TO MAKE...
          MAYBE MY...
          CONFIDENCE.

      - HE'D WANT TO MAKE
    YOUR CONFIDENCE BIGGER?
            - YEAH.
            - OKAY.
 - SO ARE YOU A CONTROL FREAK?

             YEAH?
           ALL RIGHT.
     MARNE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - HE WANTS TO MAKE
        MY MESS SMALLER.

      - YOUR MESS SMALLER?
           - MY MESS.
          - HE'D LIKE
     TO MAKE THAT SMALLER?
        - YES. LARGER...

 I'M JUST GONNA GO WITH BOOBS.
          HE'S A MAN.
      - WHAT DO YOU THINK
 HE'S THINKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW?
      - PROBABLY MY BOOBS.

     - PROBABLY YOUR BOOBS?
         - HE'S A MAN.
     - ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU
        SO MUCH, LADIES.
      NOW, WHEN WE RETURN,
        WE'RE GONNA SEE

  IF THEIR HUSBANDS CAN MATCH
         THEIR ANSWERS.

   TO HER LAST EX-BOYFRIEND.

    WHICH OF YOUR BODY PARTS

      COMPARED TO HER EX--
         YOUR MUSCLES,

          YOUR BELLY,

    - MATT, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

          - MY BELLY.

         THAN THE EX'S?
  ALL RIGHT, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

            - YEAH!
     [cheers and applause]

           - MATTHEW,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - I'M GONNA GO WITH MUSCLES.
         - YOUR MUSCLES
       WOULD BE SMALLER?

    - WOULD BE SMALLER, YES.
     - WAS HE A BIGGER GUY?
      - WELL, I'VE JUST...
          I THINK LESS
      ABOUT HIS BEING BIG.

 MINE ABOUT, YOU KNOW, KIND OF
   BEING A LITTLE BIT SMALL.
 - OKAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY, MARNE?
         YOUR MUSCLES.

     [cheers and applause]
             OKAY.
       - NICE JOB, HONEY.

           GENTLEMEN,
    ACCORDING TO YOUR WIFE,

           - REALLY?
      WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

       - SHE TENDS TO...

           - OH, NO.
    - OR WHEN THEY COME IN.

   - WELL, I MEAN, I LIKE TO.
          HOW'S THAT?
           [laughter]
     IS THAT THE QUESTION?

          "I LIKE TO,"
   OR WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENS?
          I-I LIKE TO.
           [laughter]
       ALL RIGHT, I KNOW.

         "IF MY HUSBAND
        WAS A MAGICIAN,

  "HE WOULD USE HIS MAGIC WAND
    TO MAKE MY BLANK SMALLER
     AND MY BLANK LARGER."
              TOM.

- I-I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER.
  I DON'T REALLY, YOU KNOW...
           all: AW...
        BUT IF I HAD TO,

     LIKE, IF YOU PUT A GUN
         TO MY HEAD...
           [laughter]
AND WE HAD TO MAKE SOMETHING...
         DIFFERENT, UM,

         THE LARGER...
      I GUESS IT WOULD BE
          THE BOSOMS.
         - HER BOSOMS?
       - WOULD BE LARGER.

   - BUT THEY'RE PERFECT NOW.
     - THEY'RE PERFECT NOW.
       BUT IF YOU HAD TO.
    - BUT IF I HAD TO, YEAH.

 - YOU'D SAY HER BOSOMS LARGER.
          AND THEN...
          - SMALLER...
        UM, I HAVE TO...

          THE THIGHS?
         I DON'T KNOW.
         I MEAN, LIKE,
    THEY'RE PRETTY PERFECT.
      - BUT WE UNDERSTAND.
         YOU LOVE HER.

    - I DO--NO, NO, I MEAN--
        - YOU LOVE HER.
     - THEY'RE PER--I MEAN,
      I HEAR HER COMPLAIN,
          'CAUSE SHE'S
       VERY PERFECTIONIST

      AND SHE ALWAYS WANTS
          TO WORK OUT.
         IS THAT GOOD?
       - I GOT YA, YEAH.

           [laughter]
  I THINK--I THINK YOU DODGED
    THE BULLET SUCCESSFULLY.
    - YOU GOT SECURITY HERE?
   I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE.

         NOW LET'S SEE
       WHAT STACEY SAID.
         YOU DID GOOD.
  SHE SAID HER HEIGHT SMALLER,
       HER BOOBS LARGER.

          SO YOU GOT--
      YOU GOT HALF RIGHT.
     [cheers and applause]

     MATT, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I THINK SHE WOULD MAKE
       HER TUMMY SMALLER,
    OR HER STOMACH SMALLER,

     AND SHE'D MAKE HER...
             UM...
         BICEPS BIGGER.
        HER ARMS BIGGER,
          MORE TONED.

       - HER ARMS BIGGER,
           ALL RIGHT,
    WHAT DID YOU SAY, HOLLY?
   HER CONTROL "FREAKEDNESS"
            SMALLER

   AND HER CONFIDENCE LARGER.
             - OHH.
           [laughter]

        HOLD ON, YOU'RE
 ON YOUR WAY TO MEXICO, BUT...
   I'D LIKE TO KNOW, MATTHEW,
   WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE SAID?
      - ALL RIGHT, I THINK
   MY WIFE'S BODY IS PERFECT.

     BUT THIS IS JUST BASED
     ON FEEDBACK FROM HER.
            I THINK
     MAYBE SMALLER WE'D...
         I'D GO WITH--
          WITH THIGHS,

           AND WITH--
          - ALL RIGHT.
      - WITH LARGER, I'D--
      I'D GO WITH HEIGHT.
   - LARGER, GO WITH HEIGHT.
             OKAY.

    MARNE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
   - 'CAUSE THE QUESTION WAS
WHAT YOU WOULD MAKE BIGGER OR--
    - YOU WOULD MAKE, UH...

      - SO YOU WOULD MAKE
        MY MESS SMALLER.
            - OHH...
    - AND BIGGER HER BOOBS.

       COUPLE NUMBER TWO,

       HE'S SO MESMERIZED
        BY HER BACKSIDE
         HE CAN'T EVEN

      BACK TO YOU, SHERRI.

          - ALL RIGHT,
    WELL, WELCOME, COUPLES.
           GOOD LUCK
      TO ALL OF YOU GUYS.
   AND YOU BEAUTIFUL LADIES,

     I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK
THAT YOU STAND UP, GO BACKSTAGE,
  BECAUSE WE HAVE TO ASK YOUR
   HUSBANDS A FEW QUESTIONS.
     ALL RIGHT, GUYS, I AM
 GONNA ASK YOU THREE QUESTIONS

         AND IT'S GONNA
      BE UP TO YOUR WIVES
     TO MATCH YOUR ANSWERS.
THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST POINTS

            WILL WIN
 A FANTASTIC SECOND HONEYMOON.
        YOU GUYS READY?
           all: YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.

         ARE PERFORMING
     YOUR FAVORITE MILITARY

   DANNY, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
          - I'M GONNA
       SAY STRAIGHT OUT.

      - OKAY, WE GOT YOU.
    AMITABH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
     - IT PRETTY MUCH DOES
         WHAT IT WANTS.

     IT GOES STRAIGHT OUT.
            - YEAH?
     - I CAN'T CONTROL IT.
            - OKAY.
     MIKE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - JUST LIKE MY TEQUILA,
          STRAIGHT UP.
             - OH!
          - [chuckles]
            - OKAY.

         NOW GENTLEMEN,
         NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
       MY WIFE IS USUALLY
 LIKE THE FRIENDLY DR. JEKYLL,

          BUT WHENEVER
       I FORGET TO BLANK
         SHE TRANSFORMS
    INTO THE EVIL MR. HYDE.
   AMITABH, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

           - MY WIFE
     CAN GET PRETTY ANGRY.
        BUT IT'S USUALLY
    AFTER I DO SIMPLE THINGS
       LIKE NOT CLEAN UP
         AFTER MYSELF.

          - ALL RIGHT.
   MIKE, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
      - UH, IT'S PROBABLY
    NOT PUTTING THE CLOTHES
         IN THE HAMPER.

           BECAUSE...
   THE HAMPER'S RIGHT THERE,
         AND MY CLOTHES
        ARE RIGHT THERE.
        AND I JUST CAN'T
 SEEM TO PUT ONE IN THE OTHER.

    AND SHE GETS ON MY CASE
   THE ENTIRE TIME ABOUT IT.
  - BUT IF IT'S RIGHT THERE--
           - I KNOW.
       - AND YOUR CLOTHES
        ARE RIGHT THERE,

       IT'S JUST A MATTER
        OF A LITTLE SHOT
        INTO THE HAMPER.
      - I'M WORKING ON IT.
       I'M WORKING ON IT.
          - ALL RIGHT.

     DANNY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - SHE REALLY TURNS
         INTO MR. HYDE
    WHEN I DON'T FIGHT BACK.

       - SO WHY DON'T YOU
          FIGHT BACK?
           - BECAUSE
       IT GETS HER ANGRY.
           IT'S FUN.
         I DON'T KNOW.

            - OKAY.
          THIS IS OUR
   FINAL QUESTION, GENTLEMEN
     IF YOU GAVE YOUR WIFE
   FLOWERS FOR HER BIRTHDAY,

             WOULD
       SHE BE OVERJOYED,
             HAPPY
     BUT HOPE THERE'S MORE,
      OR WOULD SHE WONDER
   WHY YOU WASTED YOUR MONEY?

             MIKE?
          - OVERJOYED.
     OVERJOYED BECAUSE IT'S
THE ONE THING SHE ALWAYS WANTS,
     AND IT'S THE ONE THING

          I JUST KEEP
    FORGETTING TO GIVE HER.
          - ALL RIGHT.
             DANNY?
       - SHE'S JUST HAPPY
  WITH THE SIMPLE THINGS, SO.

     DEFINITELY OVERJOYED.
        - SO OVERJOYED.
            - YEAH.
           - AND WHAT
      ABOUT YOU, AMITABH?

      - SHE'D BE HAPPY BUT
 SHE'D DEFINITELY EXPECT MORE.
            THERE'S
     NO TWO WAYS ABOUT IT.
   - ALL RIGHT, THERE WE GO.

           GENTLEMEN,
       THANK YOU SO MUCH.
    NOW WHILE WE'RE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,
    GARY, YOU GOTTA TELL US
  ABOUT THAT SECOND HONEYMOON

   THAT THEY'RE PLAYING FOR.
      - TONIGHT'S WINNERS
        ARE GOING TO THE
 OMNI CANCUN HOTEL AND VILLAS.

    IN THE HEART OF CANCUN,
  MEXICO'S FABLED HOTEL ZONE,
      IS THE IDEAL RESORT
       FOR TRUE ROMANCE.
          OVERLOOKING
   THE STUNNING CARIBBEAN SEA

      AND OFFERING GENUINE
MEXICAN HOSPITALITY AND FLAVOR,
  YOU WILL BE FOREVER IN LOVE
       AT THE OMNI CANCUN
       HOTEL AND VILLAS.

     [cheers and applause]
       - AH, TRUE ROMANCE
         IS IN CANCUN.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,

     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.
      EACH CORRECT ANSWER
     EARNS YOU FIVE POINTS,

         SO HERE WE GO.
           LADIES...
   WHEN YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
      ARE PERFORMING YOUR
  FAVORITE MILITARY MANEUVER,

           DID HE SAY
  HIS LITTLE SOLDIER IS AIMING
   STRAIGHT UP, STRAIGHT OUT,
       OR STRAIGHT DOWN?
             SANDY?

           - I'D HAVE
      TO SAY STRAIGHT OUT.
             - WHY?
         - OH, BECAUSE
    THAT'S WHERE IT'S GOING.

  IT'S AIMING FOR THE TARGET.
          - [laughing]
             OKAY.
    DANNY, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

         STRAIGHT OUT.
        - STRAIGHT OUT.
          both: WHOO.
             - PSH!
          - [giggles]

             OKAY.
     RUCHI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I WOULD SAY STRAIGHT OUT

   BECAUSE...THE SAME REASON.
       HE PROBABLY WANTS
    TO GET RIGHT DOWN TO IT.
          - ALL RIGHT,
   WHAT DID YOU SAY, AMITABH?

     - I SAID STRAIGHT OUT.
    - HE SAID STRAIGHT OUT.
      - SORRY ABOUT THAT.
     - ALL RIGHT, JOHANNA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

    - I'M GONNA BE A LITTLE
 DIFFERENT AND SAY STRAIGHT UP.
         - STRAIGHT UP.
     - JUST LIKE A MARTINI.
             - OH!

          - [giggles]
  - YOU COMPARE IT TO A DRINK.
     - HE'S SWEET THAT WAY.

             - OH!
           ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      HE SAID STRAIGHT UP.

            - NICE.
             MWAH!
   JOHANNA, YOU SAID MARTINI.
      HE SAID STRAIGHT UP
        LIKE A TEQUILA.

       WHAT IS THIS WITH
THE LITTLE SOLDIER AND DRINKING?
           - TENDS TO
     HAPPEN WHEN YOU DRINK.
            - OKAY.
   ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION.

  LADIES, HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       MY WIFE IS USUALLY
 LIKE THE FRIENDLY DR. JEKYLL,
 BUT WHENEVER I FORGET TO BLANK

         SHE TRANSFORMS
    INTO THE EVIL MR. HYDE.
             RUCHI?
     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
   CLEANING UP AFTER HIMSELF.

      THAT'S THE ONLY TIME
     I GET REALLY ANNOYED.
           - REALLY?
  WHAT IS--WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?
       - HE JUST LIKES--
         WELL, HE'S A--

    YOU KNOW, HE'S A DOCTOR,
       AND HE GETS TIRED.
        SO I UNDERSTAND
    THAT HE HAS A LONG DAY,
        BUT I'D LIKE HIM
TO CLEAN UP MORE AFTER HIMSELF.

  - WHAT DO YOU SAY, AMITABH?
  both: CLEAN UP AFTER MYSELF.
   - YOU KNOW ME WELL, BABE.
            - YEAH.

          - [giggles]
             - YES.
   JOHANNA, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
   - I'D HAVE TO SAY LEAVING
   HIS CLOTHES ON THE FLOOR.

      HE DOESN'T PICK UP--
    - HE LEAVES HIS CLOTHES
       ON THE FLOOR TOO?
      WHERE'S THE HAMPER?
     - ONE FOOT TO THE LEFT
      OF WHERE HE LEFT IT.

      - CAN HE NOT SEE IT?
          - MAYBE NOT.
       - OH, MY GOODNESS.
        ALL RIGHT, MIKE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - THERE YOU GO.
- PUT MY CLOTHES IN THE HAMPER.
            - NICE.
           EXCELLENT.
             MWAH.

            - OKAY.
     SANDY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
         - I WOULD HAVE
   TO SAY DOESN'T FIGHT BACK.

     BECAUSE IT COMPLETELY
 TAKES THE WIND OUT OF MY SAILS
WHEN I'M ANGRY ABOUT SOMETHING,
   AND HE JUST DOESN'T REACT.
    - DO YOU THINK HE ENJOYS
      YOU JUST DOING THAT?

       - YEAH, PROBABLY.
         I DON'T KNOW.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
  - WHEN YOU DON'T FIGHT BACK.
         - FIGHT BACK.

             - AH!
       - OH, MY GOODNESS.
         THIS IS GREAT.
    LADIES, IF YOUR HUSBAND
        GAVE YOU FLOWERS

       FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,
    DID HE SAY YOU WOULD BE
           OVERJOYED,
  HAPPY BUT HOPE THERE'S MORE,
      OR WOULD YOU WONDER
    WHY HE WASTED HIS MONEY?

            JOHANNA.
             - MM.
           HAPPY BUT
       HOPE THERE'S MORE.
           - REALLY?
    - YEAH, I LIKE FLOWERS,

     BUT I LIKE OTHER STUFF
       MORE THAN FLOWERS.
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       HE SAID OVERJOYED.

             - MM.
          - OVERJOYED.
          - [chuckles]
         - THAT'S OKAY.
           ALL RIGHT,
     SANDY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - I WOULD SAY HAPPY
    BUT HOPE THERE WAS MORE.
           - REALLY?
     - I ALSO LOVE FLOWERS,
    BUT I LIKE PRESENTS TOO.
         - OH, YOU LIKE

       THE PRESENTS TOO.
            - YEAH.
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?
            - [sigh]
          - OVERJOYED.

      - OVERJOYED...FAIL.
          - [giggles]
          - ALL RIGHT,
    RUCHI, IT'S DOWN TO YOU.

        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
          - I HONESTLY
      WOULD BE OVERJOYED.
    BECAUSE I THINK, I HOPE
 HE KNOWS THAT I LOVE FLOWERS.

    AND I ALWAYS HINT AT IT,
      SO THAT'S MY ANSWER.
            - OKAY.
    WHAT'D YOU SAY, AMITABH?
  HAPPY BUT HOPE THERE'S MORE.
             - AH.

       - IT'S THE TRUTH.
     IT'S THE TRUTH, BABE.
      WOULD YOU BE HAPPY?
            - SORRY.
   - OKAY, WHERE DO WE STAND?

   COUPLE NUMBER ONE, COUPLE
NUMBER TWO, COUPLE NUMBER THREE,
      YOU ARE ALL TIED FOR
  FIRST PLACE WITH TEN POINTS.
       WHEN WE COME BACK

      The word
  is swapportunity.
                 Can I have
               the definition?

      TO <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME.</i>
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
       IT IS TIME FOR YOU
   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.

        THESE NEXT THREE
   ARE WORTH TEN POINTS EACH.
       THEY SAY THAT TIME
STANDS STILL WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE
     BUT WHEN YOUR HUSBAND
      POPPED THE QUESTION,

          HOW DID YOU
      REACT TO HIS TIMING?
     "FINALLY," "ALREADY,"
    OR "RIGHT ON SCHEDULE?"
             SANDY.
      - RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

   - SO IT WAS RIGHT ON TIME?
        - RIGHT ON TIME.
            - OKAY.
 - IN FRONT OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.
       - OH, REA--WHAT--
      HOW DID HE PROPOSE?

   - IN FRONT OF 1,000 PEOPLE
AT--WE WERE IN A SHOW TOGETHER.
           AND HE WAS
     THE LEAD IN THE SHOW.
  AND AFTERWARD, HE PROPOSED.
             - AWW.

        - SO HE STOPPED
      THE WHOLE ORCHESTRA
  AND PROPOSED RIGHT ON STAGE.
         - WELL, HELL,
      YOU COULDN'T SAY NO.

           - [laughs]
- IN FRONT OF ALL THOSE PEOPLE.
    - HE'S VERY, VERY BRAVE.
          - ALL RIGHT.
       HE WAS VERY SMART.

     RUCHI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - I WOULD SAY "FINALLY,"
           BECAUSE...
       WE GOT PRE-ENGAGED
        IN OUR CULTURE.

            - OKAY.
     - LIKE, A YEAR BEFORE.
       SO THAT WHOLE YEAR
  I WAS ANTICIPATING THE RING,
       AND THEN FINALLY.

     HE HAD THE WHOLE YEAR
       TO, LIKE, PROPOSE,
  AND THEN IT WAS AT THE END,
        DECEMBER FIFTH.
         - SO YOU WERE
     JUST LIKE, "FINALLY."

        - FINALLY, YEAH.
      - AND YOU SAID YEAH.
             OKAY.
          - [giggles]
   - JOHANNA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

           - I'D SAY
     HE WAS RIGHT ON TIME.
            - OKAY.
 - SO WE WERE LIVING TOGETHER,
   AND WE--HE SAID, YOU KNOW,
 "HEY, YOU WANNA GET MARRIED?"

      AND I SAID, "OKAY."
          - [laughing]
            - OKAY.
   JUST ALL IN A DAY'S WORK.
            - YEAH.
           - GOT YOU.

           ALL RIGHT.
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.
       MY HUSBAND THINKS
    THAT WHEN HE WEARS BLANK

          HE'S MAKING
      A FASHION STATEMENT,
     BUT I THINK IT'S MORE
     OF A FAS<i>RUCHI.AUX PAS.</i>
           - HE LIKES
     HIS CORDUROY JACKET...

          THAT I DON'T
   THINK REALLY LOOKS GREAT.
       - NOT SEXY AT ALL.
             OKAY.
  DOES IT HAVE THOSE PATCHES?

             - NO.
           - OH, NO.
      I WAS LIKE, "IF IT'S
   GOT THOSE PATCHES, WHEW."
             OKAY.
    JOHANNA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

           - DENIM...
      LIKE, A DENIM SHIRT
       OR A DENIM JACKET.
    HE WILL WEAR BLUE JEANS
      WITH A DENIM SHIRT,

      WHICH IS...NOT COOL.
           - GOT YOU.
             SANDY?
    - HIS BLACK SILK BOXERS

        WITH THE LITTLE
    SMOOCHIE THINGS ON THEM.
          I HATE THEM.
         - LIKE, THOSE
      LITTLE KISSY FACES?

  - I THINK I GAVE THEM TO HIM
    IN, LIKE--WHEN I WAS 16.
           [laughing]
         - WELL, MAYBE
      THAT'S A COMPLIMENT.

            MAYBE HE
      THINKS YOU LIKE THEM
  'CAUSE YOU GAVE THEM TO HIM.
         - I HATE THEM.
     TIME TO MOVE ON, MAN.
          - LET IT GO.

           LET IT GO!
           ALL RIGHT,
     NEXT QUESTION, LADIES.
        THIS SUMMER SAW
     A HORRIBLE INFESTATION

          OF BED BUGS
       IN NEW YORK CITY.
          SO TELL ME,
      WHAT'S THE ONE THING
    YOUR HUSBAND DOES IN BED
     THAT REALLY BUGS YOU?

            JOHANNA.
             - OH.
     HE CLIPS HIS TOENAILS.
             - OH!
       - IT'S DISGUSTING.
           - IN BED?

    - HE JUST WAITS TOO LONG
       AND THEY'RE...EW.
         - OH, THEY'RE
       LIKE EAGLE TALONS.
             WHOO!
             SANDY.

          - HE DOESN'T
     KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT--
         OR PRETENDS HE
  DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO MAKE IT.
            THE BED.
      - OH, MAKE THE BED?

     HE PRETENDS HE DOESN'T
   KNOW HOW TO MAKE THE BED?
- YEAH, HE MAKES IT WRONG, LIKE,
   UPSIDE-DOWN AND BACKWARDS.
          - HE'S DOING
   ALL THIS STUFF ON PURPOSE

    JUST TO MAKE YOU UPSET.
   - I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.
    - I CAN SEE YOUR HUSBAND
      COMING A MILE AWAY.
     RUCHI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

         - I WOULD SAY
   THAT WHEN HE FALLS ASLEEP,
    SOMETIMES HE'S SO TIRED
       THAT HE JUST GOES
      TO--STRAIGHT TO BED.

           - AND THAT
     JUST REALLY BUGS YOU?
            - YEAH.
           - BECAUSE?
           - BECAUSE.
           [giggles]

         - BECAUSE...?
      - BECAU--WE'LL BE--
 WE'LL BE DOING THIS ALL NIGHT.
          - [giggles]

      - ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
  HERE IS OUR BONUS QUESTION.
       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
          HERE WE GO.

            COMPLETE
     THIS SENTENCE, LADIES.
         MY HUSBAND IS
    ABOUT BLANK PERCENT MAN.
     AND BLANK PERCENT BOY.

             SANDY.
             - MM.
       70% MAN, 30% BOY.
            BECAUSE
   HE'S STILL PRETTY PLAYFUL,

  BUT HE'S DEFINITELY THE MORE
     RESPONSIBLE AND MATURE
       ONE OF THE GROUP.
            - YEAH.
    - MINUS MAKING THE BED.

            - OKAY.
             RUCHI?
    - I WOULD SAY 85 AND 15.
           - 85% MAN?
            - YEAH.

           - 15% BOY.
     - WHAT'S THE 15% BOY?
           - WE HAVE
   NICKNAMES FOR EACH OTHER.

         - OH, TELL ME!
           - HE LIKES
      TO CALL ME SNOTFACE.
           [giggles]
          - SNOTFACE?

          - [giggles]
             YEAH.
     - THAT IS SO ROMANTIC!
           - I KNOW.
          - SNOTFACE.
           I LOVE IT.

         AND PRAY TELL,
     WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM?
      - I CALL HIM <i>SNOTALU.</i>
          IT'S ANOTHER
