       AND NOW YOUR HOST,
        SHERRI SHEPERD.

       - THANK YOU, GARY.
       THE GUYS ARE BACK,
    SO LET'S SEE IF THE MEN
           CAN MATCH
     WHAT THE LADIES SAID.

      HERE'S THE FIRST OF
    OUR TEN-POINT QUESTIONS.
      GENTLEMEN, THEY SAY
     THAT TIME STANDS STILL
      WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE.

          BUT WHEN YOU
  FINALLY POPPED THE QUESTION,
     HOW DID YOUR WIFE SAY
  SHE REACTED TO YOUR TIMING?
     "FINALLY," "ALREADY,"
    OR "RIGHT ON SCHEDULE"?

             DANNY.
     - I WOULD SAY THAT SHE
 WOULD SAY "RIGHT ON SCHEDULE."
             - WHY?
         - EVEN THOUGH

      WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER
       EIGHT-PLUS YEARS,
          WE--WE WERE
      YOUNG AND NOT READY.
    SO I THINK AT THE TIME,
     I THINK WE WERE READY.

       RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.
      - WHAT DID YOU SAY?
            - WHOO!
      - RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.
          - GOOD JOB.

            - YEAH.
      ALL RIGHT, AMITABH,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - ALL RIGHT, THIS
    IS GONNA BE AN EASY ONE.

        IT'S DEFINITELY
      GONNA BE "FINALLY."
      - YOU DRAGGED IT OUT
           THAT LONG?
    - TO THE VERY END, YEAH.

          - ALL RIGHT,
     SO YOU SAY "FINALLY."
       - I SAY "FINALLY."
    - RUCHI, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - I SAID FINALLY.
           - FINALLY!

           [giggles]
            - YEAH.
        - I HAD TO WAIT
          FOR A WHILE.
       - ALL RIGHT, MIKE,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

   - IT'S JUST--IT'S LIKE IT
     WAS SO MATTER-OF-FACT.
      SO I THINK IT WOULD
    PROBABLY SAY "FINALLY."
            - BUT IT
    STILL WORKED OUT, YEAH?

      - YEAH, IT SURE DID.
          - ALL RIGHT.
      SO WHAT DID YOU SAY?
       RIGHT ON SCHEDULE.

         [audience aws]
       THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
       WE STILL GOT TIME.
        both: [chuckles]
          - ALL RIGHT.

  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
       MY HUSBAND THINKS
    THAT WHEN HE WEARS BLANK
          HE'S MAKING
      A FASHION STATEMENT,

        BUT I THINK IT'S
   MORE OF A FASHION <i>FAUX PAS.</i>
            AMITABH.
       - SHE REALLY HATES
        THIS ONE PAIR OF
    DARK JEANS THAT I HAVE.

  - WHY DOES SHE NOT LIKE IT?
    - I DON'T KNOW, THEY'RE
 A GOOD-LOOKING PAIR OF JEANS.
  I FEEL COMFORTABLE IN THEM.

           I DON'T--
      I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
            - RUCHI,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - I TOTALLY
   FORGOT ABOUT THOSE JEANS.

      - A CORDUROY JACKET.
  SO IT'S NOT ONLY THE JEANS,
      IT'S THE JACKET TOO.
          - [chuckles]
        - OKAY, GOT YOU.

             MIKE.
    - IT'D HAVE TO BE DENIM.
 BECAUSE I HAVE A DENIM JACKET,
   AND I LIKE WEARING JEANS.
      AND SOMETIMES I LIKE
     TO WEAR THEM TOGETHER.

     BUT SHE SAYS, "NO YOU
    ARE NOT STEPPING OUTSIDE
          OF THE HOUSE
     WEARING THAT OUTFIT."
    - OKAY, WELL, LET'S SEE.
   JOHANNA, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - A DENIM SHIRT.
           ALL RIGHT!
          - ALL RIGHT!
        - THERE YOU GO.
            - MWAH.

          - [chuckles]
           - YOU WEAR
       THAT DENIM SHIRT.
       PUT THAT THING ON,
      IT EARNS YOU POINTS.

           ALL RIGHT,
   WHAT WOULD YOU SAY, DANNY?
    - I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY
     MY HOODED SWEATSHIRT.
    - WHAT DO YOU LOOK LIKE
    IN A HOODED SWEATSHIRT?

           - FASHION.
         I LOOK GREAT.
          I LOOK GREAT
     IN HOODED SWEATSHIRTS.
  - IT'S A FASHION STATEMENT.
     - THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

       - AND YOU LIKE IT.
   - I LOVE IT, SHE HATES IT.
   - WELL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
        DO YOU HATE IT?
     - I DO HATE THOSE TOO,
             BUT...

            - BOXERS
     WITH THE KISSY PRINT.
             - OH!
          - [laughing]
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.

    NEXT QUESTION, COUPLES.
        THIS SUMMER SAW
     A HORRIBLE INFESTATION
          OF BED BUGS
       IN NEW YORK CITY.

       SO TELL ME, WHAT'S
 THE ONE THINGS YOUR WIFE SAID
         YOU DO IN BED
     THAT REALLY BUGS HER?
             MIKE.

      - OH, THIS IS EASY.
            [scoffs]
    SHE CONSTANTLY TELLS ME
        NOT TO DO THIS.
   I CLIP MY TOENAILS IN BED.

       - WHO RAISED YOU,
            A WOLF?
          - [chuckles]
       - DO YOU AT LEAST
   GET THE SHAVINGS, AND...?

         - YEAH, I DO.
    I CLEAN UP AFTER MYSELF.
            - OKAY,
  WE GOTTA WORK ON YOU, MIKE.
       WHAT DID YOU SAY,
            JOHANNA?

      CLIPS HIS TOENAILS.
            - YEAH.
         - DISGUSTING.
           - UH-HUH.

             DANNY.
         - I THINK SHE
    WOULD SAY WHEN SHE TRIES
      TO CUDDLE UP TO ME,
   AND I TURN THE OTHER WAY.

             - WHY?
       - IT'S TOTALLY...
     I'M NOT CONSCIOUS WHEN
  I'M DOING IT, I'M SLEEPING.
           AND THEN I
   WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING,

        AND SHE'LL SAY,
  "WHY DID YOU PUSH ME AWAY?"
    I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO.
        IT'S JUST..I...
   - ARE YOU WEARING THE SILK
  BOXERS WITH THE KISSY FACES?

          - [chuckles]
   MAYBE THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
        - I DON'T KNOW,
 MAYBE YOU SHOULD PUT THEM ON.
            - MAYBE,
    I'LL TRY THAT NEXT TIME.

           - MAKES IT
     A LITTLE BIT ROMANTIC.
           ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      PRETENDS HE DOESN'T
   KNOW HOW TO MAKE THE BED.

            - YEAH.
             - OOH.
        - IS THAT TRUE?
        DO YOU PRETEND?
          - I KNOW HOW
     TO MAKE THE BED, YES.

            - YOU...
          - I TOLD YOU
     HE DOES IT ON PURPOSE.
             - YES,
      QUITE ENLIGHTENING.

            - OKAY.
    AMITABH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
        - IN BED, I LIKE
  TO CUDDLE AND SLEEP ALL DAY.

      AND IF SHE WANTS ME
    TO GET OUT AND DO WORK,
    CLEAN UP THE APARTMENT,
     THOSE KINDS OF THINGS,
           BUT I JUST
       WANNA STAY IN BED.

     AND I TRY TO BRING HER
       IN THERE WITH ME,
            AND JUST
     CUDDLE HER AND SLEEP.
    BUT SHE DOESN'T LIKE IT.

          - ALL RIGHT.
    RUCHI, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
          - I SAID...
     - GO STRAIGHT TO BED.
           - WELL...
            - YEAH.

           [giggles]
           ALL RIGHT,
    LET'S SEE WHERE WE ARE.

  GENTLEMEN, HOW DID YOUR WIFE
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
         MY HUSBAND IS
    ABOUT BLANK PERCENT MAN
     AND BLANK PERCENT BOY.

             DANNY.
      - 90% MAN, 10% BOY.
             - AH.
    WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY?

            - 70-30.
            - 70-30,
         I'M SO SORRY.
    AMITABH, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

            - 50-50.
            - OKAY.
    AND YOU'RE LIKE A BABY,
    YOU LIKE TO SLEEP A LOT.
          - [chuckles]

     TO MATCH YOUR ANSWERS.
THE COUPLE WITH THE MOST POINTS
     AT THE END OF THE GAME

      WILL WIN A FANTASTIC
       SECOND HONEYMOON.
      SO IF YOU ARE READY,
   HERE'S THE FIRST QUESTION.
       YOU READY, FELLAS?

            - READY.
         - HERE WE GO.
    GENTLEMEN, THE LAST TIME
      YOU AND YOUR LADIES
  SET OUT TO CREATE FIREWORKS
        IN THE BEDROOM,

     HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE
         HER EXPLOSION:
        ONE BIG KABOOM,
       MULTIPLE RUMBLERS,
           OR A DUD?

    BRIAN, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
     - WOW. UM, I WOULD SAY
       MULTIPLE RUMBLERS.
 DEFINITELY MULTIPLE RUMBLERS.
 - IS THAT A NORMAL OCCURRENCE?

 - I WOULD SAY--A LOT OF TIMES
      IT'S ONE BIG KABOOM.
     BUT THE LAST TIME WAS
        - OH, ALL RIGHT.
  AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, HOWARD?

        - THE LAST TIME
     WE MADE THAT STUFF...
           [laughter]
       I WOULD SAY IT WAS
         A BIG KABOOM.

         - NOW, IS THAT
      A NORMAL OCCURRENCE,
     OR DO YOU USUALLY HAVE
       MULTIPLE RUMBLERS?
        OR IS IT ALWAYS
         A BIG KABOOM?

       - WELL, YOU KNOW,
    SHE'S THE TYPE OF PERSON
  THAT LIKES TO WARM UP TO IT,
      SO SHE'LL HOLD IT--
    HOLD IT UNTIL THAT SPOT,
  AND THEN IT'S A BIG KABOOM.

         - WHOO! WHOO!
     CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.
       OKAY. AND, WAYNE,
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
      - WELL, IT'S USUALLY
  A BIG KABOOM FOR ME, I KNOW.

           [laughter]
       IT WAS VERY RECENT
           IN MEMORY,
       SO I THINK IT WAS
      A MULTIPLE RUMBLER.

        - THERE YOU GO.
           ALL RIGHT.
    HUSBANDS' NEXT QUESTION.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE.

        WHEN I FIRST MET
       MY MOTHER-IN-LAW,
      THE FIRST WORD THAT
    CAME TO MIND WAS BLANK.
            HOWARD?

   - SO THIS IS WHAT MY WIFE
       IS GONNA LOOK LIKE
     IN THE NEXT 40 YEARS.
    OKAY, I'LL GO WITH THAT.

     - OKAY, SO IF YOU CAN
 PUT THAT DOWN INTO ONE WORD...
          - OH, OKAY.
       IT WAS, UM, "WOW."

             - WOW?
           - MM-HMM.
            - YEAH,
SHE'S AN ATTRACTIVE WOMAN, HUH?
      - YEAH, FOR HER AGE.
          - ALL RIGHT.

           ALL RIGHT.
    - SHE'S GOT IT GOING ON.
         - OKAY, WAYNE,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
       - YOU KNOW, I WAS
      GONNA SAY "WOW" TOO.

            CAN I--
         - ABSOLUTELY.
   - CAN I REPEAT AN ANSWER?
    IT WAS DEFINITELY "WOW."
     THAT'S THE FIRST THING
      THAT CAME TO MY MIND

         BECAUSE SHE'S
     A VERY STUNNING LADY.
           - IS SHE?
             - YES.
      - OKAY. I LOVE THIS.

   BRIAN, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
      - I THOUGHT "THIN."
     THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
     - THIN. YOU LIKE THAT?
    - THIN. I THOUGHT THIN.

     - SHE'S VERY HEALTHY?
- MY WIFE WILL BE THIN AS WELL.
      YEAH, VERY HEALTHY,
        FIT, THIN WOMAN.
     THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
            - OKAY.

           ALL RIGHT,
   NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.
        ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
   HERE AT <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>

       SIZE DOES MATTER.
   SO HOW TALL WOULD YOU SAY
         YOUR WIFE IS?
             WAYNE.

          - UM...5'6".
            - 5'6"?
       HOW TALL ARE YOU?
          - I'M 5'8".

            - 5'8".
            - YEAH.
     - SO SHE'S ABOUT 5'6"?
           - MM-HMM.
        - FITS PERFECT.
     - IT IS A PERFECT FIT.

  HER HEAD IS RIGHT UNDERNEATH
    YOUR CHIN KINDA, RIGHT?
           - USUALLY.
           [laughter]

             OOPS.
        [audience oohs]
            - BRIAN,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

    AND SHE'S GONNA KILL ME.
       I THINK SHE'S 5'6"
            AS WELL.
       IT MIGHT BE 5'7".

 AND THAT'S WHERE I'M THINKING
         I DON'T KNOW.
             5'6".
    I'M GONNA GO WITH 5'6".
  - YOU'RE GONNA GO WITH 5'6"?
      - 5'6". LET'S DO IT.

         - AND, HOWARD,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - HMM, LET'S SEE, IS THAT WHEN
      I'M PICKING HER UP,
    OR WHEN SHE'S IN HEELS?

      - I THINK IT'S WHEN
  SHE'S STANDING NEXT TO YOU.
     - OH, IT'S FLAT FOOT?
            - IT'S--
     - OKAY, I'LL SAY 5'8".
      - ABOUT 5'8". OKAY.

            SO NOW,
  WHEN YOU'RE PICKING HER UP,
        HOW TALL IS SHE?
          - UH, 6'3".
             - OH!

       THAT DEFIES LOGIC.
    OKAY, FELLAS, NICE JOB.
       WHILE WERE WAITING
   FOR THE LADIES TO RETURN,

    GARY, TELL US ALL ABOUT
 THAT SECOND HONEYMOON VACATION
      THEY'RE PLAYING FOR.
 - TONIGHT'S WINNING NEWLYWEDS
   ARE GOING BREEZES BAHAMAS.

       GUESTS AT BREEZES
  WILL ENJOY A WIDE SELECTION

       OF DINING OPTIONS.
             ENJOY.
  - NOW, THAT SOUNDS AMAZING.

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
      WHILE YOU WERE GONE,
     I ASKED YOUR HUSBANDS
        THREE QUESTIONS,
     AND NOW IT'S YOUR JOB
TO TRY AND MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

     EACH CORRECT ANSWER IS
       WORTH FIVE POINTS,
         SO HERE WE GO
    WITH THE FIRST QUESTION.
     LADIES, THE LAST TIME
        YOU AND YOUR MAN

  SET OUT TO CREATE FIREWORKS
        IN THE BEDROOM,
     HOW WOULD HE DESCRIBE
        YOUR EXPLOSION:
        ONE BIG KABOOM,
       MULTIPLE RUMBLERS,

           OR A DUD?
    HOLLY, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
         - I WOULD SAY
       MULTIPLE RUMBLERS.

   - WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?
   - I WOULD SAY THAT BECAUSE
        HE'S PRETTY GOOD
    AT WHAT HE DOES, AND...

     - AH. IS THIS A NORMAL
          OCCURRENCE,
     THE MULTIPLE RUMBLERS?
       - OH, YEAH. DAILY.
          - OH, YEAH?

           ALL RIGHT.
    WELL, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
      - MULTIPLE RUMBLERS!
     [cheers and applause]

      ALL RIGHT, DAPHINIE,
      NOW WHAT DO YOU SAY?
       - UM, I WOULD SAY
       MULTIPLE RUMBLERS.
   - IS THAT A NORMAL THING?
            - YEAH.

     - NO--NO BIG KABOOMS?
      - YEAH, BUT I THINK
        THIS WEEKEND WAS
       MULTIPLE RUMBLERS.
             - AH!

     OKAY, WHAT'D YOU SAY,
            HOWARD?
          - ONE BIG--
       - ONE BIG KABOOM.
    IT'S OKAY. A BIG KABOOM
     AND MULTIPLE RUMBLERS,

      THEY'RE STILL GOOD.
     - OH, I'M SORRY, BABY.
          - ALL RIGHT,
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA SAY, LISA?

- I WOULD SAY MULTIPLE RUMBLERS.
            ALWAYS.
      - ALWAYS? ALL RIGHT.
        WHAT DO YOU SAY?
       MULTIPLE RUMBLERS!

     [cheers and applause]
           ALL RIGHT.
      HERE WE GO, LADIES.
         NEXT QUESTION.

      HOW DID YOUR HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE?
        WHEN I FIRST MET
       MY MOTHER-IN-LAW,
         THE FIRST WORD
THAT CAME TO MY MIND WAS BLANK.

           DAPHINIE?
    - WELL, MY MOTHER AND I,
YOU KNOW, WE REALLY LOOK ALIKE,
      SO I THINK HE WAS--
      I DON'T KNOW, "WOW."

          - ALL RIGHT,
     IS THAT WHAT YOU SAY?
      WHAT'D YOU SAY? WOW!
             - WOW.
     [cheers and applause]

      - YOUR MOTHER LOOKS
         JUST LIKE YOU?
     - YEAH, WE LOOK ALIKE.
       - CONGRATULATIONS.

        ALL RIGHT, LISA,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - UM, HE'D PROBABLY BE,
          LIKE, UM...
     HE WAS PROBABLY, LIKE,
           "OH, BOY."

  I HAVE A STRONG ITALIAN MOM.
            - YEAH?
   WHAT DID YOUR HUSBAND SAY?
         HE SAID "WOW."

          - YOU KNOW,
      YOUR MOM'S AMAZING.
         SHE COMES FROM
        THIS BIG FAMILY
    WITH ALL THESE BROTHERS
          AND SISTERS,

      AND STUNNING AND...
           YOU KNOW.
     - CAN'T BE MAD AT HIM
           FOR THAT.
            - OKAY.
       - YEAH, SEE? AWW.

         THERE YOU GO.
       ALL RIGHT, HOLLY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - I WOULD SAY HE SAID "CUTE."

   BECAUSE MY MOM'S JUST VERY
 CUTE AND BUBBLY AND FRIENDLY.
          - ALL RIGHT,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
    - I WAS GONNA SAY THAT,
       BUT I SAID "THIN."

        - HE SAID THIN.
        BUT YOU'D RATHER
         HE SAID CUTE.
     - YEAH, BUT SHE'S THIN
        AND SHE'S CUTE.

   - I WOULD HAVE SAID CUTE.
        SHE'S WATCHING--
       SHE'S GONNA WATCH.
    I WOULD HAVE SAID CUTE.
      I WAS THINKING SWEET

  - WELL, TELL HER WHAT YOU--
      TELL HER WHAT YOU--
       - YOU'RE SO CUTE,
        YOU'RE SO SWEET.
        AND YOU'RE THIN.

           [laughter]
          - WE GOT IT.
          SHE GOT IT.
   - THIN IN A GOOD WAY, MOM.

    - THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT.
         IN A GOOD WAY.
      OUR FINAL QUESTION,
            COUPLES.
   HERE AT <i>THE NEWLYWED GAME,</i>
         <i>SIZE MATTERS.</i>

  SO HOW TALL DID YOUR HUSBAND
          SAY YOU ARE?
             LISA?
  - HE BETTER HAVE SAID 5'1".

            - 5'1"?
            - WHAT?
        - ARE YOU 5'1"?
          YOU'RE 5'1"?
            - YEAH!

         - OKAY, HUBBY,

    WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?

   - OKAY, WAIT, YOU'RE 5'1".
    WHERE DID YOU GET 5'6"?
        - I DON'T KNOW.
        I THOUGHT 5'6".
    - YOU THINK YOU'RE 5'6".

  - HOW TALL IS YOUR HUSBAND?
          - 5'8"-ISH.
         - 5'6", 5'7".
          - I'M 5'8"!
         - YOU'RE 5'7".

       - I'M 5'7", MAYBE.
    WE'RE GONNA MEASURE YOU
       WHEN WE GET HOME.
    - HOLLY, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - WELL, I--I'M 5'6".
         - YOU'RE 5'6".
     AND WHAT DID YOU SAY?
             5'6"!
            - WHOO!

        GOOD JOB, BABY.
     [cheers and applause]
     - ALL RIGHT, DAPHINIE,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?

        - I'LL SAY 5'7".
            - 5'7".
   HOW TALL IS YOUR HUSBAND?
          - HE'S 6'3".

        SO YOU'RE 5'7"?
    - I HOPE YOU SAID 5'7".
       - YOU FIT NEATLY.
           ALL RIGHT,
   WHAT DID YOU SAY, HOWARD?

            - 5'8".
            - 5'8"?
          - ALL RIGHT,
       COUPLE NUMBER ONE
         IS IN THE LEAD
        WITH TEN POINTS.

  COUPLE NUMBER TWO AND THREE
   ARE TIED WITH FIVE POINTS.
       WHEN WE COME BACK,
     IT IS THE LADIES' TURN
    TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS.

         AND THIS TIME,
    THE POINTS ARE DOUBLED,
         SO STAY TUNED.
     [cheers and applause]

       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
        IT IS YOUR TURN
   TO ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
   THESE NEXT THREE ARE WORTH
        TEN POINTS EACH.

  AND OUR FIRST QUESTION IS...
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE,
            LADIES.
       I'LL NEVER FORGET
         THAT ONE TIME

     WE WERE GETTING BUSY,
    AND WE WERE INTERRUPTED
           BY BLANK.
             HOLLY?

    - WELL, ONE TIME WE WERE
        AWAY ON VACATION
    IN A HOT WATER SPRINGS,
     AND WE GOT INTERRUPTED
       BY ANOTHER COUPLE.

       - WERE THEY DOING
        THE SAME THING?
      - I THINK THEY WERE.
          IT WAS DARK,
       AND WE DIDN'T KNOW
        THEY WERE THERE.

     AND ALL OF A SUDDEN--
            [gasps]
  - AND WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO?
      DID YOU KEEP GOING,
   OR DID YOU STOP AND WATCH?

     - WE MOVED LOCATIONS.
       - AND KEPT GOING.
            - YEAH.
        - MM. ALL RIGHT.
   DAPHINIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - FOR US, WELL,
     IT'S AN ONGOING THING.
   WE ALWAYS GET INTERRUPTED
          BY OUR DOG.
          - YOUR DOG?
             - YES.

   - WHAT'S YOUR DOG'S NAME?
            - MOCHA.
           - REALLY?
   YOU DON'T CLOSE THE DOOR?
         - WE...WE DO.
         - BUT MOCHA--

     - IT'S LIKE SOMETIMES,
    WHEN IT'S IN THE MOMENT,
     YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT
       CLOSING THE DOOR.
    - OKAY, WHAT DO YOU SAY,
             LISA?

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
        IT WAS PROBABLY
       WHEN WE WERE JUST
        LIVING TOGETHER,
          AND MY NIECE
      WAS STAYING WITH US.

          AND WE WERE
      IN THE LIVING ROOM,
    AND SHE CAME DOWNSTAIRS.
   WE THOUGHT SHE WAS ASLEEP.

    SHE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING,
         I DON'T THINK.
  - IT WAS JUST SO--IT WAS HOT
   AND HEATED AND PASSIONATE,
  AND YOU DIDN'T EVEN GET TIME
   TO GO TO THE BEDROOM, HUH?

 - YEAH, WE JUST KIND OF, LIKE,
     PUT BLANKETS AROUND US
         AND ACTED LIKE
      WE WERE WATCHING TV.
   - OKAY. ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
         NEXT QUESTION.

        WHAT'S ONE ITEM
   OF YOUR HUSBAND'S CLOTHING
        THAT REMINDS YOU
  HE SHOULD NEVER SHOP ALONE?
           DAPHINIE?

         - OH, MY GOSH.
       HE HAS THESE NASTY
         PURPLE SHORTS.
            - YEAH?
             - YES.

     - YOU DON'T LIKE 'EM?
   - NO. THEY'RE REVERSIBLE,
     SO ONE SIDE IS PURPLE
  AND THE OTHER SIDE IS GREEN.
        IT IS HORRIBLE.

  - DOES HE LIKE THESE SHORTS?
           - HE DOES.
         AND RIGHT NOW
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.
           [laughter]

        - I WONDER WHERE
         THEY COULD BE.
   DO WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE?
 - NO, I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU.
            - OKAY.

 'CAUSE YOU'D HAVE TO KILL ME.
             OKAY.
  - I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY
      THE SHIRTS HE BOUGHT
        SAYING THEY WERE
         FROM THE '60s,

        THAT EVERYBODY'S
         WEARING THEM.
   AND I HAVEN'T SEEN ANYBODY
           [laughter]
            NOBODY.

   ONE LOOKS LIKE A CURTAIN,
 THE OTHER'S, LIKE, A PAISLEY.
       ONE'S GOT FLOWERS.
      - OKAY. AND, HOLLY,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        - IT'S ACTUALLY
       THESE BLUE SHORTS,
      BUT THE ISSUE IS NOT
          THE SHORTS.
  IT'S WHAT HE TRIES TO MATCH
        WITH THE SHORTS.

       SO HE WEARS, LIKE,
          BLUE SHORTS
       WITH A BLUE SHIRT,
   AND HE'S, LIKE, ALL BLUE.
    OR THEN HE WEARS, LIKE,
BLUE SHORTS WITH A BLACK SHIRT.

        - IT DOESN'T GO.
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT,
         NEXT QUESTION.
     THIS NEXT QUESTION IS
         BROUGHT TO YOU

      BY FAMOUS FOOTWEAR,
  FANTASTIC BRAND NAME SHOES.
  YOU'RE AT A MOVIE PREMIERE,
       AND JUDE LAW WANTS
       TO POSE WITH YOU.

  DOES YOUR HUSBAND STAND BACK
  AND LET YOU HAVE THE MOMENT,
      STEP IN AND BE PART
         OF THE PHOTO,
  OR GRAB THE NEAREST STARLET
    FOR A PHOTO OF HIS OWN?

             LISA?
   - OH, DEFINITELY HE WOULD
      JUMP IN. DEFINITELY.
       - HE WOULD JUMP IN
     WITH YOU AND JUDE LAW?

      - OH, YEAH, HE'D BE
    RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE.
        - OKAY, GOT YOU.
             HOLLY?
      - HE WOULD JUMP IN.
   HE WOULD BE A PART OF IT.

     LISA, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
       - HE WOULD JUMP IN
      AND BE A PART OF IT.
      GOT YOU. I GOT YOU.
      ALL RIGHT, DAPHINIE.

    - I THINK HE'LL STAND BY
   AND LET ME HAVE MY MOMENT.
          - HE WOULD?
- I WOULD THINK HE WOULD WANT--
    IF IT WAS SOMEONE ELSE,
             MAYBE.

BUT I DON'T THINK HE WOULD WANT
TO TAKE A PICTURE WITH JUDE LAW.
          - ALL RIGHT.
         OKAY, LADIES.
           NOW HERE'S
      OUR BONUS QUESTION.

       IT HAS TWO PARTS.
 EACH PART IS WORTH 15 POINTS.
         SO HERE WE GO.
  LADIES, IF YOU WERE TO GRADE
   YOUR HUSBAND'S PERFORMANCE

        IN THE BEDROOM,
       WHERE WOULD HE GET
            AN "A,"
     AND WHERE WOULD HE GET
          JUST A "C"?

             HOLLY?
     - HE WOULD GET AN "A"
       IN THE POSITIONS.
      - IN THE POSITIONS?
    - HE LIKES TO, YOU KNOW,

     TAKE CONTROL AND HAVE
      DIFFERENT POSITIONS.
          - ALL RIGHT.
    - UM, HE WOULD GET A "C"
      IN GETTING STARTED,

      'CAUSE HE JUST GOES
         RIGHT FOR IT.
    - OKAY, SO THAT'S WHERE
        HE'D GET A "C"?
            - YEAH.
          - ALL RIGHT.

           DAPHINIE,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?
     - HE WOULD GET AN "A"
     WITH GOING DOWN THERE.
           [laughter]

  - THAT'S WHY YOU GOT A SMILE
      ON YOUR FACE, GIRL.
    - HE WOULD GET A "C" IN,
     I GUESS, THE KISSING.
   WE DON'T DO MUCH KISSING.
          - OH, OKAY.

     SO I THINK, YOU KNOW,
    HE'LL GET A "C" ON THAT.
    - AND THE KISSING PART.
            - YEAH.
      - GOTCHA. AND, LISA,
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

         - I WOULD SAY
      HE WOULD GET AN "A"
      FOR THE MAIN EVENT.
       - THE MAIN EVENT.
      - AND PROBABLY A "C"
          AT FOREPLAY.

 SOMETIMES HE JUST CAN'T WAIT.
    - OKAY, BEFORE THEY EVEN
         SHOOT THE GUN,
     HE'S JUST GONE. OKAY.

            GOTCHA.
   THANK YOU SO MUCH, LADIES.
        WHEN WE RETURN,
         WE WILL SEE IF
       THEIR HUSBANDS CAN
      MATCH THEIR ANSWERS.

          STAY TUNED.

I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT ONE TIME
     WE WERE GETTING BUSY,
    AND WE WERE INTERRUPTED
           BY BLANK.

             BRIAN?
     - UM, WHENEVER WE GET
          INTERRUPTED,
   USUALLY IT'S BY THE PHONE.

     - YOU GOT INTERRUPTED
       BY THE TELEPHONE?
        WHO DID YOU SAY?

       - WHAT DO YOU SAY,
            HOWARD?
         - UM, I GUESS

        - WHAT'S MOCHA?
      - MOCHA IS MY DOGGY.
      YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
      SHE LIKES TO COME IN

      AND BE, LIKE, "HEY!"
  YOU KNOW, "WHAT'S GOING ON?"
     YOU KNOW, CHEWING THIS
  AND CHEWING THAT, YOU KNOW.
   AND THEN YOU HAVE TO STOP
AND BE, LIKE, "GET OUT OF HERE!"

     - WHAT WOULD YOU SAY,
           DAPHINIE?
         OUR DOG MOCHA!
     [cheers and applause]

     WAYNE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

        A FAMILY MEMBER,

         LIKE A NIECE.
           - MM-HMM.
       AND WHAT HAPPENED?
     - CAME INTO THE HOUSE.
  WE WERE IN THE LIVING ROOM.

   - AND YOUR NIECE CAME INTO
        THE LIVING ROOM?
   - WE HEARD, LIKE, SOMEBODY
    COMING THROUGH THE DOOR,
    AND IT WAS, "HURRY UP."
YOU KNOW, "COVER UP. BLANKETS."

          - ALL RIGHT.
    WHAT DID YOUR WIFE SAY?
       IT WAS YOUR NIECE!

    TOTAL ALPHA, LOVE PUPPY
          OR LAP DOG?
    WHAT DO YOU SAY, DORIEN?

    UH, I'M A MAN IN CHARGE,
      SO I THINK SHE'D SAY
      I'M THE TOTAL ALPHA.
- WHAT ARE YOU IN CHARGE ABOUT?
 - I'M IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING.

YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF EVERYTHING?
       YOU ARE THE ALPHA.
 - RIGHT NOW, UNTIL SHE COMES.
       - UNTIL SHE COMES.
       AND THEN YOU TURN

    I LIKE TO, UH, YOU KNOW,
  TAKE CONTROL IN THE BEDROOM
         AND, YOU KNOW,
       GO WITH THE FLOW.

       - ALL RIGHT. BRAD?
     - WELL, THE TRUTH IS,
   PROBABLY CLOSER TO ALPHA,
BUT A SMART ALPHA LETS THE WIFE
    THINK HE'S THE LAP DOG.

        - THERE YOU GO.
         THERE YOU GO.
   - THAT'S A GOOD ALPHA. ALL
RIGHT. NEXT QUESTION, GENTLEMEN.
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE:

    SOMETIMES I WISH MY WIFE
       PUT AS MUCH ENERGY
   TOWARDS OUR BEDROOM ANTICS
   AS SHE PUTS TOWARDS BLANK.
              JOE?

       - SHE'S, YOU KNOW,
          HEADSTRONG,
          VERY FORWARD

      ADOPTED TWO KITTENS.
    AND IF I COULD COME BACK
            IN LIFE

   AS ONE OF HER TWO KITTENS.
 - WHAT'S IT LIKE A TYPICAL DAY
       FOR THESE KITTENS?
     - OH. THEY EAT BETTER
           THAN I DO.

           - REALLY?
            - YEAH.
 - AND WHAT ABOUT THE CUDDLING
       WITH THE KITTENS?
    - THEY'RE IN BED WITH US
         ALL THE TIME.

     - OH, YOU'RE KIDD--OH.
          - SO, I HAVE
       TO KICK THEM OUT.
            - YEAH?
           - UH-HUH.

   - DORIEN, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
    - ALL SHE DOES IS SHOP,
      SO IF SHE WAS ALWAYS
         IN THE BEDROOM

  INSTEAD OF ALWAYS SHOPPING,
      WE'D HAVE MORE MONEY
         AND MORE FUN.
        - THERE YOU GO.
        SUCCINCTLY PUT.

     ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN,
  THIS IS OUR FINAL QUESTION.

      A PENNY FOR EACH GUY

          YOU THOUGHT
     YOUR WIFE SLEPT WITH,
  HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD YOU BE
       HOLDING RIGHT NOW?
              HMM.

             BRAD.
      - I DON'T KNOW, UM,
      LET'S SAY 15 CENTS.
       - AND--AND--YOU--
      WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

  - UM, I DON'T KNOW, WE NEVER
 REALLY COMPARED NUMBERS, UM--
    - YOU ARE A SMART ALPHA.
   YOU NEVER ASKED, DID YOU?
   - A SMART GUY NEVER ASKS.
         - NEVER ASKS.

    WHAT ABOUT YOU, DORIEN?
  - UH, A NICKEL. FIVE CENTS.
         - FIVE CENTS?
    - YEAH, ALL I WANNA BUY
  IS A LAFFY TAFFY, THAT'S IT.

            - YEAH?
           OKAY, AND
      WHAT ABOUT YOU, JOE?
        - I'D GO A DIME.

   HE LIKES TO BE IN CONTROL
       LIKE THAT AND UH,
       GETS INTO IT, SO--

    - NOW YOU SMILED AT BOTH
  THOSE PHRASES THAT YOU SAID.
      - SO YOU LIKE THAT?
         - I DO. I DO.
    HE'S A MAN. I LIKE THAT.

  - AND WHAT DID YOU SAY, JOE?
         - TOTAL ALPHA.
             YEAH.

    NICOLE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
  - ALTHOUGH HE IS EXTREMELY,
        UM, AGGRESSIVE,
        HE'S ALSO A HUGE
       LOVE-BUG LAP DOG,

     SO WHEN HE COMES HOME,
            HE LIKES
    TO BE PET APPROPRIATELY.
             - AH.

     ALL RIGHT, WELL, BRAD,
       WHAT DID YOU SAY?
            LAP DOG.
      BUT I HAVE A FEELING
          THAT AT HOME

          THERE'S SOME
     ALPHA CHARACTERISTICS.
          - OH, SURE.
           - YOU CAN
     PET HIM FOR A MINUTE,

     BUT YOU GOTTA GIVE 'EM
          A GOOD BONE
     AND SEE WHAT THEY DO.
           - SHERRI.
           - MM-HMM.

   ALL RIGHT. NEXT QUESTION.
  LADIES, HOW DID YOU HUSBAND
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE:
    SOMETIMES I WISH MY WIFE
       PUT AS MUCH ENERGY

   TOWARDS OUR BEDROOM ANTICS
   AS SHE PUTS TOWARDS BLANK.
             JULIE?
   - UM, I GUESS I WOULD HAVE
    TO SAY, UH, MY TEACHING.

    - JOE, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
     - I SAID HER TEACHING.
         - HER CAREER?
          - TEACHING.
        - THAT'S RIGHT.

            - YEAH.
   - WHAT ABOUT YOU, NICOLE?
      - UM, WELL, I SPEND
         A LOT OF TIME

     TAKING CARE OF OUR TWO
    LITTLE FURRY KIDS, SO...

           - I--KIDS.
       - OKAY, I GOT IT.

      - SO, I'M GONNA SAY
 HE IS GONNA GO WITH THE CATS.
   - BRAD, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
         - THE KITTENS.

       SO, YOUR TWO KIDS.
    'CAUSE I KNOW HOW PEOPLE
      ARE WITH THEIR CATS,
      WITH THEIR TWO KIDS.

    ARE THEY IN THE BEDROOM
     WITH YOU WHEN YOU'RE--
   THEY'RE NOT IN THE BEDROOM
           WITH YOU?
           - OH, NO.
     - THERE SHOULD ONLY BE

   ONE KITTY-CAT IN THAT ROOM
     WITH YOU AND YOUR MAN.
           ONLY ONE.
      ALL RIGHT, DARSHELL,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?

     - I WOULD HAVE TO SAY
           SHOPPING.
     THAT'S THE ONLY THING
       THAT I LIKE TO DO
    MORE THAN HAVE WHOOPIE.

     - SO YOU HAVE WHOOPIE,
    YOU DON'T MAKE WHOOPIE.
       YOU JUST SIT BACK
   AND YOU HAVE WHOOPIE, HUH?
          - SOMETIMES.
       - ALL RIGHT, GIRL.

        - SO, SHOPPING.
    YOU LIKE SHOPPING A LOT.

            A PENNY
          FOR EACH GUY
   HE THOUGHT YOU SLEPT WITH,

   HOW MUCH MONEY WOULD HE BE
       HOLDING RIGHT NOW?
   NICOLE, YOU LOOK WORRIED.
      WHAT'S THAT LOOK ON
        YOUR FACE, GIRL?

 - I DON'T KNOW WHAT HE THINKS,
      I'M GONNA SAY FIVE.
            - OKAY.
      WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

       HE SAID 15 CENTS.
      THAT MADE YOU LAUGH.
  COULD THAT POSSIBLY BE TR--?
       - THAT'S PROBABLY
      CLOSER TO ACCURATE.

             - OH.
            MM-HMM.
      ALL RIGHT, DARSHELL,
        WHAT ABOUT YOU?
   - I WOULD SAY FIVE CENTS.
       - FIVE CENTS? WHY?

  - 'CAUSE THAT'S ABOUT RIGHT.
   - LET'S SEE WHAT SHE SAID,
    DORIEN. THAT'S CORRECT.
          - YAY. YES.

       - LOOK AT DORIEN.
    A NICKEL WORTH OF NOOKY.
          LOOK AT YOU.
  OKAY. JULIE, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

      - UH, I'M GONNA HAVE
          TO SAY SIX,
 JUST BECAUSE I THINK HE WOULD
     SAY MAYBE FIVE, BUT--
  JUST GIVE A LITTLE EXTRA ONE
        THERE, SO, UH...

 I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.
 YOU THINK THAT HE'D SAY FIVE,
  BUT YOU'RE GONNA PUT IN A--
     YOU'RE GONNA THROW IN
         AN EXTRA ONE.

     - YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.
    - I'M JUST FEELING GOOD,
I'LL JUST THROW IN ANOTHER ONE.
 - THROW ANOTHER ONE IN THERE.
            - OKAY.

    - I THREW IN A FEW MORE.
      - HE SAID TEN CENTS.
       - I JUST GUESSED.
        I JUST GUESSED.
      - I WOULD LOVE TO BE
   IN THE CRACKS AND CREVICES

         OF YOUR MIND,
       BOTH OF YOU GUYS.

    - OH. OKAY, WELL, SORRY.
    WE'VE GOT A LOT OF TIME
    TO GET THIS OUT OF YOU.
   ALL RIGHT, NEXT QUESTION.

       LADIES, IF YOU HAD
        TO TAKE A GUESS,
      WHAT WOULD YOU THINK
   WAS THE BIGGEST COMPLAINT
      YOUR HUSBAND'S LAST
  EX-GIRLFRIEND HAD ABOUT HIM?

             JULIE?
      - UM, SHE WOULD SAY
   THAT HE PARTIES TOO MUCH.
             - OH.

        - UH, WE DO LIKE
        TO GO HAVE FUN.
   BUT I THINK AT THAT POINT
      IN HIS LIFE HE WAS,
    YOU KNOW, GOING OUT AND,
           YOU KNOW,

  BEING CRAZY LIKE YOU SHOULD
          AT THAT AGE.
       - GOT YOU. NICOLE?
   - MY HUSBAND I DON'T THINK
     HAS CHANGED THAT MUCH

        IN HIS DEMEANOR
      THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE
    AND HE ASKS A TREMENDOUS
      AMOUNT OF QUESTIONS,
      SO I'M PROBABLY JUST
       GONNA STICK WITH,

         UH, HIM ASKING
      A LOT OF QUESTIONS.
  - DARSHELL, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
 - UH, I WOULD SAY THAT DORIEN

        USED TO BE SORT
     OF LIKE A LADIES' MAN.
         SO I WOULD SAY
        TOO MANY WOMEN.
       - TOO MANY WOMEN?
     - YEAH, JUST A LITTLE.

       - AND HE HAS GOT--
     THAT IS OUT THE DOOR?
   - OH, YEAH. I TAMED THAT.
        - OKAY, GOT YOU.
       ALL RIGHT, LADIES,
    COMPLETE THIS SENTENCE:

      THE FIRST TIME I SAW
  MY HUSBAND COMPLETELY NAKED,
      MY EYES IMMEDIATELY
     FOCUSED ON HIS BLANK.
 LET'S HAVE FUN WITH THIS ONE.
            NICOLE.

          - OH, YEAH,
       IT'S THE PACKAGE.
    - YOU WEREN'T SURPRISED
  OR ANYTHING. WAS IT JUST--?
           - OH, NO.
  I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.

             - AH.

     A GIFT, YOU OPEN IT UP
AND IT'S EVERYTHING YOU THOUGHT
     AND EVEN MORE, RIGHT?

        WITH HER AND SAY
       THE PACKAGE ALSO.

            - YEAH?
            - YEAH.
   BECAUSE WHEN I MET DORIEN
       HE WAS SO SKINNY,
      SO I WAS SURPRISED.

         - SO YOU--OH.
        - YOURS WAS LIKE
     WHEN YOU TAKE A DRESS
    IN THE ROOM, AND YOU'RE,

   AND WHAT ABOUT YOU, JULIE?

  - I'M DEFINITELY GONNA HAVE
    TO AGREE WITH THE LADIES

      ON THE SHORTER SIDE,
         SO, YOU KNOW,
  WHEN HE REVEALED EVERYTHING,
   I WAS SHOCKINGLY SURPRISED
        IN A GREAT WAY.

      AND I WAS THINKING,
   "HOW IS THIS GONNA WORK?"
     - WHAT? WAS HE TALLER
       THAN YOU EXPECTED?
          - OH, YEAH.
             - OH.

     15 POINTS. HERE WE GO.

    FOR ME, A PERFECT SUNDAY
     HAS TO INCLUDE BLANK,
     WHILE FOR MY HUSBAND,

  IT DEFINITELY HAS TO INVOLVE
        BLANK. DARSHELL?
 - I WOULD SAY A PERFECT SUNDAY
   WOULD HAVE TO INCLUDE SEX,
     AND FOR HIM, IT WOULD
    DEFINITELY BE FOOTBALL.

  - SO FOR YOU, SEX. FOR YOUR
HUSBAND, IT'S GOTTA BE FOOTBALL.
   - YES. I HAVE TO BE QUIET
  UNTIL THE FOOTBALL GOES OFF
     AND THEN IT'S MY TIME.

       - GOT YOU. JULIE?
   - UH, I WOULD SAY FOR ME,
        A PERFECT SUNDAY
       WOULD BE TO READ.

I'M A BOOKWORM. I LOVE TO READ.
      SO I WOULD DO THAT.
   HIM. DEFINITELY FOOTBALL.
         HE'S IN, LIKE,
     8,000 FANTASY LEAGUES
