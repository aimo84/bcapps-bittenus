EDIT: I'm guessing the OP has long since solved the problem, but here
are some additional thoughts, purely for verbosity reasons.

I confirmed the overlays occur at zoom level 11, but not at zoom level 10. More specifically:

  - https://s1-vodafone.cloud.eaglegis.co.nz/arcgis/rest/services/coverage-maps/Mobile_3G_0_T_FF5400/MapServer/tile/11/1282/2018 yields an error, even though its in central Wellington, a large New Zealand city.

  - https://s1-vodafone.cloud.eaglegis.co.nz/arcgis/rest/services/coverage-maps/Mobile_3G_0_T_FF5400/MapServer/tile/10/641/1009 however, exists, and, as expected, looks quite full:

https://s1-vodafone.cloud.eaglegis.co.nz/arcgis/rest/services/coverage-maps/Mobile_3G_0_T_FF5400/MapServer/tile/10/641/1009

  - Since we want the most detail, we will use zoom level 10, and now
  need to find the x and y ranges.

  - Assuming that we're only concerned with "mainland" New Zealand
  (the two big islands and any nearby offshore islands), and not in
  the absolute extrema points mentioned at
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_New_Zealand#New_Zealand_overall
  (all of which are on smaller and fairly distant islands), we use
  http://test.barrycarter.info/gettile.php to find:

    - The easternmost zoom 10 tiles are near the aptly titled "East Cape" with an x value of 1019:

    - The westernmost zoom 10 tiles are near the not-quite-so-aptly
    named South Island, with an x value of 985.

    - The southernmost zoom 10 tiles are near the aptly-titled Big
    South Cape Island with a y value of 665:

[[12.png]]

    - Finally, the northermost zoom 10 tiles are on Three Kings'
    Island (google won't show the name unless you zoom in one level
    deeper though) with a y value of 615:

[[13.png]]

  - Thus, we need to download all tiles where x is between 985 and
  1019 (inclusive) and y is between 615 and 665 (inclusive) for a
  total of 35*51 or 1785 tiles.

  - The Perl script below will do this for you (when piped to sh):

perl -le 'for $x (985..1019) {for $y (615..665) {print "curl -o 10,$x,$y.png https://s1-vodafone.cloud.eaglegis.co.nz/arcgis/rest/services/coverage-maps/Mobile_3G_0_T_FF5400/MapServer/tile/10/$y/$x"}}'

Notice that vodafone uses /$y/$x in that order, instead of the more
normal /$x/$y order.

  - Note that many of these PNG files are blank, and it turns out that
  Vodafone stops at y=664 (which is reasonable, since only a small
  portion of "mainland" New Zealand reaches into y=665), so the y=665
  files will all be HTML files saying "not found".

  - If you'd prefer not to download the files yourself, I've
  downloaded and zipped them at:
  https://www.dropbox.com/s/9nqhp6caqkxcxf0/20161120.zip?dl=0

  - I didn't check carefully, but the resulting images appear to have
  4 colors:

    - #000000 (black): no coverage

    - #88e200 (shade of dark orange): poor signal

    - #af3b00 (different shade of dark orange): medium signal

    - #c74200 (strong orange): good signal

(color descriptions courtesy http://www.colorhexa.com/)

  - The next is to convert each pixel to a latitude/longitude area,
  which I do in the "slippy2latlon" subroutine in
  https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/bclib.pl

  - Note from the extrema images above, each individual gridbox is
  less than 20.14 miles wide. Since there are 256 pixels to a gridbox,
  the resolution is 20.14/256*5280 or about 415 feet per pixel.
