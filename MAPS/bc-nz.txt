EDIT: I'm guessing the OP has long since solved the problem, but here
are some additional thoughts, purely for verbosity reasons.

I confirmed the overlays occur at zoom level 11, but not at zoom level 10. More specifically:

  - https://s1-vodafone.cloud.eaglegis.co.nz/arcgis/rest/services/coverage-maps/Mobile_3G_0_T_FF5400/MapServer/tile/11/1282/2018 yields an error, even though its in central Wellington, a large New Zealand city.

  - https://s1-vodafone.cloud.eaglegis.co.nz/arcgis/rest/services/coverage-maps/Mobile_3G_0_T_FF5400/MapServer/tile/10/641/1009 however, exists, and, as expected, looks quite full:

  - Assuming we want the most detail, we will use zoom level 10, but
  still need to find the x and y ranges.

  - Using my http://test.barrycarter.info/gettile.php, we see the
  easternmost level 10 tile is the Chatham/Pitt Island area with an x
  value of 1034.

  - The westernmost zoom 10 tile is on Auckland Island with an x value (at zoom level 10) of 983.

  - The southernmost zoom 10 tile is on Campbell Island (actually it's
  the little island to the south of Campbell Island, known as
  Jacquemart Island, but it's in the same zoom 10 tile) with a y value
  of 688:

  - Finally, the northermost zoom 10 tile is 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_New_Zealand says westernmost is Cape Lovitt but no

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_extreme_points_of_New_Zealand

we find the southernmost and westernmost zoom level 10 tiles for New Zealand are on 


x=983, y=680 is the SW most at zoom=10

y=616 (and x=1003) at zoom 10 is northernmost

prob not on auckland island, but

x=1019 = easternmost (y=627)

so xrnage: 983-1019
yrange: 616-680

so: 37 times 65 = 2405 images

notice y x reversal
