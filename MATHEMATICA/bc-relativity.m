(*

Simple relativity:

A shoots light at B, 1 light second away moving at .9c

A sees light reach B at 10s, 10ls away

B sees light at 2s, 1.9ls away

Thus, A to B transform is:

{10, 10} -> {1.9, 2}

(* the Loretnz contraction, v as fraction of light speed *)

Sqrt[1-v^2]

(* time dilation *)

1/Sqrt[1-v^2]
