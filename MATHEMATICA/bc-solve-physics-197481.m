This is an interesting question. I've previously computed planetary
conjunctions *as viewed from Earth*:
https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/11141 but not as viewed
from the Sun, or from an observer looking down at the solar system and
looking for straightish lines.

It turns out this is much easier to compute, since the planets follow
nearly circular orbits around the Sun.

TODO: note significantly more accurate calculations with CSPICE
