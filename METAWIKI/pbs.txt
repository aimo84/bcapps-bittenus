Pearls Before Swine tests (pretty much redoing this to be specific to PeBeSw)

Guidelines for editing this file:

  - Character names are given as "name (species)", eg "Leah (zebra)",
  without any relations (eg, not "Aunt Leah").

  - Exceptions: Well-known characters use just their first names (like
  "Larry") with a separate species indicator (eg,
  "Larry::species::crocodile")

  - If two characters have both the same name and species (eg, the
  crocodiles named Bob), this is given as "Bob 20101015 (crocodile)"
  where 2010-10-15 is the date they first appeared. I'm not crazy
  about this convention, but it beats "Bob 2 (crocodile)" because I'd
  have to update the order every time I found a new Bob between two
  existing Bobs. I may have the program simply re-name these in order
  when found.

  - If a character is referred to by reference (eg, "Neighbor Joe"),
  the name is still Joe, with "Rat+Pig::neighbor::Joe (human)" for
  example. Additionally, "Joe (human)::aka::Neighbor Joe".

  - If the character name indicates a profession (eg, "Cobbler Bob"),
  you can also add "Bob (human)::profession::cobbler".

  - for _deaths keys, use "#4" to indicate 4 deaths above and beyond
  named character deaths (can't use "+" because that already means two
  or more keys/values)

  - use &#58; for colons in text

TODO:

  - handle MULTIREF pages

  - Pig + Rat's human neighbors automatically "::aka::Neighbor x"

  - removing _deaths count where species of death is already given,
  tweak program to fix

MULTIREF [[title::Pig's Cheese Fetish]] [[notes::Pig seems to have an unusual obsession with cheese. On [[2002-05-25]], he describes heaven as "finding a cheese basket on your doorstep. On [[2003-10-31]], one of his charades guesses is cheese (another guess, "monkey", also appears to be an object of fascination for Pig). On [[2004-05-07]], he refers to (and is fascinated by) a grater as "cheese grater" (even though it can grate many other things). On [[2007-05-23]], he invents "cheese sneakers". On [[2009-01-07]], Rat designs a building made of cheese (which Pig says could be "hard to build"), an indirect reference.  On [[2010-08-07]], he (and Rat) are obsessed with free cheese samples. On [[2011-05-02]], Pig describes his cheese's expiration date as an "event". On [[2012-05-11]], we learn that Pig visit a speciality cheese store (possible nod to Monty Python here). On [[2012-06-18]], Pig obtains a new grater, which he again uses to grate (shred) some cheese. On [[2013-03-06]], we learn that Pig regularly eats fried cheese sticks, cheeseburgers, and chili cheese fries. On [[2014-04-07]], he tells Pigita he prefers eating cheese over shelter.]]

Not suitable for some readers who prefer 75 year-old strips drawn by the son of the son of the son of the original creator. Product not available in some cities where `Snuffy Smith' still wins reader polls. Product may have limited availability in cities where editors choose comic strips based solely upon potential social or demographic appeal. Check local listings. No animals were harmed in the making of this strip, although we roughed up the dumb pig a little bit. Our apologies to the editors throughout North America who are staying up late tonight perusing this text with a magnifying glass to ensure that this cartoonist did not bury any offending words or concepts in this text. Okay... I'm tired now. To be perfectly frank, when I initially came up with this `tiny word' joke, I thought it would be really quick to do, but I now see that to make this joke work, the writing has to be really small, and it takes a ton of tiny words to fill such a large space. Hence, I have run out of ideas. If you'd like, you can now move on to `Cathy' or `B.C.'And check in on their crazy antics, as I am totally out of funny stuff. Actually, so are they. So heck, maybe you ought to put this newspaper down and watch a little TV. Geez, man, I STILL have more space to fill with this now tired joke. What to do... what to do... I suppose that a lesser cartoonist would use this space to promote his latest books, but I don't think that either of my two books, `BLTs taste so darn good' or `This little piggy stayed home', both pf which were published by Andrews McMeel publishing need that sort of cheap publicity. Their sales at Borders, Barnes & Nobles, Amazon.com and your local bookstore have been tremendous and they don't need more help from me here. Wow, finally... I'm done. I'm never doing this joke again"]]

And the label is pretty great too. And it comes in those handy little cardboard six-packs that have those little handles on them that make the beer easier to carry around. And if you buy the beer, you'll probably make more friends because that's just the kind of beer it is. So that's about all I have to say about Danny Donkey beer, except for the fact that it goes really good with chips, pretzels, crackers, cheese, pizza, burritos, tacos, pasta, hamburgers, and hot dogs. I really like hot dogs. It also goes really well with my friend Stephan's blog. You should read it. It's at www.stephanpastis.wordpress.com. Or even better, go be one of his friends on Facebook. His Facebook page is http://www.facebook.com/pages/Stephan-Pastis/132583843763?created. Stephan's a pretty good guy. I'd promote his books too, but I'm probably getting pretty far from my original topic, that being Danny Donkey beer, which tastes really great and is less filling. So if you want to be[COVERED] and have lots of friends and have all the girls like you, drink Da[COVERED]and you'll never regret it. Take care and have a nice day [COVERED] driving on this fine morning, or afternoon, or night, or [COVERED] maybe."]]

MULTIREF [[title::Lemmings Leap]] [[notes::On [[2012-10-19]] (also [[noref::2013-02-19]], [[noref::2013-06-09]], [[noref::2014-03-05]], and [[noref::2014-03-17]]), there is no sign next to [[location::Lemmings Leap]].  On [[2012-10-20]] the sign reads "LEMMING LEAP". On [[2013-08-05]], it reads the same, but the lettering is now red. By [[2012-10-23]], it's changed to "Lemming's Leap" (which implies it belongs to a single lemming). On [[2012-10-26]] (also [[noref::2014-04-16]]), it's "Lemming Leap" (no apostrophe). On [[2013-02-05]] (also [[noref::2013-02-21]], [[noref::2013-06-03]], [[noref::2013-06-08]], and [[noref::2013-07-19]]) it's "LEMMINGS' LEAP" (implying belongs to many lemmings). On [[2013-02-07]], it's "Lemmings' LEAP" (first word in lower-case). The wording is the same on [[2014-03-07]], but the sign now also has a skull and crossbones. On [[2013-07-09]] it's "LEMMINGS' Leap" (second word in lower-case). On [[2013-12-14]], it's "Lemmings LEAP" (plural without apostrophe)]]

On [[2008-05-09]], Rat sends Pig a telegram via monkey (again somewhat coincidental, though possibly Rat's attempt to scare Pig). On [[2009-06-30]], Pig wears monkey underwear (the monkey looks curiously like {{wp|Curious George}}).
