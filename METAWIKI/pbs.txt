Pearls Before Swine tests (pretty much redoing this to be specific to PeBeSw)

Guidelines for editing this file:

  - Character names are given as "name (species)", eg "Leah (zebra)",
  without any relations (eg, not "Aunt Leah").

  - Exceptions: Well-known characters use just their first names (like
  "Larry") with a separate species indicator (eg,
  "Larry::species::crocodile")

  - If two characters have both the same name and species (eg, the
  crocodiles named Bob), this is given as "Bob 20101015 (crocodile)"
  where 2010-10-15 is the date they first appeared. I'm not crazy
  about this convention, but it beats "Bob 2 (crocodile)" because I'd
  have to update the order every time I found a new Bob between two
  existing Bobs. I may have the program simply re-name these in order
  when found.

  - If a character is referred to by reference (eg, "Neighbor Joe"),
  the name is still Joe, with "Rat+Pig::neighbor::Joe (human)" for
  example. Additionally, "Joe (human)::aka::Neighbor Joe".

  - If the character name indicates a profession (eg, "Cobbler Bob"),
  you can also add "Bob (human)::profession::cobbler".

  - use &#58; for colons in text

TODO:

  - handle MULTIREF pages

  - Pig + Rat's human neighbors automatically "::aka::Neighbor x"

  - removing _deaths count where species of death is already given,
  tweak program to fix

2004-09-20 [[notes::The disclaimer text reads "Pearls Before Swine. Copyright 2004 by Stephan T. Pastis. Distributed by United Feature Syndicate. Laughter not guaranteed. Not suitable for some readers who prefer 75 year-old strips drawn by the son of the son of the son of the original creator. Product not available in some cities where `Snuffy Smith' still wins reader polls. Product may have limited availability in cities where editors choose comic strips based solely upon potential social or demographic appeal. Check local listings. No animals were harmed in the making of this strip, although we roughed up the dumb pig a little bit. Our apologies to the editors throughout North America who are staying up late tonight perusing this text with a magnifying glass to ensure that this cartoonist did not bury any offending words or concepts in this text. Okay... I'm tired now. To be perfectly frank, when I initially came up with this `tiny word' joke, I thought it would be really quick to do, but I now see that to make this joke work, the writing has to be really small, and it takes a ton of tiny words to fill such a large space. Hence, I have run out of ideas. If you'd like, you can now move on to `Cathy' or `B.C.'And check in on their crazy antics, as I am totally out of funny stuff. Actually, so are they. So heck, maybe you ought to put this newspaper down and watch a little TV. Geez, man, I STILL have more space to fill with this now tired joke. What to do... what to do... I suppose that a lesser cartoonist would use this space to promote his latest books, but I don't think that either of my two books, `BLTs taste so darn good' or `This little piggy stayed home', both pf which were published by Andrews McMeel publishing need that sort of cheap publicity. Their sales at Borders, Barnes & Nobles, Amazon.com and your local bookstore have been tremendous and they don't need more help from me here. Wow, finally... I'm done. I'm never doing this joke again"]]
