Goal: Setup a version of nagios that uses my programs to handle alerts, 
fixes, etc. Run as:

sudo rm ~/ERR/nagios.*.err;
sudo pkill nagios; sudo nagios ~/BCGIT/NAGIOS/nagios.cfg &

Also attempts to "fix" what I percieve as design flaws in nagios

To force nagios to run a command instantly, see http://old.nagios.org/developerinfo/externalcommands/commandlist.php (examples below)

echo "["`date +%s`"]" "SCHEDULE_FORCED_HOST_CHECK;bcmac;"`date +%s` >> /var/nagios/rw/nagios.cmd

echo "["`date +%s`"]" "SCHEDULE_FORCED_HOST_SVC_CHECKS;localhost;"`date +%s` >> /var/nagios/rw/nagios.cmd

Created these views solely to avoid quoting problems in 'badbank' test

CREATE VIEW badbank AS SELECT * FROM bankstatements WHERE
(recognized IS NULL OR recognized!='YES') AND amount<0 AND date>='2013-07-01';

CREATE VIEW badbankcat AS SELECT * FROM bankstatements WHERE
 (category IS NULL OR category="") AND amount<0 AND date>="2013-09-01";
