nagios tests I need to add:

  - disk full tests (perhaps collectively) for all drives, not just root drive

  - confirm ~/my-tumblr-blogs.txt contains no repeats

  - check size of idrive backups comparing
  /mnt/villa/massbacks-idrive-saopaulo/*.list (the size of the .1 file
  is mentioned here) to the actual sizes from bc-idrive.pl

  - grep -L '^2029' ~/annoytab.d/*.txt should show all automated
  events (except leap day, arg!) go through at least 2029 (at which
  point I have a meta-event to update further, in the highly unlikely
  event I am still alive)

  - above MAY apply to ~/calendar.d/*.txt as well, but may not

  - make sure local weather on bc-bg is not too old

  - CCPAY and PAYMENT should be in right tables [this item makes sense
  only to me]

  - confirm that orders from mario's and walmart, etc, have order
  numbers, times, and other information I sometimes forget to enter
