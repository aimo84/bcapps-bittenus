This is "nagyerass take two", a replacement for nagios, after I've
used nagios for a while and understand what I dislike about it.

bc-run-nya-test.pl: This program will do the following:

  - log that a test is about to be run

  - run a test that is either a raw Unix command (including possibly a
  test that's part of the nagios suite) or a subroutine found in
  bc-run-nya-test.pl itself

  - a test may contain subtests, which will be run as separate forked processes

  - log the results of the test

  - print to ~/ERR the results of the test









TODO: test may contain subtests
