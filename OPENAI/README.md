This is just a cut and paste of prompts I gave to https://beta.openai.com/playground and the responses. I was posting these on reddit at https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/zd6wxq/my_tests/ but feel that's getting too spammy even though I am filtering (too many good ones).

Write a dark time travel story

Rudy had heard the stories of time travel but never believed that it was possible, until one day he found himself in a mysterious lab with a strange looking machine. After hours of tinkering, he managed to get the machine to work, and before he knew it, he was in a dark, unfamiliar place. 

He soon realized that he had traveled to the future, and the world he found himself in was much darker than he had ever imagined. The sky was a murky gray and the people looked haggard and depressed. In the distance, Rudy could see smoke rising from the ruins of a once great city. 

He began to explore, but soon found himself in a dire situation. Everywhere he went, he encountered people that were hostile and aggressive. He was chased, threatened, and even attacked. 

After days of wandering, Rudy stumbled upon a group of people that welcomed him into their fold. They explained that they were the last remnants of humanity, living in the shadows of a nuclear holocaust. They had scoured the earth for any survivors, but it seemed that Rudy was the only one left. 

The group offered Rudy a way out; they had a time machine that would take him back to his own time. Rudy was hesitant, but with no other option, he reluctantly agreed. 

Back in his own time, Rudy was filled with a profound sadness. He had seen firsthand the darkness that awaited mankind, and he was filled with a heavy heart. He had been given a glimpse into the future, and it was a future he desperately wanted to avoid. 

Rudy now dedicated his life to preventing the dark future he had seen. He worked tirelessly to spread awareness and to make sure that the future he had seen never came to pass. He knew that if he failed, the darkness of the future would consume the world.

Write a dark time travel story with an ironic twist


The sun had set long ago, and the darkness of the night was all-encompassing. I felt like a child again, standing in the middle of the empty street, all alone. I could feel a chill in the air, and I knew something was coming.

I had decided to try time travel, a feat I had read of in books and seen in movies. I had made a makeshift time machine, a contraption that I had cobbled together with whatever I had at my disposal. I had no idea if it would work, but I had to try.

I closed my eyes and pressed the button. Instantly, I felt a strange sensation, as if I was being pulled in two different directions. When I opened my eyes again, I was no longer in my neighborhood. I was in an unfamiliar place that looked like something out of a nightmare.

The streets were filled with the dead, their bodies strewn about in various positions. Everywhere I looked, I saw the bodies of people who had died in a war long forgotten. I felt a deep sadness and regret for what had happened to them.

Finally, I saw a figure in the distance. It was a woman, and she seemed to be beckoning me. I followed her, and as I got closer I realized that she was dressed in a long dress from the 1800s. I had traveled back in time to a time before the war.

The woman told me that she was a witch, and that she had been expecting me. She said that I had been sent back to make a difference, to change the course of history and prevent the war that had taken so many lives.

At first, I was shocked, but then I realized the irony of the situation. I was the one who had caused the war in the first place. I had created the time machine and had gone back in time to prevent something that I had already caused.

The witch said that I could still make a difference, that I could still save the future. I felt a new sense of purpose, and I knew that I had to do whatever I could to change the course of history.

I went back to the present, determined to make a difference. I worked hard to ensure that the events of the past would never repeat themselves. I dedicated my life to making sure that no one ever had to experience such a terrible tragedy again.

In the end, I succeeded. I changed the course of history, and the war that had once seemed inevitable did not come to pass. It was ironic, but I had managed to save the future by traveling back in time.

Write a creepypasta about time travel

It all began with a simple experiment. A group of scientists, known as the Temporals, had designed a machine that could take them back in time. They were certain that the experiment would be successful, and were happy to be on the cusp of a new discovery.

The first trial went off without a hitch. The machine worked and the Temporals were able to travel back in time to a few days prior. They were elated, and decided to take the machine even further back in time.

The second trial proved to be a disaster. Instead of going back a few days, the machine took them back millions of years. The scientists were horrified to find themselves in an unfamiliar time and place, filled with strange creatures and landscapes.

As the Temporals tentatively explored their new surroundings, they soon realized the danger they were in. Not only were the creatures of the past hostile and unpredictable, but the Temporals had no way of getting back to the present.

The Temporals were stuck in the past, unable to return home. After a few days of trying every possible solution, they realized that their only hope was to find a way to go forward in time.

The Temporals eventually discovered how to manipulate the machine to take them forward in time. They were able to find their way back to the present, but the experience had taken its toll on all of them.

They returned, but something had changed. The Temporals found that they had developed a strange ability to foresee the future. It seemed that the experience of travelling through time had altered their minds in a profound way, and now they could see the future as if it were the present.

The Temporals were never able to replicate the experiment. They had stumbled upon a phenomenon that could not be explained, and the secrets of time travel were lost to them forever.

Write a song to the tune of Mary Had a Little Lamb about slaughterhouses

Mary had a little lamb,
It's life was soon to end,
The farmer sent it to the slaughterhouse,
Where the animals all meet their fate.

The lamb was filled with fear and dread,
As it heard the others scream and bled,
It knew it's final fate was near,
For it's life would soon be sealed.

The workers had no thought or care,
For the lamb that was so scared and scared,
They grabbed it by it's little neck,
And to the killing floor it went.

The lamb was all alone and afraid,
It knew it's life was soon to fade,
It's little heart was filled with dread,
For it knew it's life was done.

The workers had no thought or care,
For the lamb that was so scared and scared,
They grabbed it by it's little neck,
And to the killing floor it went.

Mary had a little lamb,
It's life was soon to end,
But it won't be forgotten,
For it's death will stand as a reminder.

Write an episode where Mr Green Jeans goes postal

Mr. Green Jeans had been having a rough month. His usual tranquil garden had been taken over by a group of loud and obnoxious teenagers who were determined to make a name for themselves.

He had tried to talk to them, but they just laughed and mocked him. He had even called the police, but they had done nothing.

Finally, he had had enough. He had gone to the post office and bought a large package of letters. He was going to send them to the teenagers' homes and let them know he was not going to take their behavior any longer.

He filled out the forms and addressed the letters with their names and addresses. He then mailed them off with a passionate letter inside.

The next day, the teenagers received their letters in the mail. They were all surprised and scared by the content of the letters. They had no idea who sent them, but they knew it was serious.

The following day, the teenagers stayed away from Mr. Green Jeans' garden. They had learned their lesson.

Mr. Green Jeans had gone postal and it had worked!
