This doesn't answer your question and may not even be accurate, but
here's some starter code, if we assume that a "vertex" in your graph
is a "node shared by at least two ways" (which means dead ends/cul de
sacs are NOT considered vertexes).

To convert OSM data to a trivial undirected G(V,E) graph (no edge
lengths, no names, etc):

  - Find which nodes appear in more than one way:

bzfgrep 'nd ref' albuquerque_new-mexico.osm.bz2|sort|uniq -d>multinodes.txt

  - Create a file that contains the above PLUS the string "<way". One
  way (ha ha) to do this:

echo "<way" >> multinodes.txt

  - Find the ways that have these repeated nodes:

bzfgrep -f multinodes.txt albuquerque_new-mexico.osm.bz2 > multinodes2.txt

  - And how they connect:

perl -ne 'chomp; if (/<way/) {print "\n"; next} else {/ref="(\d+)"/; print "$1 "}' multinodes2.txt > multinodes3.txt

  - Each line now shows a list of pairwise connected vertexes.

   - NOTE: Lines with a single vertex represent nodes that connect to
   dead ends. You can probably ignore them.

I'm bored and would be happy to do this (and perhaps a bit more) for
free for any city in https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts

Adding many data to openstreetmap.org

This projects aims to add all Albuquerque street addresses (and later
businesses) to OSM. It is NOT really part of the City of Albuquerque's
open data initiative (http://cabq.gov/abq-data), but the data I use is
also available there now (it's been available for years, but was
harder to find).

Changeset 12068601 was my attempt to upload 45K addresses at a time;
this failed, as did my attempt to upload 5K addresses at a time, so
this changeset somehow ended up with 3839 nodes. I plan to update
bc-parse-addr.pl to ignore these nodes (alternate plan was to delete +
re-add, but that seems excessive)

Changeset 12101666 was another screw-up: I had the program uploading
500 at a time, but accidentally did "curl &" instead of "curl", so had
100+ curl processes running parallel.

After that settles, I'll re-dl ABQ city data, so I won't duplicate
anything I already added.

Here's what I did with the output of bc-biz2ll.pl (ie,
data/businessaddresses.txt):

bzcat ../db/abqaddr.bz2|perl -pnle 's/\|/ /isg;' > /var/tmp/addr-with-space.txt
fgrep --color=always -if data/businessaddresses.txt /var/tmp/addr-with-space.txt > data/bizll.txt

This gives me latitude/longitude for ABQ businesses (roughly). Adding
coloring will let me snip out the exact address from the line.

note: test4.txt is the working version
