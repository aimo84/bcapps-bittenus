The list of quora topics is current as of ~ 16 May 2016 1700 UTC.

The list of quora users was obtained 26 Jun 2016 and contains just
over 1.4 million users, but is highly incomplete, and doesn't even
include me. Please contact me if you can help. The format of this file:

username full name

The username will never contain spaces. To visit a person's profile,
browse to "https://www.quora.com/profile/username".

NOTE: Some files in this directory are bzip2'd to save space; in most
cases, you must bunzip2 them to actually use them. In particular,
there is no easy way to use SQLite3 databases when they are bzip2'd
compressed (I believe it's not truly impossible, but would require
some clever coding)

Schema for blockgroups SQLite3 table:

CREATE TABLE blockgroups (
 geoid text, statefp INT, aland DOUBLE, awater DOUBLE,
 intptlat DOUBLE, intptlon DOUBLE, population INT
);

.separator ,
.import /tmp/blockgroups.txt blockgroups
