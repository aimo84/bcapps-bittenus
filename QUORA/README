The list of quora topics is current as of ~ 16 May 2016 1700 UTC.

The list of quora users was obtained 26 Jun 2016, contains 2,859,092
users, and should be nearly complete. Because the profile listings
page change dynamically, however, it may not be 100% complete. Format:

page username full/display name

page: the page number on which this user was found:

  - Example: users on
  https://www.quora.com/sitemap/people?page_id=6812 would have page
  set to 6812

  - New users appear to be on page 1.

  - https://www.quora.com/sitemap/people?page_id=14703 shows no
  further page links, so the 14703 pages I scraped appear to be
  complete

  - Some pages, like
  https://www.quora.com/sitemap/people?page_id=12665, list only one
  user (the others may have been deleted), so it's not always 200
  users per page

username: the person's username; this will never contain spaces; to visit this person's profile, https://www.quora.com/profile/username

full/display name: the person's full or display name; this may contain spaces

NOTE: Some files in this directory are bzip2'd to save space; in most
cases, you must bunzip2 them to actually use them. In particular,
there is no easy way to use SQLite3 databases when they are bzip2'd
compressed (I believe it's not truly impossible, but would require
some clever coding)

Schema for blockgroups SQLite3 table:

CREATE TABLE blockgroups (
 geoid text, statefp INT, aland DOUBLE, awater DOUBLE,
 intptlat DOUBLE, intptlon DOUBLE, population INT
);

.separator ,
.import /tmp/blockgroups.txt blockgroups
