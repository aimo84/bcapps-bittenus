QUORA SCRAPING TIPS
===================

Running bc-get-logs.pl and doing "parallel -j 10 < cmds.sh" does a
reasonably good job of dl'ing quora logs (about 1000/minute), but has
some errors. To find those errors:

: files sized 2713c are almost always "Quora is temporarily unavailable."
find . -size 2713c > /tmp/2713c.txt &

: files sized 2843c are almost always
: "You don't have permission to view this page."
: this step may be inefficient since the next steps would catch this anyway
find . -maxdepth 1 -size 2843c >! 2843c.txt &

: NOTE: do steps above first so I'm not pointlessly grepping into bad files

: makes things easier, maybe
: -maxdepth 1 here assumes all quora logs in subdirs have already been
: checked which isn't actually true
find . -maxdepth 1 -type f >! fileshere.txt &

: MAKE SURE THERE IS NO NEWLINE AT END OF THIS FILE
: TODO: can I parallelize this for speed?
tail -1 ~/BCGIT/QUORA/badlogs.txt
xargs fgrep -lf ~/BCGIT/QUORA/badlogs.txt < fileshere.txt >! badhere.txt &

: afterwards, LOOK AT badones.txt and "xargs rm"

: The "Too many requests from this IP" pages are usually between 54K
: and 56K, so this may work faster
find . -size +54000c -size -56000c | xargs fgrep -l 'Too many requests from this IP' | tee toomanyrequests.txt

: 70162 byte files are often "An internal server error occurred"
find . -size 70162c | xargs fgrep -l 'An internal server error occurred' | 
 tee servererror.txt

: dont use this directly to rm (too dangerous) but useful double check)
fgrep -L 'Revision #' *.html

: legitimate log files can be as small as 27013 bytes

To break logs into multiple directories, do something like:

: below 100M
: doesnt work for 1-9999 but ok w that (handled manually)
\ls|fgrep .html|perl -nle 's/\.html//;print int($_/10000)'|sort|uniq>! dirs.txt
xargs mkdir < dirs.txt
perl -nle 'print "mv $_????.html $_"' < dirs.txt

: THIS DOES NOT WORK BELOW 100M
\ls | perl -anle 'print substr($_,0,5)' | fgrep 1 | sort | uniq >! dirs.txt
xargs mkdir < dirs.txt
: pipe command below to sh
perl -nle 'print "mv $_* $_"' < dirs.txt

Quora page may have a "qid", "aid", "uid", and many other values (not
necessarily all three letters) which might be
useful. https://www.quora.com/What-is-supercharger?redirected_qid=10279716
is one example where it's used

TODO: Quora has weird tree of strings built up in most pages; figure this out.

Compressibility (for 171120000.html 171129999.html, 10K files):

du before compress: 428.400 MB
zip of all log files: 121.626857 MB
bzip2 of individual files: 138.276MB
tar --bzip: 167.502009MB
zpaq: 42.879668 MB

NOTE: /sitemap/recent and /sitemap/questions do NOT appear to be in
any useful order, despite the implication that /recent is ordered my
most recent questions; for example content on
https://www.quora.com/sitemap/recent?page_id=781 is more recent that
content on main page https://www.quora.com/sitemap/recent (but pages
in middle are more recent, so order isn't reversed either)

Quora pages you can access WITHOUT being logged in:

  - https://www.quora.com/topic/Mathematics (or any specific topic,
  but not list of topics)

  - https://www.quora.com/sitemap/ and possibly all linked pages, in
  particular https://www.quora.com/sitemap/recent and
  https://www.quora.com/sitemap/questions may be useful; as of ~ 30
  Sep 2016, https://www.quora.com/sitemap/questions?page_id=40537 is
  highest page number as is https://www.quora.com/sitemap/recent?page_id=781

  -
  https://www.quora.com/When-do-we-use-a-supercharger-or-a-turbocharger/log
  or ANY questions "metalog", but not the actual linked log pages
  themselves

  - Specific answers like https://www.quora.com/What-is-mathematics-not/answer/Ramandeep-Singh-25

  - NOTE: at one point, quora may've allowed direct no-login access to
  log pages directly

  - Adding ?shared=1 to a URL might allow access without login (to a
  page that otherwise requires a login), but doesn't work for log
  pages and may not work 100%


TODO: create files in subdirectories directly instead of creating and
top level and moving via shell script

TODO: try setting User-Agent to googlebot or similar to see if that
allows passwordless login

The "Generated: " number in quora log source may be the microsecond at
which the page was created/pulled

TODO: can create a quasi "live feed" of all quora questions if/when
scraping in real time

TODO: still need to check that each log file I've scraped is legit
(99.5+% done) and scrape up the missing log files

TODO: get others involved in parallel log scraping to pull everything
down (in conjunction w/ quora request)

TODO: check and perhaps parse log files AS I download them instead of
batching this later (but without slowing down log file downloads)

TODO: upload the log files I have to Internet for safekeeping
(torrent? site/service that wants archival data?)

TODO: allow google to index log entries (unless quora already does
this, but probably not)

TODO: snip down quora log HTML entries (which contain a lot of junk) to just essential information

QUORA TOPICS
============

The list of quora topics is current as of ~ 16 May 2016 1700 UTC.

QUORA USERS
===========

The list of quora users was obtained 26 Jun 2016, contains 2,859,092
users, and should be nearly complete. Because the profile listings
page change dynamically, however, it may not be 100% complete. Format:

page username full/display name

page: the page number on which this user was found:

  - Example: users on
  https://www.quora.com/sitemap/people?page_id=6812 would have page
  set to 6812

  - New users appear to be on page 1.

  - https://www.quora.com/sitemap/people?page_id=14703 shows no
  further page links, so the 14703 pages I scraped appear to be
  complete

  - Some pages, like
  https://www.quora.com/sitemap/people?page_id=12665, list only one
  user (the others may have been deleted), so it's not always 200
  users per page

username: the person's username; this will never contain spaces; to visit this person's profile, https://www.quora.com/profile/username

full/display name: the person's full or display name; this may contain spaces

QUORA QUESTIONS
===============

The list of quora questions is probably complete as of ~ 1 Oct 2016
(approx 8.2 million questions)

GENERAL NOTES
==============

NOTE: Some files in this directory are bzip2'd to save space; in most
cases, you must bunzip2 them to actually use them. In particular,
there is no easy way to use SQLite3 databases when they are bzip2'd
compressed (I believe it's not truly impossible, but would require
some clever coding)

SCHEMA
======

Schema for blockgroups SQLite3 table:

CREATE TABLE blockgroups (
 geoid text, statefp INT, aland DOUBLE, awater DOUBLE,
 intptlat DOUBLE, intptlon DOUBLE, population INT
);

.separator ,
.import /tmp/blockgroups.txt blockgroups
