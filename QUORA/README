NOTE: Some files in this directory are bzip2'd to save space; in most

some clever coding)

Schema for blockgroups SQLite3 table:

CREATE TABLE blockgroups (
 geoid text, statefp INT, aland DOUBLE, awater DOUBLE,
 intptlat DOUBLE, intptlon DOUBLE, population INT
);

.separator ,
.import /tmp/blockgroups.txt blockgroups
