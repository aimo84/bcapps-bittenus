Question: Why is maths used as a term for mathematics?

Text: Although British people have come a long way towards learning English,
they have difficulty with some of the longer words.For example, the UK
is extremely hilly and most of their living spaces have a noticeable
tilt. When British people noticed how level American dwellings were,
they asked what they were called. Unable to pronounce the word
"apartment", they simply referred to them as "flats".The word
"elevator" also being too long for the British tongues, they describe
it by its function: "lift".When introduced to a "parking lot", the
British were able to string together a short noun and a short verb
representing its function: "car park".The word/phrase "French fries"
proved to be a double problem. In addition to containing two long (for
British people) words, it made a reference to their hated enemy, the
French. They took to calling these "chips", which caused a problem
when they were later introduced to actual chips (which they are forced
to call "crisps").French kissing ("snogging"), French bread ("country
style loaves"), French style ("Australian style [a kiss down
under']"), , French-cut panties ("knickers"), French toast ("eggy
bread"), French dressing ("bollocks blood"), French poodles ("sewer
rats"), French vanilla ("piss"), French maid ("Essex girl"), and so on
presented similar problems.The word "crossing" wasn't a problem, but
combining it with "pedestrian" was. Unable to understand this
difficult word, the British fell back on their long history of
miscegenation and called these "zebra crossings".The word
"mathematics" was, of course, far too long for a people who had
difficulty with basic counting: they refer to the "second floor" as
the "first floor", and confuse the number "one billion" with "one
trillion", so they abbreviated it to "maths".NOTE: the reason American
people say "math" is totally different and way more awesome, but I
haven't made it uh, researched it yet.
