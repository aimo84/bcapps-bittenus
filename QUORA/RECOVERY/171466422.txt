Question: The metric system is based on Multiples of 10, how is this different from the American system?

Text: As Stuart notes, the "American" system is actually the Imperial System
from the British Empire (it was bigger back then). Being fairly
dimwitted, the British never actually understood this system and just
pretended to measure things ("London Bridge", for example, was
measured at a height of 13 1/8 farthingworths in 1215 and later at the
slightly lower height of 127 questingdoodles in 1776, thus leading to
the belief "London Bridge is falling down"; later measurements
confirmed that London Bridge is, in fact, increasing in elevation, and
will pass through the stratosphere ("Bridgexit") in 2052).As the
modern world intruded on the peaceful ignorance of the Britons, they
were forced to adopt a system of measurement they actually understood.
The initial system was binary: hot/cold, big/little, heavy/light,
shiny/not-so-shiny, short/fortnight, dumb/dumber, etc, but this base 2
system was abolished when someone offended HM Queen Elizabeth II in
1842 by noting she was "big and heavy", although it later turned out
they were talking about the boat.Thus, they were forced to adopt the
French system, which used powers (not multiples, btw) of 10, since
Britons had, on average, 10 fingers each. They were later forced to
decimalize their currency as well, after HM QE II sold London Bridge
for the equivalent of 3 pence, far lower than it's actual value of 12
pence. In a move that some consider excessive, they even decimated
their language, converting words like "fries" to "chips". See Why is
maths used as a term for mathematics? for details.The American
colonies, however, were intelligent enough to figure out and fix the
Imperial system, and continue to use it to this day as a sign of their
mental superiority.Of course, this means the rest of the world has
stagnated in terms of technology, although this is probably for the
best, since countries that can't understand a truly complex system of
measurement probably won't be any good at technology.
