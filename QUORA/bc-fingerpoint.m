The Earth has a surface area of approximately [math]5.1\times 10^8 \text{km}^2[/math], which is [math]5.1\times 10^{14} \text{m}^2[/math]

When standing, a person takes up as little as a square foot or about [math]\frac{1}{9} m^2[/math]. When lying down, it's still less than [math]2 m^2[/math], but let's use that as an upper bound.

There are between 7 and 8 billion people currently on the planet, so the total amount of space occupied by everyone is between [math]7.78\times 10^8[/math] and [math]1.6\times 10^10[/math] square meters.

Thus, if we treat your finger-point as being infinitesimally thin and randomly selecting a point on the Earth, your chance of hitting someone is between [math]\frac{7.78 10^8}{5.1 10^{14}}[/math] and [math]\frac{1.6 10^{10}}{5.1 10^{14}}[/math] or roughly between 1 in 32000 and 1 in 655527.

Of course, people move around, so if you kept your finger pointed long enough or moved your finger around, your chances would increase.
