  - Because we'll be using nadex.com (TODO: why!) for binary options, look
  at https://www.nadex.com/markets/forex for the list of binary
  options you can trade on NADEX:

    - EUR/USD
    - AUD/USD
    - EUR/GBP
    - GBP/USD
    - USD/CAD
    - AUD/JPY
    - USD/JPY
    - GBP/JPY
    - EUR/JPY
    - USD/CHF

and, through additional research (eg, xe.com, fxtop.com, oanda.com or
some other site that provides or charts historical currency rates),
find a pair that you feel won't drop more than 10%.

**IMPORTANT: If the currency pair you choose drops 10% or more , you
will lose everything you invested AND POSSIBLY MORE. If you feel ALL
of these currency pairs could drop 10% or more, THIS STRATEGY IS NOT
FOR YOU.**

  - To me, GBP/USD looks good, since the last time it was 10% below
  its current value of 1.4569 was in mid-1986, about 30 years ago.

Of course, this isn't a perfect choice (none of the pairs are), since
GBP/USD has gone as low as 1.0438, 28% below it's current value.

However, my feeling (which could be very wrong) is that GBP/USD won't
decrease more than 10% in the next 2-3 years or so.

  - The first part of our strategy involves buying GBP/USD at every
  0.25% change in price, or every multiple of 36 pips. In other words,
  we want to buy GBP/USD at 1.4544 because 36*404 = 14544 (note that
  me multiply the price by 10,000 to get the price in
  pips). Similarly, we will want to buy GBP/USD when the price drops
  or increases to any other multiple of 36 pips such as:

  - 1.4400
  - 1.4436
  - 1.4472
  - 1.4508
  - 1.4544 (as noted above)
  - 1.458
  - 1.4616
  - 1.4652
  - 1.4688

and so on.

  - What happens if GBP/USD does drop 10%? If we invest $35,000 at
  each 36-pip multiple (0.25%), we will have 40 investments of $35,000
  each or a total investment of $1,400,000. Our loss on our first
  (highest priced) investment will be 10%, and our loss on our most
  recent (lowest price) investment will be 0% (since we've purchased
  it at the point where the 10% drop occurred), so our average loss
  will be 5% of $1,400,000 for a total loss of $70,000.

  - We will need an additional 2% margin of $28,000 to hold the
  $1,400,000 position, so our initial total deposit must be at least
  $98,000.

  - If you have less (or more) than $98,000 to invest, there are
  several ways to modify this strategy, but I am using $98,000 as the
  example, and the strategy way work even more poorly with less
  money. Ways to modify the strategy (make sure you understand the
  strategy and confirm your modification is still profitable):

    - Instead of investing $35,000 at each 0.25% (36 pip) change,
    invest a different amount.

    - Instead of investing at every 0.25% change, invest at every
    0.40% (or some other percentage) change.

    - Instead of buying at every 0.25% change all the way down to -10%
    (for 40 positions total if GBP/USD loses 10%), only buy down to
    -5% (20 positions total), but still be prepared for a 10% loss in
    GBP/USD.

    - Of course, you can choose a pair other than GBP/USD.

    - You may want to choose a safety margin larger than 10%, but I
    don't recommend choosing one smaller than 10%.
