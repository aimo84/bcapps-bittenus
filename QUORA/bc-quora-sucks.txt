Thoughts for improving quora by creating a better Q+A board.

Asker can fill out these fields (numerically so they can be sorted/filtered):

<<<<<<< HEAD
  - how much time/effort have you put into this problem yourself? (eg,
  "I'm sure I could do this myself, I'm just being lazy")
=======
  - how much time/effort have you put into this problem yourself?
>>>>>>> 853b97410513fd2a3d6a62c805a7b55ec6721959

  - how competent do you feel in this field (new to me, beginner,
  intermediate, expert, cutting edge of research)

  - what is your estimate of this question's difficulty (eg, grade
  school, university, unsolved problem, etc)

  - what sort of answer do you seek (just a link, brief explanation,
  worked out completely, etc)

  - how urgent is this problem to you? (need answer ASAP, couple of
  days, casual query, don't care)

  - would you be willing to pay someone for an answer, and, if so, how
  much? (note that site itself won't handle or accept payments, but
  others might)

TODO: allow "project level problem" and "seeking collaborators"

Answerer can fill out these fields:

  - Completeness of answer (just a link, some discussion, answers part
  of problem, shows answer is unknown, answers complete problem)

  - Answer is humorous, sarcastic, or otherwise not meant to answer
  the question directly.

The site will have a multi-level ontology so a "special relativity"
question is auto-posted to "relativity", "physics", "science", etc.

Site will have "reputation points" for users/answers/question/etc

Site will have multi-threaded comment/answer replies.

Site will have API and regular data dumps.

Site will allow SQL filtering and sorting of questions (including posting time)

Site will include notification "this comment was posted in response to
an older version of this question/answer and may not be relevant to
the current version"

Question merge will exist, but will try to be smarter.

FAQ for each ontology item if possible

If "ask to answer" feature implemented, will make it clear to everyone
whether they've been invited to answer or not

TODO: voice verification or similar to reduce spam (text verification
using twilio? require existing account w other service?) (or $1 credit card?)

TODO: allow non-posters to tweak ratings set by poster but make it
clear which are tweaked and which are original

TODO: consider copying existing questions from a site like quora or
stackexchange for testing by artificially assigning numbers
