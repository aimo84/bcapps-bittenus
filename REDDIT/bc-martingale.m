Problem provided by instructor.

"You are a plumber who makes $20 an hour. Near where you live, there is a casino which offers a game in which your money bet is doubled with a rate of success at 50%. A game takes 30 seconds to play. Given that information, what is the most efficient way to generate $2,000?"

I don't know how to approach this. Please help! Thank you!

(* probability of martingale success using multiplier 3, start at 1c
bet, init cash is 500 [and then expand], 2000 target *)

(* earn 1c and then double to 2000 *)

Log[2000/.01]/Log[2]

so 9m to play and 1.8s to work, 2^-18 victory chance
