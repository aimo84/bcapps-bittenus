Code for stackoverflow/stackexchange questions

To run java code after compilation (I'm storing the class files in
/tmp for now), example for Main.class

java -cp /tmp Main

% To use bc-stell-travel.pl to create videos:

  - Edit portion above "program starts here; above is config options";
  at some point, these will become command line arguments

  - If desired, change "test20170510alpha" to something else (this is
  where the frames will be rendered)

  - Make sure you don't already have "test20170510alpha*" (or
  whatever) files in your Stellarium save directory.

  - Set your default sky parameters. One way to do this is to cp
  ../ASTRO/STELLARIUM/harey.ssc to a tempfile and then append the
  results of bc-stell-travel.pl to that tempfile.

  - If you're unhappy w/ the parameters of harey.ssc, change them in
  the tempfile you just created.

  - "stellarium --startup-script name_of_tempfile |& tee /tmp/error.txt"

  - If something goes wrong, the /tmp/error.txt is often extremely
  helpful; in particular, if you're using a different version of
  Stellarium, some of the API commands may not be available.

  - After the script starts up, MINIMIZE Stellarium so you can do
  other things; if you don't minimize Stellarium and accidentally
  hover over the left edge (for example), any GUI components you
  generate will appear in your final movie.

  - In your Stellarium save directory: "ffmpeg -i
  test20170510alpha%3d.png test.mp4" (note: the %3d does NOT require
  all files have 3 digit numbers in their names-- it magically works
  regardless)
