How much research have you done on your own? Examples:

  - I have done no research.

  - I've used search engines such as Google, but haven't found
  anything because I'm not sure what terms to search for.

  - I've used search engines with the right terms, but have found
  nothing useful. Examples:

    - The formula I'm seeking is for a limited-use special case, and
    not of general interest.

    - There are several sites that mention the phenomena in which I am
    interested, but do not provide the formulas I need.

    - I am doing original research, and did not find any sites mention
    the phenomena in which I am interested.

What sort of formula do you seek? Examples:

  - I just need search terms or "terms of art"/jargon so I can do more
  searching on my own.

  - I am looking for existing code or a library.

  - I want to write code or a library. I do not want to use existing
  code/library, even if such code is open source. Sample case: I am
  doing an assignment for school.

  - I want to write code or a library and understand what's
  happening. I am looking for a step by step explanation in addition
  to a formula.

  - I have an existing formula, but am looking at special or extreme
  cases where it does not work.

  - I am looking for a closed-form mathematical formula, or an
  explanation of why one doesn't exist.

How precise of an answer do require? Examples:

  - I am doing high precision work and need very high precision.

  - I'm looking for a balance between simplicity and precision.

  - I'm looking for a simple formula, even if it's not very accurate.

Is yours a special case? Examples:

  - I have a formula, but the results it's providing seem wrong in a
  real world sense.

  - I have several unequal formulas, and want to know which is the
  right formula and/or whether each formula applies in a different
  circumstance.

  - I have come up with my own formula, but it disagrees with the
  formulas I've found from other references, and I want to know why.
