(*

Since the gas is ideal and the quantity doesn't change, we have:

P1V1/T1 = P0V0/T0

Let x be the distance the piston is lowered, and r and h be the radius
and original height of the cylinder respectively.

m*g - P0*Pi*r^2

P1*Pi*r^2 = mg, so P1 = mg/Pi/r^2

force on top is 

m*g - P(t)*Pi*r^2

extreme cases: mass doesn't move piston: no work done, no temp change

mass moves piston, no temp change: movement is as above, extra energy is mgh?

P1 = mg/Pi/r^2

3/2*n*r*T1 = 3/2*n*r*T0 + mgx so

T1 = 2mgx/3nR + T0

V1 = V0 - Pi*r^2*x

m*g*Pi/r^2*(V0-Pi*r^2*x)/(2*m*g*x/3/n/R + T0) == P0*V0/T0








T1 = T0
