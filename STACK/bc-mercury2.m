(* notes in case I decide to answer http://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/2392/motion-of-the-sun-as-observed-from-mercury?rq=1

at +0E+0N, Mercury sun rise 8 Nov 2016, set 11 Feb 2017, aphelion (and
thus reverse motion) at "noon" mercury time

TODO: confirm mercury has no atmosphere and dont add it in stellarium

TODO: write stellarium script that shows retro at +0E+0N but perhaps
double sunrise/sunset at ~+90E+0N or even a different latitude (or all 3)

TODO: make sure to get all steallarium options right -- difficult to
show sunrise/set well

TODO: DayOnMercury.swf actually does a fairly good job
