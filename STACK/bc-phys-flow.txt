Outline for how to answer "I've got a new physics theory" question

not here: yes, we would've rejected Einstein/etc, its just not the place; Einstein ok once accepted

Agree w/ current predicts? Do you believe current predicts are bad?

predicts only bad because they disagree w/ theory? circular

predict new behavior? observable/testable? (if no, not scientific)

not predict new behav? combines existing theories well? if no, redundant

TODO: note personal opinion not an official site thingy

if valid, show peeps you know, local uni, etc
