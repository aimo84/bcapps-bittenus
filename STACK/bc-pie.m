I'm not sure I fully understand this question, so I'll answer as best as I can.

If you have a pie with $n$ sectors, you can color the first sector in
any 4 colors.

After that, each sector must be a different color from the previous
sector, so you have 3 choices.

The only possible exception is that the last sector's color must be
different from both the previous sector's color and the first sector's
color.

TODO: say nth and n-1st, not "previous"

TODO: note colors may be same, 3 choices; not same: 2 choices

TODO: no slice

1 slice: 4

2 slices: 4*3 = 12

3 slices: 4*3*2 = 24

4 slices: 4*3*3*depends
