I'm posting this new answer instead of editing my original because this answer serves a different purpose. My original answer used LaTeX and Greek letters to create really fancy looking, but not really very usable, formulas.

In this answer I: 

  - provide formulas that can be computed, not just LaTeX

  - use more familiar abbreviations instead of Greek letters

  - use more familiar units instead of using radians everywhere

  - break down the formulas into sections instead of placing them all in one table.

  - don't provide intermediate calculations or sources, but these are available at https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/STACK/bc-rst2.m


  - ******BRAG****

Of course, it's impossible to avoid all the ugliness of astronomical calculations, but I've tried to simplify as much as possible.

For the answers below:

  - d is the number of days since J2000.0, which is 1200 UTC on 1 Jan 2000.

  - ra is right ascension, in hours

  - dec is declination, in degrees

  - lat is latitude, in degrees

  - lon is longitude, in degrees



TODO: worry about time at 24 and time zones (and disclaim some ugliness still exists)

TODO: ask mr x if I can name him as inspriation

TODO: mention this file, no intermediate

TODO: sources

NOTE: refractions, etc, not taken into account, "geometric"
