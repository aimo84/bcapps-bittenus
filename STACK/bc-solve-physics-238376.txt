@AccidentalFourierTransform's answer in comments is correct, and I'll
provide an example for clarity. By appropriate choice of units, I will
show the following are all equal to 1:

  - speed of light (c)

  - gravitational constant of the universe (G)

  - the ideal gas constant (R)

  - the illuminance of the Sun (Sb)

We'll start with two obvious choices: measuring distance in light
seconds (ls) and time in seconds. This gives us c = 1.

Let G be the gravitational constant of the universe and apply unit
conversion:

$

6.674\times10^{-11}\frac{m^3}{\text{kg} \times s^2}
\times(\frac{\text{ls}}{299792458 m})^3

$


mass of 4.03716 10^35

10^35 = 50K solar masses, 1/1000 globular cluster, zeptobarry =  ~~ ( 0.24 ~~ 1/4 ) mass of all humans alive (~~ 9.30^11 lb )
