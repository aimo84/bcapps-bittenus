Suppose you randomly pick 50 marbles and they are all red.

If there were exactly 100 red marbles (900 black), you could do this
in Binomial[100,50] or 100891344545564193334812497256 ways.

If there were exactly 101 red marbles (899 black), you could do this in
Binomial[101,50] or 199804427433372226016001220056 ways.

In other words, it's
199804427433372226016001220056/100891344545564193334812497256 (which
is 101/51) more likely there are exactly 101 red marbles than there
are exactly 100 red marbles.

In general, there are Binomial[n,50] ways there can be exactly n red
marbles if you picked 50 marbles and all were red.

How many ways can there be at least 990 red marbles (990 = 99% of 1000):

Sum[Binomial[i,50],{i,990,1000}] =
81531993898242794598076623570369772515365019903144264043266969772686950795976808446840

How many ways can there be n red marbles for any value of n?

Sum[Binomial[i,50],{i,0,1000}] =
185684734874564765959015411764819077718596543052359268997222801777737175488143399579280

(which also happens to be Binomial[1001,51])

So the chance we have 990 or more red marbles (if we pick 50 red in a
row) is
81531993898242794598076623570369772515365019903144264043266969772686950795976808446840/185684734874564765959015411764819077718596543052359268997222801777737175488143399579280
or about 43.91%

Now, if we change 50 marbles to k marbles, the chance of 990 or more
red marbles is:

Sum[Binomial[i,k],{i,990,1000}]/Binomial[1001,k+1]

Some results:

To be 50% confident you have 990+ red marbles, pick 60 red marbles.
To be 75% confident, pick 117 red marbles.
To be 90% confident, pick 188 red marbles.  (this is the answer to your question).
To be 95% confident, pick 237 red marbles.
To be 99% confident, pick 340 red marbles.
To be 99.5% confident, pick 380 red marbles.
To be 99.9% confident, pick 464 red marbles.
To be 99.95% confident, pick 496 red marbles.
To be 99.99% confident, pick 564 red marbles.
To be 99.995% confident, pick 591 red marbles.
To be 99.999% confident, pick 646 red marbles.

And, of course, to be 100% confident that 99% of the marbles are red,
pick 990 red marbles.

Given how big these numbers get, using a normal distribution approach
may have been better, though slightly less accurate.
