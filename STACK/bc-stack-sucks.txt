stackexchange.com is a great site to ask questions and receive
professional answers, but it usually takes time to get an answer and
questions are sometimes closed unnecessarily.

Here are some other options:

  - If your question is closed on physics.stackexchange.com (which is
  plagued by "overly aggressive moderators"), try posting on:

    - math.stackexchange.com if your question is mostly mathematical,
    or mathoverflow.net if your question is mathematical and fairly
    high-level.

    - astronomy.stackexchange.com if your question is about astronomy.

    - space.stackexchange.com if your question is about space
    exploration, rocket launches, or anything similar.

    - earthscience.stackexchange.com if your question relates to Earth
    science.

    - gis.stackexchange.com if your question is about GIS or geography.

    - mathematica.stackexchange.com if you are working physics
    problems with Mathematica(tm) software.

    - programmers.stackexchange.com if you are writing a computer
    program to do physics (also stackoverflow.com)

    - scifi.stackexchange.com if you're wondering how physics works in
    an existing science fiction world, or
    worldbuilding.stackexchange.com if you're trying to create a world
    and need help with your fictional physics.

    - http://meta.physics.stackexchange.com/questions/391 also lists
    several possibly helpful sites.

You can also try visiting the Physics StackExchange chat room:
http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/71/the-h-bar where the atmosphere
is generally friendlier. In many cases, they will help you with
homework, even if your problem was closed on the main site.

  - If you need help more urgently, or your question was closed on a
  different StackExchange site, you might try:

    - openstudy.com: near-real-time help, somewhat
    difficult-to-naviate interface

    - wolframalpha.com: if you just need to check your answers, this
    can be helpful, but it's been having a few serious problems later,
    so proceed with caution.

    - quora.com: if your question is more philosophical or
    discussion-based (instead of looking for a specific answer), Quora
    might be the place to post.
