A slightly more useful answer:

Using http://wgc.jpl.nasa.gov:8080/webgeocalc/#NewCalculation "Angular
Separation Finder" feature, we can determine when the angle between
the Sun and the Moon is at a local maximum. It turns out this isn't
*quite* the definition of Full Moon, but it's very close. I couldn't
find a way to make webgeocalc compute full moon times exactly, though
I'm sure there is a way, and, of course, there are plenty of tables of
full moons online.

Starting at
http://wgc.jpl.nasa.gov:8080/webgeocalc/#AngularSeparationFinder
we fill out the form as so:

[[/tmp/6.png]]
[[/tmp/7.png]]

and click the "Calculate" button.

This yields a list of all "full" moons. Scroll down and click on the
"Save All Intervals" button:

We now want to find the moon's distance at all of the times we just
saved (ie, the times of the "full" moons). To do this, start at
http://wgc.jpl.nasa.gov:8080/webgeocalc/#StateVector and fill out as
follows:

[[/tmp/8.png]]
[[/tmp/10.png]]
[[/tmp/11.png]]

NOTE: to get the list of intervals above, drag from the saved
intervals result window into the list of intervals window.

The results, which you can also download, tell you the moon's distance
from the Earth at the times of the "full" moons we computed earlier:

I downloaded the results in Excel format, imported them into gnumeric
and sorted by radius (distance from Earth to Moon) and did a little
additional cleanup to get:
