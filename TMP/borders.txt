Ran on command line and piped to postgis:

shp2pgsql -d -G ne_10m_admin_0_countries.shp

Then these in PostGIS:

CREATE INDEX ne_10m_admin_0_countries_index ON 
ne_10m_admin_0_countries USING GIST(geog); 

DELETE FROM ne_10m_admin_0_countries WHERE name_long = 'Antarctica'; 

SELECT a.name_long, b.name_long, ST_LENGTH(ST_INTERSECTION(a.geog, b.geog))
FROM ne_10m_admin_0_countries a JOIN ne_10m_admin_0_countries b ON
a.name_long NOT IN ('Antarctica') AND
a.name_long < b.name_long WHERE ST_LENGTH(ST_INTERSECTION(a.geog, b.geog)) > 0
;

some cleanup w/ Perl to get borders-out.txt
