# allows multiple people (not just me) to follow others based on

# NOTE: I use *my* (not clients) *twitter* (not supertweet) id to
# connect to the stream. In other words, I could run this program for
# other people using my twitter username/password, even if I didn't
# want to follow anyone myself
