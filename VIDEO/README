Notes on my attempt to create "10 seasons of Full House in 10 minutes"
(video only) on youtube.com; I will likely fail and I doubt these tips
will help anyone, so this contributes to my prime directive of filling
github w/ useless crap.

TODO
====

  - Create frames larger than 1024x768?

  - Do I want changes resolutions when hitting Fuller House or squish?

  - Would it be more efficient to grab frames full screen and then
  resize using montage?

NOTES
=====

  - For seasons 1-8, images are 640x480, scale ratio 4:3

  - For seasons 9-10 ("Fuller House"), images are 1280x720, 16:9 ratio

  - Frame speed is 24 fps

  - Approximately 24 episodes per season but it varies (some episodes
  are "double size")

  - Doing 5x5 should work ok, so 204x153 per episode (allowing for 4x3
  pixel frame which I probably wont use); however ffmpeg encoding
  requires even height so 204x152 (with 4x8 pixel frame if needed)

COMMANDS
========

: this converts first episode of full house into 1808 thumbnails, one
: for each second (24 frames) of the show-- the thumbnails are 209x157
: so I can tile them as above (timed so I can get a general idea)

time ffmpeg -i fh101.avi -vf "select=not(mod(n\,24)), scale=204:152" -vsync vfr img_%03d.jpg

: above takes 17.704u 1.093s 0:16.72 112.3% 0+0k 0+38928io 0pf+0w

: without scaling, this is 19.588u 1.110s 0:18.56 111.4% 0+0k 0+57280io 0pf+0w

: grabbing raw frames is actually slower

: this command lets me see what the upper left of the final video will
: look like, but does not, in and of itself, have any real use to the
: final project

ffmpeg -i img_%03d.jpg test0.mp4

: when piped to shell, this links MANY but not all of the Full House
: episodes to shorter names

perl -le 'for $i (1..8) {for $j ("01".."24") {print "ln -s Full?House?${i}x$j* fh$i$j.avi"}}'

: this frameifies all episodes (after fully converting names)

\ls fh???.avi | perl -nle 'print "ffmpeg -i $_ -vf \47select=not(mod(n\\,24)), scale=204:152\47 -vsync vfr $_.%03d.jpg"' > temp.sh

: since this seems fairly parallelizeable

parallel -j 10 < temp.sh &

: as a sample, lets montage the 1000th frames of season 1 (not using
: the 1st few frames because they tend to blank or similar)-- if this
: works, we can generalize

: the convert below pads the image to 1024x768 which is useful 

montage -geometry 204x152  -tile 5x5 fh1??.avi.1000.jpg - | convert -border 2x4 - out.jpg

: lets find the largest frame number/longest show of season 1 to montage

\ls fh1??.avi.*.jpg | perl -nle '/(\d+)\.jpg$/; print $1' | sort -nr | uniq -c | less

: 1 show goes to 1858 seconds (the next longest is 1816s, and 4 more
: shows go that long, but thats really not relevant)

: lets create 1858 montage images

perl -le 'for $i ("000".."1858") {print "montage -geometry 204x152  -tile 5x5 fh1??.avi.$i.jpg - | convert -border 2x4 - s1f$i.jpg"}' > temp2.sh

: hopefully this parallelizes well (it actually doesnt)

parallel -j 10 < temp2.sh &

: and now, the movie

ffmpeg -i s1f%03d.jpg output.mp4
