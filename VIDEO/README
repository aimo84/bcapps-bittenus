Notes on my attempt to create "10 seasons of Full House in 10 minutes"
(video only) on youtube.com; I will likely fail and I doubt these tips
will help anyone, so this contributes to my prime directive of filling
github w/ useless crap.

TODO
====

  - Create frames larger than 1024x768?

  - Do I want changes resolutions when hitting Fuller House or squish?

NOTES
=====

  - For seasons 1-8, images are 640x480, scale ratio 4:3

  - For seasons 9-10 ("Fuller House"), images are 1280x720, 16:9 ratio

  - Frame speed is 24 fps

  - Approximately 24 episodes per season but it varies (some episodes
  are "double size")

  - For 1024x768 resolution, each ep can take 1024*768/24 = 32768 pixels

  - At 4:3, 32768 pixels is 209x157 (roughly)

  - At 16:9 32768 pixels is 241x136 (roughly)

COMMANDS
========

: this converts first episode of full house into 1808 thumbnails, one
: for each second (24 frames) of the show-- the thumbnails are 209x157
: so I can tile them as above (timed so I can get a general idea)

time ffmpeg -i fh101.avi -vf "select=not(mod(n\,24)), scale=209:157" -vsync vfr img_%03d.jpg

: above takes 17.780u 1.050s 0:16.76 112.3%   0+0k 0+40488io 0pf+0w

: this command lets me see what the upper left of the final video will
: look like, but does not, in and of itself, have any real use to the
: final project

ffmpeg -i img_%03d.jpg test0.mp4


DISCLAIMER
==========

  - This idea isn't original: someone did it w/ Friends (in a slightly
  different way) WITH audio
