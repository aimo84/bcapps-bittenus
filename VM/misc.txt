% Machine creation:

name is: centos7, centos68, fedora24, mint18, debian86

TODO: 

  - tweak storage for CD

  - tweak network for bridged, MAC addr and promiscuous

  - NOT: tweak shared folders /mnt mnt and not read only (experimental)

  - store snapshot

pw is abc123 for test machines (in case I wish to share)

user "user" created w/ no pw and is adminstrator

network interface is bridged, MAC is 08 00 00 00 00 0x (x= 1 - 5)

router will autoassign ip addresses in that order

preinstall state includes CD in drive

centos are redhat linux 64

mint is ubuntu



% Stuff I do on brighton to control guests

[root@brighton VirtualBox VMs]# VBoxManage list

% MAC addresses set to: 08:00:00:00:00:01 through 05 all = promiscious to all

% using "bridged" in all cases so I can access it from other machines
on my LAN, reserving these IPs from router (main router, not virtual)

% reset all to postinstall state to see what they come up with

none of them are pingable at reboot




: below does not show IP address
VBoxManage showvminfo pavilion | less


VBoxManage guestproperty enumerate pavilion

VBoxManage natnetwork list pavilion

: maybe useful storageattach

: what is controlvm keyboardputscancode
