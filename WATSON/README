For IBM Watson stuff

Steps (following https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/discovery/getting-started.html)

  - Obtain a free bluemix.net account if you don't already have one

  - Go to https://console.bluemix.net/, log in

  - Click on "Catalog", "Watson", "Discovery", "Create"

  - Click on the newly created Discovery instance (mine was named "discovery-rb", yours might have a slightly different name)

  - Click on "service credentials", then "New Credential +", and then "Add"

  - Click on "view credentials" and store these JSON credentials in a safe, non-publicly accessible file (in my programs here, this is $private{watson}{json} loaded from a non-GIT file)

  - Do the following ONCE and note down the results privately (using your actual username/passowrd) to obtain an "environment":

curl -X POST -u "{username}":"{password}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "name":"my-first-environment", "description":"exploring environments"} "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api/v1/environments?version=2017-09-01"

  - Your environment may take some time to set up. Run this command occasionally until your environment is ready:

curl -u "{username}":"{password}" https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api/v1/environments/{environment_id}?version=2017-09-01

with the environment id you received above until you see:

"status" : "active"

in the result.

  - Now get the "configuration" of your environment:

curl -u "{username}":"{password}" "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api/v1/environments/{environment_id}/configurations?version=2017-09-01"

and note it down.

  - To obtain a "collection" for your environment:

curl -X POST -u "{username}":"{password}" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "*my-first-collection*", "description": "exploring collections", "configuration_id":"{configuration_id}" , "language": "en_us"}' "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api/v1/environments/{environment_id}/collections?version=2017-09-01"

  - Check if your collection is ready (repeat below until it is):

curl -u "{username}":"{password}" "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api/v1/environments/{environment_id}/collections/{collection_id}?version=2017-09-01"

until you see:

"status" : "active" 

in the result.

  - You can now upload documents to your collection:

curl -X POST -u "{username}":"{password}" -F "file=@test-doc1.html" https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/discovery/api/v1/environments/{environment_id}/collections/{collection_id}/documents?version=2017-09-01

Note the files must be in one of the accepted formats:

application/json
application/msword
application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document
application/pdf
text/html
application/xhtml+xml

If the document is NOT in one of these formats, the /documents method will try to convert it; if conversion is impossible, the upload will fail.

  - The reply you receive will include '"status": "processing"'. Your document may not be available immediately.
