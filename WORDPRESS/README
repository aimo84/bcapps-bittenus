# lets me make posts by editing (+ potentially modifying/parsing) them
# locally

TODO:

  - Convert wondertwin-powers remote plugin to local to the extent possible

  - Convert other plugins to local where possible

  - Allow markup and format locally before sending to wp (use
  BCINFO3/sites/ASTRO/markdown-modified.pl ?)

  - "make" program that touches .lastrun(.new) and reuploads whatever
  has changed (using bc-post-file.pl)

  - If converting LaTeX to HTML, allow users to see raw LaTeX and
  MathML as well (just link to .wp file?)

  - Create a .wpp file for each .wp file which is what actually gets
  uploaded to wp (after tags have been processed, markup, etc)

  - Perhaps convert all new formulas to ROSETTA and link that
  automatically as well

  - Create "[bc:volatile]" 'tag' that autoparses to say "this post
  changes a lot -- here's an RSS feed to just this page" (worry: some
  RSS readers don't handle single-item feeds well?) (see
  https://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/69641/why-does-ifttt-dislike-this-rss-feed
  but hopefully fixed)

  - Create tags in general

  - Verify category exists, esp. in new posts

  - Add JSON feed as well?

  - Test subscribe to some of my own single page feeds (via IFTTT?)

  - I have a lot of "private" posts (that won't show up
  BCINFO3/sites/JEKYLL/myblog or whatever) that I should rapidly
  approve (mostly BARRY-AFTER-VARK and labelled VARK-ZOMBIE for now)

  - Several of my VARK posts have questions w/o answers (or bad answers) that I have long since figured out; edit these posts!

  - If I delete a file locally, it should be deleted remotely as well
  (this is tricky, could look at dir mod time, but ugly)

  - Cleanup bc-post-file.pl and move all configuration options out

ERRORS:

  - bc-parse-wxr.pl is currently parsing post_author as a HASH
