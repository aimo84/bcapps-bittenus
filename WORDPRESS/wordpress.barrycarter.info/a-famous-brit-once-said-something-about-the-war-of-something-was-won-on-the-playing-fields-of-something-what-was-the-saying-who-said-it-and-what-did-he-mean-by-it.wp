post_title: A famous Brit once said something about "the war of something was won on the playing fields of something". What was the saying, who said it, and what did he mean by it?

======================================================

(You): A famous Brit once said something about "the war of something was won on the playing fields of something". What was the saying, who said it, and what did he mean by it?

(Claude): "The battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton." Attributed to Wellington, but that's not entirely certain. Meant that British "public school" education made leaders capable of defeating enemies like Napoleon.

----------------------

(Benny): The first Duke of Wellington is credited for saying "The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton", but it is unlikely that he actually did. (Refer to Wikipedia for details: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Wellesley,_1st_Duke_of_Wellington )

----------------------

(Leslie): The Duke of Wellington is often quoted as saying that "The Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing-fields of Eton". Eton is a boys school (13-18) and he was implying that the rough and tumble sports there helped supply them with the necessary courage, strength, and tenacity to defeat Napoleon at Waterloo.
