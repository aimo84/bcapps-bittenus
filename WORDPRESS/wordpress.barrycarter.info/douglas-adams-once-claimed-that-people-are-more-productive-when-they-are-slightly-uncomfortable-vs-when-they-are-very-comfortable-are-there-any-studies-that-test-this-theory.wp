======================================================

(You): Douglas Adams once claimed that people are more productive when they are slightly uncomfortable vs when they are very comfortable. Are there any studies that test this theory?

(Ran): Every cube in the corporate world suggests the same thing. I know of no actual studies, however.

(You): interesting, thanks.

----------------------

(Loren): Considering Douglas Adams also said the answer to life the universe and everything is the number 42 (and we're still lacking the question to this day, unless the mice have it and just don't feel like letting on) I don't give much value to the statement on the surface. However, considering the statement in itself makes sense, I'll take a leap of faith and hope we don't become the back end of donkeys by assuming there are studies out there... even if finding them would probably be more difficult than trying to arrive late to the resturaunt at the end of the universe.

(Loren): well, well well... as good as it sounds, it appears not to be true - if we can value the contents of this one study report I was able to find: http://www.johnsoncontrols.com/publish/us/en/products/building_efficiency/integrated_hvac_systems/hvac/personal_environments/research.html

(Connie): There are studies looking at this from a few different angles.  Probably the most well known is the 'fight or flight' phenomenon.  It is well documented that a perceived threat triggers a physiological response or 'hyper' response where the body is capable of doing things not possible in a relaxed state.  This explains how a person can do something like lift a vehicle off a trapped child when they could not do this without the crisis situation.
