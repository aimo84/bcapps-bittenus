post_title: How do I use Unix's find command to find all files starting at "/" but excluding files in /tmp /proc /dev and /var/tmp ? I know it involves -path and -prune, but I don't understand exactly how to combine them.

======================================================

(You): How do I use Unix's find command to find all files starting at "/" but excluding files in /tmp /proc /dev and /var/tmp ? I know it involves -path and -prune, but I don't understand exactly how to combine them.

(Andy): For this you just "or" the whole mess of things to exclude together, so

something like this:





find / -path '/proc' -prune -o -path '/dev' -prune -o -path '/tmp' -o -path

'/var/tmp' -prune -o &lt;whatever you want to do to these files&gt;





that says

"if the path is /proc, prune it, or if the path is /dev prune it ..(other

prunes).. or else do whatever"



This works on Debian linux, find can work a little different from one

platform to the next but this should work OK.

(You): thanks!

(Cristian): This is an example:

 find /  -path /tmp -prune -o -path /var -prune  -o -print

Logic is:

Find from /, but with file that match with /tmp do nothing, or (actually XOR) if file match with /var do nothing or (else!) print file name and descend into.

(You): thanks!
