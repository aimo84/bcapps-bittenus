post_title: How To Tell If You're A Mathematician 

======================================================

If you hear this joke:

<blockquote>
Salesman: This computer is guarenteed to cut your workload by 50%.
Customer: OK, I'll take two!
</blockquote>

and think "that'll cut his workload by 75%".
