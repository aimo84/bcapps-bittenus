post_title: I have glucose blood test strips that require a code (by inserting a plastic "key" in the back of the glucose monitor). However, I forgot which strips go with which code (I accidentally opened multiple bottles of strips at once). Two questions: 1) can I get the code off the bottle itself, and 2) can I set the code even if I don't have the plastic key? I'm using the old style Accu-Check meters (not the Aviva).
