post_title: I love 30 Rock, but the jokes go by so fast, I often miss them. Where can I find a transcript/script for the show?

======================================================

(You): I love 30 Rock, but the jokes go by so fast, I often miss them. Where can I find a transcript/script for the show?

(Joseph): I don't know about finding full scripts, but for the jokes, you can search on Wikiquote.org for 30 Rock and each episode has an itemized list of the jokes and other quotes.

(You): I just looked at some of the recent episodes, and there's only 1-2 jokes per episode on wikiquotes?

----------------------

(Caroline): Watch it online again, sites like sidereel or tvduck will have links

(You): I have it on On Demand and can even rewind, etc, but even then I miss some of the jokes (plus rewinding breaks up the show's flow). And sometimes it's hard to hear what the actors are saying (mumbled undertones). I really need some sort of word-based script.
