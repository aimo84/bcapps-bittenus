post_title: I put a can of 16oz of (Texas-style) chili into a 16oz styrofoam cup and was surprised at first that the chili overflowed the cup. Then I realized chili is sold by weight (mass), not volume. What is the density of bean chili, roughly speaking?

======================================================

(You): I put a can of 16oz of (Texas-style) chili into a 16oz styrofoam cup and was surprised at first that the chili overflowed the cup. Then I realized chili is sold by weight (mass), not volume. What is the density of bean chili, roughly speaking?

(Frederic): Density of water is 1 g/mL. Everything that is mainly made of water will have about the same density.

(You): well, if the density were 1 g/mL, it wouldn't overflow a 16oz cup!

(Frederic): 16 oz is 454 g, and 16 fluid oz is 448 g, so if the density is 1g/mL, there would be 8 mL over. If the density is a little less, the overflow will be a little more...

----------------------

(Terri): depends on the type and whatever. Just divide mass by volume with whatever it says on the can, but you probably already knew that. great question though lol!

(You): thanks, I aim to please, question-wise. The can mentions the weight, but not the volume.

(Terri): hmm, then i would say measure the volume of the can by filling it with water and then pouring the water out and measuring the volume of the water. hope i helped!

(You): that sounds like a lot of work.

(Terri): not really, use a standard kitchen measuring cup?

(You): no, I mean it would actually involve getting up from the computer ;)

(Terri): that's unfortunate then :/

(You): yes, I might try it later, when I get up naturally. I

(You): I'm thinking maybe 2014...

(Terri): okayy, good luck with that then :]

----------------------

(Claude): I'm not sure what the density of chili is, but note that if it was water, 16 oz. (weight) of water would occupy slightly LESS than a 16 fl.oz. cup. That's because an ounce is 28.35 grams, and a fluid ounce is 29.57 milliliters. And by definition a milliliter of water weighs a gram. So I'm surprised that chili occupies more space than water, i.e. is less dense, but I don't have a number.

(You): wow, thanks! you're right. I forgot that a fluid ounce and a weight ounce aren't equivalent, even for water. Nice catch.
