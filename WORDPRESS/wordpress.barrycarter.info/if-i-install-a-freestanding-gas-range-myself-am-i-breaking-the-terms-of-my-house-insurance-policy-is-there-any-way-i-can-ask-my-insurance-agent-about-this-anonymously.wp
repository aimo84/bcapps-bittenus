post_title: If I install a freestanding gas range myself, am I breaking the terms of my house insurance policy? Is there any way I can ask my insurance agent about this anonymously?

======================================================

(You): If I install a freestanding gas range myself, am I breaking the terms of my house insurance policy? Is there any way I can ask my insurance agent about this anonymously?

(Stacie Tau): I believe it is fine, so long as you have your gas company send an inspector to check it.  Try to schedule them as soon as you will finish installation.  This service is free with the gas companies as far as I have experienced.

(You): I'll call NMGCO and check, thanks! That sounds like a good compromise between overpaying someone + having a claim denied later!
