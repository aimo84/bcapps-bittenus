post_title: In https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/bc-dns-server.pl [https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/bc-dns-server.pl] I have 'require "bclib.pl";' which is really https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/bclib.pl [https://github.com/barrycarter/bcapps/blob/master/bclib.pl] -- is there anyway I can coerce github into turning bclib.pl into a link to the latter location in 'web view' mode?
