post_title: Is Italian sausage (bulk, not links) high in sugar?

======================================================

(You): Is Italian sausage (bulk, not links) high in sugar?

(Jeffrey): Most items have some sort of natural sugar and sodium.  The best sausage to buy are those free of antibotics and natural. Always read the ingredience.

(You): but, in general, are the spices they use to turn sausage into Italian sausage... high in sugar?

----------------------

(Jurgen): No but it is high in fat and proteins.

(You): good, I need my proteins.
