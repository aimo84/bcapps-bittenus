post_title: Is there a free online service that will dial my phone simply so I get the "call waiting" flash and can disengage myself from a hideously dull conversation?

======================================================

(You): Is there a free online service that will dial my phone simply so I get the "call waiting" flash and can disengage myself from a hideously dull conversation?

(Le): there is for iPhone, Android and Window Mobile but dont know exactly the name

(You): thanks. I meant a general web service where you'd type in your phone number and they'd call you.

(Le): there is sure no such website doing that, just use your another phone to call yourself.

(You): what if you don't have another phone?

(Le): :)), hang up based on "network dropping"

(You): yes, but it's better if I can say "I have to take this" and then reschedule or something. Dropping isn't always an option.

(Le): like i said, as I knew, there is no such that kind of site but there is software for your phone.

----------------------

(Mark): Google voice.  You can have it call whatever number you want.  To accomplish what you need, just have it call you while your in your call.

----------------------

(Sanjeev): *Even in a normal call waiting scenario the person on the other side never

gets to know you are getting a call waiting...so i suggest you dont look for

a software but just say you have a call in waiting and put the person on

hold...and disconnect a few seconds later :)
