post_title: Is there a twitter bot or something that auto-tweets every few seconds for testing purposes?

======================================================

(You): Is there a twitter bot or something that auto-tweets every few seconds for testing purposes?

(Stella): try this link http://autotweet.info/2009/11/how-to-create-an-auto-retweet-twitter-bot/

(You): wow! I wasn't wanting to create a bot, just find one that already existed to test some code I'd written.
