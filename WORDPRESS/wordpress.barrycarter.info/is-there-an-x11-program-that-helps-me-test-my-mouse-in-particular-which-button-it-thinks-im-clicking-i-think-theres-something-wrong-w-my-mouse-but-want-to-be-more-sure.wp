post_title: Is there an X11 program that helps me test my mouse; in particular, which button it thinks I'm clicking? I think there's something wrong w/ my mouse, but want to be more sure.

======================================================

(You): Is there an X11 program that helps me test my mouse; in particular, which button it thinks I'm clicking? I think there's something wrong w/ my mouse, but want to be more sure.

(Tommy): https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Get_All_Mouse_Buttons_Working

----------------------

(Carol): what kind of mouse do you have?

(You): it's actually a trackball with two buttons -- the middle button emulation (pushing both buttons at once) seems a little flaky as does the left mouse button by itself... I think it's not registering correctly.

(Carol): Have you ever tried Steermouse?  Here is the link http://plentycom.jp/en/steermouse/

(You): I don't think it's a driver issue.. I think the mouse itself is damaged... I just need a place to test it. I can't use a real application because it messes things up. It'd be ideal to have a "test app" that just tells me what my mouse is doing
