post_title: Long conversation between scammers

======================================================

[This was originally posted at 419eater.com before I was banned there 
(for reasons best left unexplored &lt;G&gt;). A 419 scam is when 
someone offers to send you a lot of money [lottery, inheritance, found 
money, etc] for a small amount of money [eg, fees, bribe costs, 
"shipping and handling", etc]. Any such offer is a scam: you will send 
the money, and never get anything back in return] 
 
I set up a plivo.com number to forward to a known scammer while 
recording the call, and then asked other known scammers to call that 
number. Here is the 16m21s recording (the target scammer knows the 
person calling is a fellow scammer):

[let me know if you can help me transcribe this] 
 
The call resulted from this letter that I'd sent to many known scammers: 
 
<blockquote> 
From: John Smith Attorney at Law <barr.jsmith4@lawyer.com> 
To: {recipient address} 
Subject: Please call me at home 
 
I am an attorney, but I do not want to handle this through my office, 
given the amount involved. 
 
Could you call me at my home phone +1-602-354-{my plivo.com bait 
number, which forwards to +19376198458, recording the entire 
conversation as it does} 
 
Please do not contact me at my office email again, this is not 
something I want to share with my partners. 
 
Thank you, John Smith (Atty at Law, Lices. AZ) 
</blockquote> 
 
[yes, "Lices. AZ" is a cheap shot at Arizona]
