post_title: Some diabetes meters advertise that you can test (your blood) at multiple sites (on your body). Can't any diabetes meter do this? Why would blood from one part of my body have a different sugar level then from another part? Blood is fairly homogenous, no?

======================================================

(You): Some diabetes meters advertise that you can test (your blood) at multiple sites (on your body). Can't any diabetes meter do this? Why would blood from one part of my body have a different sugar level then from another part? Blood is fairly homogenous, no?

(Christopher): most people find they get different readings from different parts of their body.  also, the meters that advertise "alternate sites" tend to require a smaller sample size (it's harder/more painful to get a bigger blood drop from, say, your forearm than it is from your finger).

(You): thanks. It seems weird that blood in different parts of my body has different amounts of sugar-- I assume this is above/beyond the inaccuracy in most meters?

(Christopher): it is. i don't often use alt. sites, but i have read many forums where people have done comparisons.  can't say I really understand the chemistry.

(You): this leads to the possibility that testing from different fingers would give different results?

(Christopher): indeed.  between meter inaccuracy, possible contamination etc, it's tough to have too much confidence in any one reading

(You): so switching fingers on different days could lead to inaccuracy... sigh.

----------------------

(Andreas): Yes it is mostly the same concentration .

You usually take glucose test on your fingertips simply because the skin there is thinner.

(You): ok, so why do some meters advertise you can take blood at multiple points on your body?
