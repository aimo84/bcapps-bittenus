======================================================

(You): Subject: Why do diabetes meters have tabs that you have to replace each time you get a new set of blood test strips?

(Andrew): each batch of strips is slightly different and the chips that you put into your glucometer that comes with the pack of strips is specially coded for that batch.

----------------------

(Able): As I understand it, the strips have to be calibrated for accuracy reasons.

(Alejo): Hi Barry, I hope you are managing well your diabetes. 



Not all devices need to use the tab (calibrator strip) to calibrate the

glucose meter. In a few of them the test strip you insert is used to

calibrate it.



In most of them though, you use the calibration tab, every time you open a

new box, provided the box is not the same lot number as the one you were

using before. When I buy many boxes at a time I make sure they are all the

same lot number so as to avoid calibrating each time a new box is opened. I

just calibrate the glucose meter when I open the first box.



 



I cannot give you an exact explanation of why calibration is needed, but I

assume that in the manufacturing process some variables may change and not

all production lots are identical. To correct these differences between lots

is that the calibration process is needed.



 



I do around 12 glucose tests per day, and I have been on insulin for the

last 28 years, so if you need any further assistance, I will be willing to

use my experience to help.

(Julie): Most meters need to be "coded" because there are small differences between different batches of strips. Sometimes it doesn't make a huge difference if you don't change the code but sometimes it really does. Try it out by using a strip from a new vial without changing the chip and then change the chip. (The tricky part here is that there is abou a 15% tolerance built into the system anyway. You can use the same drop of blood, same meter, same code, but 2 different strips and a 220 and a 235 are really the same result!!!! That's why your diabetes care provider [and you too!] ought to be looking at your glucose logs for patterns rather than individual readings. Frustrating though, at the moment.)



So, be sure to code your meter with each new vial so that you're getting the most accurate result possible.
