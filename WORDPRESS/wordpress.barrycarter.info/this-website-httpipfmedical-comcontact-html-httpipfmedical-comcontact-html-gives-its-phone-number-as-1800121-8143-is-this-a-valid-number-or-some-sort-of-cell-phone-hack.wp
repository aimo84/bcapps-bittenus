post_title: This website http://ipfmedical.com/contact.html [http://ipfmedical.com/contact.html] gives its phone number as 1(800)121-8143 -- is this a valid number or some sort of cell phone hack?

======================================================

(You): This website http://ipfmedical.com/contact.html [http://ipfmedical.com/contact.html] gives its phone number as 1(800)121-8143 -- is this a valid number or some sort of cell phone hack?

(Ian): why do you think it's a cell phone hack?

(You): I've never seen an 800 number that starts with "1". In fact, I don't think ANY area code has a number starting with "1".

(Ian): It appears to be a legitimate prefix now, according to a Google search.

(You): interesting... I know that 0 and 1 were the only valid digits for an area code many years ago, and that's changed, so maybe now "1" is a valid first number in a 7-digit number. Weird.

(Ian): Yeah, they're probably running out of numbers and had to allow it?

(You): that's my guess too. But it still seems weird. Are they going to start using "0" next? Blech!

----------------------

(Kurin): It is a valid number, and seems to be directly linked to blood donation.

(You): thanks.
