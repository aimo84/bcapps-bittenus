post_title: What is Richard Stallman's relationship w/ Linus Torvalds?

======================================================

(You): What is Richard Stallman's relationship w/ Linus Torvalds?

(robsclone): Stallman created the Gnu public license that projects like Linux are released under. Not sure of any personal relationship together, but Stallman has spoken out against Linus Torvalds before

(You): thanks, that's what I thought too. I know Stallman thinks Linux should be called GNU/Linux, but didn't know how he felt about Linux's creator.

----------------------

(Subhash): no idea

(You): ok, thanks for answering?

(Subhash): i was expecting a technical question not about the relationship

(You): oh, I sent the question to vark in general, not to you specifically.

(Subhash): I know, vark directed to me.

(You): cool.
