post_title: What's the Perl equivalent of try/catch? Is eval and $@ the only way?

======================================================

(You): What's the Perl equivalent of try/catch? Is eval and $@ the only way?

(Rich): Yes. eval{}; and $@ are the way to do it in base Perl. However, there are various modules that do this. See http://search.cpan.org/~ash/TryCatch-1.003000/lib/TryCatch.pm [http://search.cpan.org/~ash/TryCatch-1.003000/lib/TryCatch.pm] for example.

(Rich): See also http://search.cpan.org/search?query=catch&mode=all

(You): thanks! The corrected URL worked :)

----------------------

(Alexander): perl doesn't have exceptions, this can only be simulated with eval

(Alexander): major minus for perl, I think

(You): thanks. There are modules which can simulate try/catch, someone else told me http://search.cpan.org/search?query=catch&mode=all [http://search.cpan.org/search?query=catch&mode=all]
