post_title: When I click the middle mouse button in fvwm and choose "(De)Iconify", I can use SHIFT/CTRL/ALT left-arrow and right-arrow to move the cursor around (instead of just the mouse). However, neither the mouse, nor the keyboard will let me move into another virtual screen. How do I fix fvwm2 to let me choose "minimize" and then move to another part of my virtual screen?
