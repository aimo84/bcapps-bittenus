post_title: Where can I build a test site, step-by-step, using Joomla or some other CMS? I don't have any real sites in mind, so I need some sort of example site to build, or a step-by-step follow along tutorial. Please don't point me to tutorials in general, since I haven't found one that takes you through building a site one step at a time.

======================================================

(You): Where can I build a test site, step-by-step, using Joomla or some other CMS? I don't have any real sites in mind, so I need some sort of example site to build, or a step-by-step follow along tutorial. Please don't point me to tutorials in general, since I haven't found one that takes you through building a site one step at a time.

(Michael): You might consider following along with the Symfony PHP framework tutorial that shows how they built Askeet, but Symfony is more a framework that a CMS. Another thing to check out is the Drupal site. Drupal is definitely a CMS, is relatiely robust and has a good step by step sample app on their site (though I can't recall what the sample app is at this time)

(You): thanks. Question: if I'm not aware I need a CMS (Joomla/Drupal), do I need one? What does it do for me that I can't do myself?

----------------------

(Sebastian): You can try and build a hosted Drupal site at drupalgardens.com. There is no one tutorial to build a web site built on a CMS framework as they are modular by nature. When looking for tutorial include 'site recipes' with your search term and you are

More likely to find a more complete tutorial.



Hope that helps.
