======================================================

(You): Where can I download Square One TV songs like "TimeKeeper" and "Prime Numbers" (the latter by the Jets)?

(Daniel): There's a lot of good stuff on You Tube, but other than that, Square One stuff is hard to find.

(You): so CTW/PBS doesn't give it away directly?

(Daniel): No, all the resarch I've done points to CTW being very stingy about that content. (with no intentions to release)

(You): weird. I thought they were into that non-profit stuff.

----------------------

(Saami): answer search on 4shared.com
