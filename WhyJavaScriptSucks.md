Should be called netscript or ECMAscript: naming it after Java is plain confusing (Sun Microsystems made a mistake by allowing this, but JS doesn't have to continue with this mistake)

node.js sounds like a library for client-side js, but is something else entirely

JS libraries sometimes work with node.js, sometimes with client-side JS, sometimes both, and there's no clear distinction between the two

JS and node.js have different commands

<script src="..."></script> allows HTML to load JS scripts completely, but no such functionality exists in the language itself

Inherent asynchronicity is a good idea, but it should be easier to turn off for those more used to synchronous programming

"Object.keys(object)" instead of "object.keys()"

MINOR: no "<=>" operator
