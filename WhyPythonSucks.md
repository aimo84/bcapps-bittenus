  - Hashes are called dictionaries

  - Whitespace is significant, making it difficult to comment out code
  for testing

  - In hash creation, disallows {color: "red"} to mean {"color": "red"}

  - Uses "//" for integer division, many other languages use it as a comment

  - `for (int i=0; i<=10; i++) {print(i);}` doesn't work, even using Bython
