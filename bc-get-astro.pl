# splinters from bc-get-weather.pl to provide astronomical information
# for X window background (bc-bg.pl) for next minute (to avoid 1m
# lag), and schedules <h>(pron. say-joules)</h> at job to call itself
# again when needed; unlike bc-get-weather.pl, uses Astro::Nova and
# does better job with moon rise/set
