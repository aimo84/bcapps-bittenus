# this is a sample of how an extended tasklist should look like; it's
# basically a list of hashes separated by double newlines and the
# keys/values are separated with an ampersand with optionally a single
# newline, and the keys are separated from the values using an equal
# sign

# Fields that are meaningful to bc-tasklist-extended.pl:
#
#   - frequency: how frequently should I run this task (seconds)
#   - name: simple name of this task, also used for log files
#   - cmd: if given, the command to run when this task is performed
#   - description: if given, the long description of the task
